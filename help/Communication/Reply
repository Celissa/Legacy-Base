<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
This command is a method to tell to people whom you can not see or a<br>
shorthand while carrying on a conversation with someone.  Should be wary<br>
of using it unlocked for private conversations as if someone tells to you<br>
just before you send your reply, the message may very well go to an<br>
unintended recipient.<br>
