<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
keyword [list of words] : set your keywords (no commas)<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
This command is used to set the words which the player can be referenced<br>
by.  They are only checked if the player is unrecognized and thus should<br>
not include the player's name.  See help appearance for more detail.<br>
Players should give themselves at least four or five keywords to avoid<br>
confusion.  Keywords should include your race and everything in your<br>
appearance, except prepositions and conjunctions.  Keywords should not be<br>
separated by commas, just spaces.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
<br>
Keyword slim elf hazel eyes<br>
<br>
That would set the keywords for an elf mage whose description and<br>
appearance describe him or her as 'a slim elf with hazel eyes.' Pretty<br>
straightforward, eh?<br>
<br>
Any unique keywords must be taken from your description, or from an IC<br>
characteristic of your character.  Anachronistic words will not be<br>
approved.<br>
