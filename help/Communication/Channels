Swearing is not allowed on any global channels, so please, be<br>
considerate.  We cannot monitor all channels so all players are<br>
responsible for their own behavior and that of their fellows.  If someone<br>
offends you, it is up to you to speak up or contact an imm.  We try but<br>
cannot be everywhere at once, so be warned.<br>
<br>
Using languages other than english on the channels will result in lost<br>
gossip points.<br>
