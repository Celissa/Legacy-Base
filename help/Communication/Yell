<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
yell [string] : sends a string to all rooms in your area<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Use yell to send a message to everyone in your present area.  It costs no<br>
gossip points, and can be useful if, for instance, you become separated<br>
from your group in a perilous place (and you like to roleplay).  It is also<br>
of use when communicating with others not in your group, but still nearby.<br>
If you wish to send a string to the entire mud, see the Shout command.<br>
<br>
Note that like Chat, Gossip, Auction, and even Shout, this is a channel in<br>
which profanity is not acceptable.<br>
