<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
There are many boards which can be read by mortals.  They are not located<br>
at any specific area.  Rather, you can read them at any place, awake or<br>
asleep.  The list of boards you can read can be accessed by typing note<br>
boardlist.  You will see (iflag level x) next to the board's title.  This<br>
is the minimum number you have to have 'iflag notes' set to in order to<br>
see the Info || statements associated with that board.<br>
