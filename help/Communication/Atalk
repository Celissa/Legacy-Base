<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
This global channel, which costs 10 gossip points, is to be used<br>
exclusively for auction related chat.  It isn't a forum to give out stats<br>
on items but rather a place to ask for items to be auctioned and such. <br>
Persons who do decide to give out object stats on this channel can<br>
reasonably expect to have their gossip points reduced.<br>
<br>
