whistle : whistle<br>

<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Whistling is how you attract your pets.  If they are within a certain<br>
range, they will hear your summons and respond, moving toward you to the<br>
best of their abilities and movement.  Due to their unique racial<br>
characteristics, lizardmen are unable to whistle and must therefore find<br>
some other means of communicating with their pets.<br>
<br>
Note: Whistling doesn't work if your pets are sleeping.<br>
