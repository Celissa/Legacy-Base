<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
.  Languages are an integral part of the culture of each race.  Every<br>
distinct race has its own language, and there are ten total.  In order<br>
for a member of one race to communicate with another, both the speaker<br>
and listener of the chosen language must have a good working knowledge of<br>
the language.  A lack of language ability on either the speaker's or the<br>
listener's part will make communications difficult if not impossible.  <br>
<br>
