<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
emote [text] <br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Sometimes the socials available (see help socials) do not contain<br>
that very special action you wish to perform in front of others.  To<br>
tailor your expressive feelings, you can use the emote command.  An<br>
example: typing 'emote wails like a banshee', will have other players in<br>
the room see [your name] wails like a banshee.<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
Emote is NOT to be used as a means of circumventing language barriers.<br>
