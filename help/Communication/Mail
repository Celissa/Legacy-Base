<br>
mail #           : either displays that letter (if not editting),<br>
                    inserts/deletes that line. (See help editor)<br>
mail [subject]   : begins editting new letter with subject [subject]<br>
mail send [name] : sends the mail being editted to [name] <br>
mail delete      : erases the letter being editted<br>
mail delete #    : erases that message<br>
mail delete all  : deletes all mail messages<br>
mail cc [name]   : sends a copy of mail being edited to [name],<br>
                    but you continue to edit it.<br>
mail edit #      : copies the specified message to the mail buffer<br>
  <br>
