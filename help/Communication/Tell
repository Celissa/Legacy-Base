<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
tell                    : list the most recent tells you have received<br>
tell [player] [message] : send a private message to a specific player<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The 'tell' command allows private communication between players.  Unlike<br>
chat, gossip, and auction, which are all public channels, and<br>
even grouptell, tell is a private channel which only includes<br>
yourself and your 'target.' Use of tell thus enables you to have secure<br>
conversations and helps reduce spam on the public channels.<br>
<br>
To list the most recent 'tells' which you have received, type 'tell' with<br>
no arguments.  Tell is used for out of character (ooc) discussions.<br>
<br>
Frequently you will need to share some information or respond to a mob's<br>
query.  For this, see help to and help ask.<br>
