ooc           : lists last ten OOC messages<br>

<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The out of character channel is for discussing ooc concerns, and general<br>
real life things.  It is strongly frowned upon to use the channel in<br>
character.  Requests for items, grouping, etc are not appropriate. <br>
Swearing and other offensive language is unacceptable on this channel as<br>
with the other channels despite the fact that you might be an Ogre in<br>
real as well as in character.  The ooc channel requires one gossip point.<br>
