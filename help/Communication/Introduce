<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
intro [char]  : introduces yourself to [char]<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
 This command allows you to introduce yourself to another player.  From<br>
then on they will see you real name instead of your appearance.  This<br>
mud strongly encourages roleplaying.<br>
<br>
You do NOT have to introduce to a character if you do not want to.  <br>
This feature is to foster a roleplaying environment, and bugging someone<br>
who will not introduce to you is out of line.<br>
