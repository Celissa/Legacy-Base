<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
If you are selling an object to the appropriate store, and the<br>
shopkeeper does already have too many of the object, then the shopkeeper<br>
will pay a set amount of money in exchange for the object.  If you ask<br>
the shopkeeper to value this object before you sell it, you can find<br>
if the shopkeeper will buy it, and if so, how much he will pay.  If<br>
you are skilled in the haggle skill, then this amount can be raised<br>
significantly.<br>
