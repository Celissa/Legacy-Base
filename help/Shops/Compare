<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Compare allows you to compare two items of a similar type and give you a<br>
reasonably accurate judgment on which of the two seems "better" to you. <br>
Note that for the command to work, both items must be unequipped, in your<br>
inventory, and of the same type as one another.<br>
