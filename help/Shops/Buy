buy x*[object]   : purchases x number of that object<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
 If you have enough money, and you are or are above the minimum level,<br>
then you will buy the object from the list.  If you buy x*object, you<br>
will buy x many of that object only if there are that many in stock. <br>
(also see syntax) Buying several of the same object before the shop<br>
has time to restock will cause an increase in that object's price, and<br>
some objects are not useable by certain classes/races.  With the<br>
haggle skill, items can be bought for significantly less money.<br>
