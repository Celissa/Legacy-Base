<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
list        : lists all objects a shopkeeper has to sell <br>
list [item] : lists items matching argument<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
 List gives you a table of all the objects a shopkeeper has, and their<br>
respective costs, levels, number, and condition.  The cost is always<br>
listed in copper pieces, and is based on the value of the object and<br>
how many are in stock.  The level is the minimum level needed to use the<br>
object, and is often low, although the more powerful items tend to have<br>
high levels.<br>
<br>
 The number is the amount of a particular item that the shopkeeper<br>
currently has.  As it varies, the amount that the item is sold for varies<br>
as well; the more items he has, the less they will cost, and the less<br>
items he has, the more they will cost.<br>
<br>
 The condition tells the status of the object.  A shop always sells<br>
items in excellent condition, unless an item in need of repair has<br>
been sold to it by a player.<br>
<br>
 If an argument is specified it uses the same input as buy so it can be<br>
used to verify you are buying what you think you are.  Thus to see a list<br>
of all shields in a shop you would use list all.shield.<br>
<br>
*** in the level portion of the list means that either your race,<br>
class, or alignment forbids your use of the item.<br>
