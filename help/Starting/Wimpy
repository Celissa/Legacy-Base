<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
wimpy                   : list current wimpy settings.<br>
wimpy [field] [% value] : sets your wimpy to a % value of your max hps.<br>
wimpy [field]           : resets the %value of that field to zero.<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Wimpy causes you to flee when your hit points go below your wimpy % value.<br>
You will attempt to flee automatically, so remember to turn it off at the<br>
appropriate times or it could get you into more trouble than whatever good<br>
it may do.  Your maximum wimpy % value depends upon level and your maximum<br>
hit points.  Note that wimpy is NOT failsafe, and comes with no ironclad<br>
guarantees, but it's usually better than nothing.<br>
<br>
The available fields are Flee, Blink, Recall and Pray.  When your hit<br>
points go below the % value of a field, you will attempt to either flee,<br>
recite a scroll of recall if you have one, or cast the spell 'blink' if you<br>
are a mage.  Again, this is not failsafe, so be warned.<br>
