Player Names - Players should choose a name that fits their character<br>
and the medieval time period.  Immortals are encouraged to be lenient in<br>
enforcing this, but characters with blatantly unacceptable names will be<br>
asked to change them.  Examples of unacceptable names are Television,<br>
GoBlue and IamGreat.  In addition to names such as those in the previous<br>
example, names that are blatantly taken from literary, historical and<br>
mythological characters are not allowed.  See Help Names for further<br>
guidelines on this topic.<br>
<br>
Immortal Help - Minor help is allowed for players lower than level 3<br>
such as giving food when starving, giving clues when lost or finding your<br>
corpse in deadly places.  This is to stop the mud from being too<br>
frustrating.  After level 2 no help is allowed except in cases of bugs.<br>
Both players and immortals will be disciplined for this.<br>
<br>
Abusing Bugs - If you find a bug please report it.  Abusing a bug can<br>
ruin the game for everyone and therefore players will be punished for If<br>
it is too good to be true, it probably is, and you had better report it.<br>
<br>
Multi-Playing - Multi-Playing is not allowed.  It gives too much of<br>
an advantage over those who cannot do it.  It also promotes solo'ing and<br>
works against the social structure of the mud.  Multi-players may<br>
reasonably expect themselves to be purged.<br>
<br>
Multiple Accounts - You may only have one account.  If you currently<br>
have more than one please contact an immortal so your accounts can be<br>
consolidated into one.<br>
<br>
Multiple Characters - You are allowed to create multiple characters<br>
provided they are on the same account.  You must not trade equipment<br>
between your own characters, nor assist others in doing so.  You may only<br>
have one character on from at a time.  Playing multiple characters via<br>
multiple accounts is not permitted.<br>
<br>
Local Area Networks (LANs) - You must notify an immortal prior to<br>
logging on multiple characters from the same LAN/IP.  Please provide<br>
information regarding the permanent residents on the network, and if<br>
possible, guests who will log on from time to time at that site.<br>
<br>
5-Minute Rule - A corollary to the rule against multiplaying.  This<br>
rule applies to those players with more than one character.  To switch<br>
playing one character for another, you must wait AT LEAST five minutes<br>
before connecting as the new or 'second' character.<br>
<br>
"Bots" - An integral aspect of mudding is its social dimension. <br>
Bots, or automated scripts, undermine this through the removal of the<br>
human element from the game.  The reduction of the game to a repetitive<br>
series of scripted actions undercuts the roleplaying environment which we<br>
seek to foster at Legacy's Dawning.  As a result, players are not<br>
permitted to run or use bots.  Note: This includes extended periods of<br>
time away from the keyboard and running on triggers.<br>
<br>
Language - We ask that players not curse or use offensive language.<br>
While it is impossible for Immortals to monitor all channels all the<br>
time, we ask that you police yourselves and that you please be sensitive<br>
to your company, both those in the room with you, in the area, and on the<br>
mud as a whole.  Players have complained about this in the past, and<br>
minors do log on here.  Please be considerate to others during your stay<br>
at Legacy's Dawning.<br>
<br>
Revenge and Retribution - If you perceive that your player has been<br>
wronged by another, please contact an immortal before doing anything<br>
silly like trying to get them killed.  No player has the right to ruin<br>
the game for another.  The most severe punishments are reserved for<br>
players who take justice into their own hands and thereby spoil another<br>
person's game.  Discuss the situation with an immortal before taking any<br>
action of this nature.<br>
