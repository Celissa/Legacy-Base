      -  What it would cost (in cp) to learn one skill level of a skill.<br>
      -  What it would cost (in practs) to learn one skill level of a skill.<br>

HOW TO LEARN NEW SKILLS OR IMPROVE EXISTING ONES<br>
<br>
Improving skills through instruction uses up practice points, and costs money.<br>
You receive a certain amount of practice points, in decreasing amounts, every<br>
time you level until you are level 10.  These are 'free' practice points.<br>
For the rest of your life, you only receive practices randomly when you use<br>
your skills or cast spells.  You can also randomly improve a skill level<br>
through real-world experience in using a particular skill/spell.  How smart<br>
you are (intelligence and wisdom) contributes to how often you gain practice<br>
points or improves.<br>
<br>
Some skills will require you to be proficient in a lesser skill before you may<br>
be taught an advanced skill.  (ie:  You must learn to crawl before you can<br>
walk)  Pre-requisites are displayed when examining ability lists.<br>
<br>
To increase your skill level in a particular ability, you must find someone<br>
who teaches that particular ability.  Most teachers can be found in towns,<br>
although some advanced skills might require a quest or task to locate the<br>
teacher or else receive his/her instruction.  Type 'practice' to find out<br>
what someone is capable of teaching you.  If the person teaches the skill you<br>
wish to learn, type 'practice [skill]' to attempt to learn that skill.<br>
