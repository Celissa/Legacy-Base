MULTIPLAYING POLICIES OF Legacy's Dawning:<br>
  <br>
* Multiplaying is not allowed.  It gives too much of an advantage<br>
over those who cannot do it.  It also promotes soloing and works against<br>
the social structure of the MUD.<br>
   <br>
* Players should not trade equipment between their own characters,<br>
nor assist others in doing so.<br>
   <br>
* The Immortals of Legacy's Dawning require that all players wait<br>
five minutes before logging alternate characters on.  In addition, the<br>
immortals ask that players not log in and out frequently in order to<br>
speed up area resets.<br>
   <br>
* Each account may have only one character on at a time, and<br>
playing multiple characters via multiple accounts is also not permitted.<br>
