TOPIC: This helpfile is intended to help those new to Legacy's Dawning get<br>
their feet wet.  Just read Phule's Phive Laws of MUDding before you start<br>
your adventures, and don't forget: have fun!<br>
<br>
Law 1:Self-Preservation.  Set your wimpy.  What wimpy does is<br>
engage character to try to start running away whenever he (or she, of<br>
course) is beaten down to 8 hit points.  Setting your wimpy has Phule's<br>
personal guarantee to save your life at least once, but remember, don't<br>
simply rely on wimpy to get you out of a tight spot.  Fleeing (typing<br>
"flee") will also allow you to protect your tender hide.<br>
<br>
Law 2: Con before kill.  Before you even *think* about attacking a<br>
mob, always try to guage your chances against it.  To do this type "con<br>
monster_name" -- perhaps "con goat" -- and hit enter.  This will make<br>
your character "consider" his/her chance of success against that monster<br>
in a fight.  To start a fight with a monster you come accross, type "kill<br>
monster_name." <br>
<br>
Law 3: Sustenance.  You may have received a message that you were feeling<br>
hungry or thirsty.  Here at Legacy's Dawning you must eat and drink to be<br>
merry.  Water is readily available from city fountains, and many rivers and<br>
brooks also carry cool, refreshing water for your parched lips.  Food can<br>
be a recently fallen apple, or a loaf of bread you can pick up from a<br>
table.  Just type "eat bread" or "drink fountain" to eat and drink.<br>
<br>
Law 4: Clean up your messes.  After you've successfully killed a<br>
monster, you may get more use out if than the simple experience points<br>
you received.  Many corpses, such as those left by rabbits or foxes, can<br>
be skinned to produce valuable pelts or meat.  Just type "skin corpse"<br>
after the fight has ended.<br>
<br>
Law 5: Practice before you preach.  To achieve the best success here<br>
Legacy's Dawning, you need to practice and hone your skills.  For instance,<br>
you'll have to learn to use that shiny new sword before it will do you much<br>
good.  Many shopkeepers and special NPC's (non-player characters) have been<br>
around and might teach you a thing or two.  Just type prac in a room<br>
where you think one of these trainers is.  If you can be taught there, a<br>
list of skills will appear.  Type prac skill_name to train in that skill.<br>
Type Abil s, abil p or abil w to see a list of your abilities you can<br>
learn.<br>
<br>
I hope this helpfile will be of assistance to those of you who need it. <br>
Happy MUDding!!<br>
