Zone/Area Stealing - Players should respect others on the game.  If<br>
you enter a new area and see another person or group there, please check<br>
with them to make sure there is room enough in the zone for you. <br>
Overrunning an area, or stealing it, is not permitted.  You will be<br>
warned for the first infraction and further trespasses will warrant<br>
penalties, including reduced experience points, level setback, or banning. <br>
If you feel someone has stolen a zone from you, please contact an<br>
immortal.<br>
<br>
Player Killing (PK) - is not allowed.  If you want to duel with<br>
another player, please go to an arena.  If you try to get someone killed<br>
(for example summoning them into an agressive area, walking them into a<br>
big mob and then fleeing, etc), then you can rightly expect to be banned. <br>
If you find a bug which results in the accidental death of a player you<br>
must contact an immortal immediately so it can be fixed.<br>
<br>
Reimbs - Reimbursements may be given in some cases for losses due to<br>
major bugs.  The normal reimbursement is the equipment you had as of the<br>
last backup of the player files.  This may not be all that you lost but<br>
eliminates the problem of lying so no other equipment reimbursement will<br>
be given.  Deaths or losses due to lag are not eligible for<br>
reimbursements.  Items lost in a crash are not eligible for reimbursement<br>
unless they were lost on a corpse.  Reimbursements of experience due to<br>
death will not be given without a full log of the incident.<br>
<br>
Powerleveling - Another integral aspect of Legacy's Dawning is<br>
earning your levels.  This requires honest work on your part, and can<br>
sometimes be difficult.  We discourage powerleveling in all forms.  This<br>
includes: following people around ungrouped to gain more experience<br>
points, having the group leader (or "tank") turn his/her parry option on<br>
so the followers get un-diminished experience points, or having a cleric<br>
pump constant heals to you in an area significantly higher than your<br>
level allows for.  Possible consequences of powerleveling include<br>
warnings, reduction of your level or experience points, and repeated<br>
offences may warrant severe action such as banning or removal of that<br>
character from the game.  Powerleveling ruins the game for many people,<br>
dramatically lowers an area's experience point potential, and hinders the<br>
social aspect of our game.  If you aren't sure that a particular group or<br>
area is considered powerleveling, please ask an immortal with the<br>
"request" command.<br>
<br>
Parental Supervision - Due to the violence and themes in this game,<br>
we require the following levels of parental supervision: <br>
<br>
Ages 0 to 7: Constant parental supervision.  This child may not mud unless<br>
an adult is supervising at all times.  The supervising adult may not have<br>
their character on at the same time (penalty multiplaying).<br>
<br>
Ages 8 to 11: Partial parental supervision.  This child may not mud<br>
unless an adult is present at all times.  The supervising adult may play<br>
at the same time, from a different computer only.<br>
<br>
Ages 12 to 17: Parental guidance.  This child may not mud unless the<br>
parent knows and gives permission to play.<br>
<br>
Ages 18+: You may MUD.  Be sure to keep within the rules as stated in the<br>
policies, policies2 and policies3 help files.<br>
