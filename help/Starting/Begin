Welcome to Legacy's Dawning. This is a quick-start file designed to<br>
help you get going as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
You will start in one of two main towns.  If you are a member of the evil<br>
races (orcs, gobins, ogres, trolls, or vyans) you will begin in the evil<br>
town of Voaleth.  All other race types start in the good town of<br>
Chiiron.  It is probably in your best interests to stay close to town<br>
until you get a feel for the mud.  You may get a map of your settlement<br>
by typing 'help Voaleth' or 'help Chiiron' respectively.  It is a good<br>
idea to wander about town and learn your way around.  Go into shops and<br>
type 'list' to see what each sells, 'custom' to see if the shop offers to<br>
make any custom-made items, and 'practice' to see what skills you may<br>
practice in a location.  It is not wise to kill shopkeepers, start with<br>
rabbits and frogs outside of Chiiron or screech bats and homonculus in<br>
the caves east of Voaleth and work your way up from there.  There is a<br>
being in each starting town who will answer many questions posed to it. <br>
In Chiiron it is the weary elf, in Voaleth the aged troll - a good way to<br>
start is by going up to it and typing 'ask elf advice' or 'ask<br>
troll advice' as the case may be.  Conversations with most NPCs can<br>
also be initiated with by typing 'to [mobname] hi'.  To get help<br>
on a topic, type help [keyword].  You might also want to try out the<br>
index, which you can begin using by simply typing index and<br>
following the instructions.<br>
<br>
For starting XP in Chiiron, try killing the frogs north of town or the<br>
rabbits outside the west and east gates near town.  If you are starting<br>
in Voaleth seek out the tunnel worms east of town or the screech bats<br>
north and east of town.  Remember to use the consider command before<br>
you attack a mob - this can tell you, very roughly, how tough a mob is to<br>
fight.<br>
<br>
Some mobs, such as rabbits and screech bats, may be skinned.  You may<br>
then sell their skins to raise money.  (See help skin).<br>
<br>
Important commands which you should learn to check frequently are<br>
score, inventory, leech, identity,  and reputation.<br>
<br>
To learn how custom items work, check out help custom.<br>
<br>
For information on skills, type help abilities.<br>
<br>
Other useful files which you might wish to read include help newbie<br>
and help starting.  If you are a member of class that casts spells,<br>
read help leech and help prepare.<br>
<br>
Before you reach level 5, you will need to get your character<br>
approved. See help approvals and follow the directions therein<br>
when you get the opportunity.<br>
<br>
The global/public channels here are chat, gossip, ooc<br>
(out-of-character), and auction.  Immortals generally only listen to<br>
gossip.  If you have a question, feel free to ask for help on chat - the<br>
other players will be very friendly if you identify yourself as a newbie.<br>
<br>
To learn more about mud policies, type help policies.<br>
<br>
When you get a chance, type "reputation" to learn why you shouldn't<br>
attack shopkeepers or guards - people remember you and your past deeds.<br>
