Newbie Help<br>
------ ----<br>
<br>
Welcome to Legacy's Dawning!<br>
<br>
This is intended to help you get started in your adventures here.  This<br>
MUD is different from many other MUDs around in many respects.  <br>
<br>
Some of our features:<br>
*We strongly encourage a roleplaying environment.<br>
*We have actions, object programs, and mob programs; these programs<br>
allow the builders to make anything from intelligent weapons and mobs to<br>
gates that open when you knock or pull a lever.<br>
*Our OLC system allows us to update, repair and build areas anytime.<br>
*We have many features not found on other muds, many new commands. <br>
Reading the helpfile is a must.<br>
