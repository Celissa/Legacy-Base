<br>
Immortal Players - Immortals are allowed to play mortals so long as<br>
they do not pkill or give out excessive amounts of equipment.  Immortals<br>
should also keep the identity of their mortals secret from other players. <br>
Also immortal players MUST NOT have modified stats or be aided by the<br>
immortal in anyway.<br>
<br>
Equipment Swapping - Passing equipment between two or more of a<br>
player's characters is illegal.<br>
<br>
Repop - Losing link or quitting out to speed repop is illegal.  The<br>
only way to legally speed up repop is to leave the zone.<br>
<br>

frustrating.  Areas will not contain 'automatic death' traps.<br>
