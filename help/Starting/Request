<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
request              : lists pending requests - Imm only command<br>
request imm [reason] : requests an imm<br>
request ava [reason] : requests an avatar<br>
request cancel       : cancel all requests by you<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
This command is for mortals to request the attention of an avatar or<br>
immortal.  Please make your reasons as precise as possible.  In simple<br>
cases hopefully removing any need for conversation.<br>
<br>
PLEASE: When using request don't type "request immortal I have a<br>
question" Type in the question.<br>
<br>
When an immortal has helped you please type request cancel to clear it.<br>
<br>
When using this command, asking the question in the request is a good<br>
idea.  i.e.  request imm the goblin spearman is blinding himself is far<br>
better than: request imm problem with mob <br>
<br>
Examples of BAD Requests:<br>
I found a bug!<br>
I lost my corpse in a crash!<br>
