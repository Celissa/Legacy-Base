<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
appearance [text] : sets your appearance<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Characters that you have never met before are described by their physical<br>
appearance.  Only after a player introduces himself or herself to you<br>
will you see that player's name.  This appearance is set by the player. <br>
The commands to do so are appearance and keywords.<br>
<br>
Appearances do NOT start with "a" or "an." The game puts this in<br>
for you. You do not need a "." at the end either.<br>
Appearances must be less than 50 characters in length.<br>
<br>
Your appearance should show those physical characteristics that another<br>
person would first notice when looking at you.  It should not show<br>
emotion or how someone might react to your appearance.  Avoid words that<br>
would be assumed for your race already, i.e.  short, stocky dwarf or<br>
tall, thin vyan.  Appearances should also not include actions such as<br>
hiding (a thief skill) or things that assume how you are clothed.<br>
<br>
DO NOT PUT YOUR CLASS IN YOUR APPEARANCE!<br>
Your race SHOULD be included (disguises do not, as such, exist right now,<br>
so appearances such as 'mysterious figure cloaked in darkest samite' are<br>
not acceptable.) <br>
References to your race should not be capitalized.  And if you wish to<br>
use a number in your appearance, please spell it out.<br>
<br>
Your keywords should include every word from your appearance, including<br>
race, separated by spaces, not commas.<br>
<br>
Slang such as "buff, ripped, butch, cool, etc" is not acceptable and will<br>
not be approved.<br>
<br>
Lastly, you need to set a description.  This is done with the command<br>
description.  After you have set appearance, keywords and<br>
description, type: request avatar approval or request immortal<br>
approval for someone to approve you.<br>
Sometimes, usually very late at night or early morning, there might not<br>
be any avatars or immortals online.  In this case, you will have to wait<br>
for one to log online.<br>
<br>
It is mandatory that you be approved to advance to level 6.<br>
There are a great many players these days, and it is a good idea to try<br>
to come up with keywords, and a part of your appearance that are unique.<br>
<br>
Examples of unacceptable appearances:<br>
  Jedi Knight<br>
  mysterious figure<br>
  two-headed Chaos Troll, crackling with eldrich energy<br>
  tall, dark, thin vyan<br>
  tall elf radiating a bright aura of goodness<br>
  short, stock dwarf with a beard<br>
  short green guy<br>
  15 foot tall Ogre picking his teeth<br>
<br>

  warty, slack-jawed troll covered in tribal scars<br>
