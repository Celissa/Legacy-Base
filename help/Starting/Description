<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
description [line of your description] :<br>
                      sets a line of your description<br>
   This command uses the standard editor - see help editor for a list<br>
   and description of how to write a description for yourself.<br>
   NOTE: Description does not use many of the commands that are unique<br>
   to note and mail, such as send, post, and delete.<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Using the description command, you can write a block of text describing<br>
your character's physical characteristics.  It is displayed either when<br>
someone looks at you, or uses the qlook command.  Your description should<br>
include what your character looks like as well as any other information you<br>
feel someone could gather from your appearance.<br>
<br>
It should not include emotions or anything which another player could not<br>
realistically gather from merely looking at you.<br>
<br>
Please note that a description is generally at least one paragraph of at<br>
least a half-dozen or so sentences in length.  Writing your description,<br>
appearance and keywords is mandatory for advancing beyond the fifth level<br>
of experience.<br>
<br>
GUIDELINES<br>
<br>
* Should be at least five complete sentences.<br>
* The same rules as to what doesn't go for appearance applies here as<br>
       well. No auras, abnormal things like two-heads, etc.<br>
* Do not include your name or class in your description.<br>
* Do NOT force the judgment of the viewer, i.e. "You become afraid,"<br>
    "you get hungry just looking at...," you want to beat his head in."<br>
* Do NOT include actions, i.e., "As you watch, his hair turns pink," "He<br>
    grabs a tree and uproots it."<br>
* Do NOT include clothing or other removeable objects.  Tattoos, items<br>
    braided into hair/beard, and scars are fine, though.<br>
* Do NOT capitalize race in your description or appearance.<br>
* DO include things such as eyecolor, hair color, height,<br>
    race (flaunt those elf ears and troll warts), and other physical<br>
    characteristics.<br>
* DO spell out words for numbers instead of using digits, i.e.  ten<br>
    instead of 10.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Long, lean muscles cover a body without a trace of extraneous fat.  The<br>
pale lavender skin is unblemished and unlined, not an imperfection<br>
showing anywhere.  Pure white hair, with not a trace of gray, is pulled<br>
back away from the bony face, and flows in orderly waves just past this<br>
vyan's shoulders.  A small braid of white, twined with a dark, amethyst<br>
ribbon, falls over high cheekbones and down the right side of the face<br>
and neck.  Pure white brows soar archedly over light purple eyes ringed<br>
with the deepest midnight blue.  The svelte figure has very few curves,<br>
just barely enough to indicate that this vyan is female.<br>
