When you are overcome in battle and you die, your soul is taken to the<br>
paths of death.  Death, in his infinite wisdom, will grant you another<br>
chance to achieve your life's goals at the small price of 1/4 of your<br>
life's experience.  However, when you are returned to the realms, you are<br>
