Getting Started <br>
------- -------<br>
<br>
Make sure your name is suitable for the theme of this game!  If you<br>
are unsure ask a god.  <br>
<br>
1.Create a description for your character telling as much as you can<br>
about them; what they look like and how they act are good starters.(See<br>
help description for how to write your description.) <br>
2.Explore your starting town, look for shopkeepers and trainers. <br>
    Attacking members of your clan will get you kicked out of your clan<br>
    *Don't attack shopkeepers or other townspeople, they are often clan<br>
    members.<br>
3.Go to the local shops and equip yourself with armor and a weapon. <br>
Be sure to save some copper for practicing your skills.<br>
4.Find some trainers and practice the skills you want.<br>
5.Adventure to a very low level area and kill for xp, be sure to<br>
consider everything before killing it.  For characters in clan<br>
Secomber north of Chiiron is good and the beach a ways to the east of<br>
Chiiron is also good.  <br>
6.After gaining level two, return to town and practice more skills<br>
with your newly gained practice points.  Also be sure to sell any skins<br>
you aquire. <br>
7.Repeat the process until you are ready to adventure and Role<br>
Play.  And most of all...Have Fun!!! <br>
8.Be sure to find an use the banking system.  It's very nice to have<br>
funds in the bank if you die and are unable to retrieve your stuff. <br>
Banks can be found in all major towns and are linked via the fastest<br>
carrier pidgeon service in the know world.  <br>
