This mud expects a syntax of input slightly different than most muds, which<br>
can be confusing at first.  There are special characters that must be used<br>
in conjunction with certain commands to either distinguish between items<br>
with similar names, or do an action to multiple items.<br>
<br>
There are many objects in the mud that have almost identical names.  For<br>
example, if you have a short sword and a long sword in your inventory,<br>
typing 'look sword' might not look at the correct sword.  To look<br>
specifically at the long sword, you would put a period in between the words<br>
of the object's name.  So, 'look long.sword' would look at the long sword.<br>
If you wanted to buy a soft leather jacket and not a hard leather jacket,<br>
you would type 'buy soft.leather.jacket'.<br>
<br>
Often, you will want to do something with many of the same type of item.<br>
To get, give, drop, sell, or buy many of the same type of item, you would<br>
use the '*' character in front of the object's name, in the form<br>
x*[object], x being the number of that object.  For example, to drop 10<br>
copper pieces, you would type 'drop 10*copper'.  To buy 3 wooden shields,<br>
you would type 'buy 3*wooden.shield'.<br>
<br>
The prefix 'all' is also used.  To sell all the skins in your inventory,<br>
you would type 'sell all.skin'.  HOWEVER, 'all' can be used in two ways.<br>
To get all the objects from your bag, you would type 'get all bag'.  But,<br>
to get all the bags in the room, you would type 'get all.bag'.<br>
