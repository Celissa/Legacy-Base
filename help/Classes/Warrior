Warriors are skilled in the art of war.  Usually having dismal mental<br>
abilities, warriors cannot cast spells of any type, and hence believe<br>
almost solely in brute force.  At a young age, they learn how to kick,<br>
bash, parry, and use a shield more effectively.  From there, warriors gain<br>
the important skills of rescue, guard, and multiple attacks up to five.<br>
Warriors are the only class able to learn Berserk and Frenzy, and due to<br>
their superior combat abilities are the underpinning of ANY successful<br>
group.<br>
