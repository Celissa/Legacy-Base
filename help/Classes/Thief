Thieves are the dregs of society, never having learned how to make an<br>
honest living.  They have a complete disregard of personal property,<br>
sneaking around, peeking here and there, picking locks to break in and<br>
enter, and stealing anything that may be of any use or worth.  The<br>
ability to spot traps and disarm them, coupled with their ability to<br>
sneak, and hide, make thieves notoriously difficult to find or<br>
detect.  Should the opportunity arise, or should the situation require, a<br>
thief will never hesitate to plunge a dagger into a foe's back.  After<br>
all, as one famous thief was heard to say, "It does not matter how subtle<br>
the wizard, a dagger in the back will cramp his style." <br>
