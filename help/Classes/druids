Druids are the guardians of nature and are bestowed with gifts of magic<br>
to enable them to protect their habitat.  Typically a druid will pick one<br>
area and protect it from outside hazards, however, younger druids are<br>
known to wander the land learning what they can from all the different<br>
habitats they can observe before settling down.  All druids are at home<br>
with nature and find civilization to be somewhat unsettling as most<br>
civilized races must coerce the land and its nature to make it<br>
"civilized".  Druids are in many ways similar to rangers in their love of<br>
nature and the abilities given them.  Where a ranger can be said to be<br>
the physical warrior of nature the druid is gifted more strongly in the<br>
way of magic.  Druidic spells are primarily concerned with effects found<br>
in nature.  After studying the ways of plants and animals a druid can<br>
learn to shape change into many of the life forms they come into contact<br>
with.  Druids are also given some ability to repair the wounds of the<br>
world and heal wounds.  Druids will not use bladed weapons since bladed<br>
weapons are one of the greatest threats to a forest's growth and well<br>
being.  They also typically avoid the use of metal armor as it both<br>
 requires significant damage to unearth most times and interferes with<br>
their magics.  The lesser amount of metals in such weapons as mace heads<br>
and hammer heads are considered a tolerable cost to accept in lieu of<br>
their ability to safely wield in defending the woods.<br>
