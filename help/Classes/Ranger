Rangers are outdoorsmen and wandering types who operate beyond the<br>
boundaries of society.  They feel at home with nature, and do not remain<br>
for long in civilized parts, preferring instead to spend their days<br>
surrounded by nature.<br>
<br>
Due to this self-reliant streak, Rangers have a wide variety of skills<br>
available to them, including a number of useful spells and several unique<br>
abilities which relate to their experience with and knowledge of the<br>
natural world.  Among these are the skills Track and an improved version of<br>
Scan, which makes a ranger an invaluable scout and ally of any group, and<br>
the spell Tame, through which a ranger may befriend an animal encountered<br>
in the wild.<br>
<br>
Rangers make strong fighters, and while they do not have as wide a<br>
selection of armor and weapons as fighters and paladins, they can deal<br>
damage extremely well and stand in the front rank as a substitute when<br>
necessary.<br>
<br>
