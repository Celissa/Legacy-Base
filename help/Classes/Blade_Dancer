The warrior mystics of Khephera have walked the earth in their quest for<br>
mastery over song, dance and combat for many years.  However, only since<br>
the discovery of the new continent have their teachings been made<br>
available to those who wish to dedicate them selves to the way of<br>
neutrality and the arts of Khephera.  Neophytes of the order learn the<br>
way of flowing warfare, enabling them to strike and fade with skills<br>
greater than any other warrior.  The power of Khephera allows them to<br>
channel song and dance into mystical forms, transforming a mundane skill<br>
into a divine art.  The way of the blade dancer is an exacting path, one<br>
that requires great nimbleness and intuition coupled with a sharp whit<br>
and hardy disposition.<br>
<br>
Because of the need for free movement, Blade dancers are unable to wear<br>
leather or heavier armor.  Blades perform their skills with the Dance<br>
and Sing commands.<br>
