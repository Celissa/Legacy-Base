Encased in darkness and despair, the sorcerer applies death and<br>
destruction to the world, spreading hate, fear and death like a plague<br>
across the light lands.  Empowered by the dark gods and elder demons,<br>
they attack the mind, body and soul of those unfortunate enough to cross<br>
them.  Distaining combat abilities, they focus instead on furthering<br>
their black arts, drawing them closer to the demonic forces upon which<br>
they call.  In their final hours upon the world, some have been able to<br>
transform into an undead mage, enabling them to continue their evil works<br>
in the form of an arch lich.<br>
<br>
Although often beautiful, the new continent holds a dark secret, a sect of<br>
evil creatures who have delved into the dark teachings of the unholy three,<br>
and in dedicating their lives to them, have gained the powerful magics from<br>
beyond the grave.  Sorcerers can only begin in the new world, where the<br>
teachings have been hidden until the discovery.  The township of Tar'ippal<br>
still holds one of their lesser masters.  Seek that one out for assistance<br>
in stepping onto this darkest of paths.<br>
