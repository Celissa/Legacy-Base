Clerics are devotees to a god or religion, and their piety brings them much<br>
reward.  Channeling the power of a deity through themselves, clerics have<br>
the ability to perform miracles of the curative and protective type.  Other<br>
powerful spells learned by these magic users do include harmful ones, as<br>
they can bring down a god's holy wrath upon a foe with harm and slay<br>
spells.<br>
<br>
With these spells alone, a cleric is a useful addition to a group, but with<br>
the added spells of the creation type and the special protect life spell,<br>
Clerics become a unique and powerful class required by all in any<br>
successful endeavor.<br>
<br>
Clerics may not use weapons which shed blood due to religious vows, but<br>
nonetheless manage to have a wide selection of weapons and armor available<br>
to them.<br>
<br>
For a listing of the spells and abilities available to Clerics, please see<br>
the help file on Abilities.  Other help files that may be useful include<br>
spell, magic, and leech.<br>
