Monks are extremely deadly fighters specializing in unarmed combat.  As<br>
Legacy's Dawning is not set in an Asian-type setting, monks are not<br>
necessarily analogous to 'traditional' monks, but instead represent<br>
experts at individual, unarmed combat.  Included in their plethora of<br>
physical abilities are the skills of tiger paw, dragon strike,<br>
and critical hit, which multiply the damage done on a strike.  Higher<br>
level monks attain the abilities of death strike, and demon slash. <br>
Unable to use armor better than that made from leather, monks rely upon<br>
defensive skills such as dodge, parry, and shadow dance to<br>
provide them with protection.  While very weak at lower levels, monks are<br>
indispensible to any group seeking to battle any powerful foe, because<br>
their ability to inflict massive damage is required for victorious combat.<br>

Monks, please see the help file on Abilities.<br>
