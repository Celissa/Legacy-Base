In the beginning, temples were easy targets, so they hired warriors and<br>
fighters to protect them.  Over time, these temple protectors not only<br>
came to practice their arts of war, but also became devout to the<br>
temple's god.  In this way, they became the strong arm of the church,<br>
where their unique combination of skills were needed.  Hence, the Paladin<br>
was born. Because of their devotion to a god, paladins gain a wide<br>
assortment of simple spells.  Useful spells such as create light, food,<br>
water and other curative spells are complimented by the more powerful<br>
spell of remove curse.  However, gaining these benefits cost these<br>
paladins to lose some of their formidable warrior skills.  They cannot<br>
hit quite as often as true warriors, but they learn the powerful skills<br>
of turn undead and lay hands.  This mixture of spells and skills<br>
make Paladins a very powerful class, one that relies less on others for<br>
survival in a harsh world.<br>
