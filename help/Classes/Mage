A mage is an individual whose intellectual curiosity leads him to ask<br>
questions perhaps better left unconsidered.  Mages typically possess<br>
tremendous mental abilities, and spend a great deal of time in research and<br>
in conducting their experiments.  This generally leaves them with feeble<br>
physical skills.  From their magical training, they learn the mystical<br>
nature of the world around them, and having learned how to shape this<br>
force, they bend the physical world around them to suit their whim and<br>
will.<br>
<br>
While mages tend to start slowly, they are important to any group because<br>
they have such diverse effects.  Simple spells can create water, food, and<br>
light, while more powerful spells can harness natural forces into bolts of<br>
lightning and sheets of fire.  Protective spells, detection spells, and<br>
spells to enhance physical abilities are all learned by a mage, and with<br>
the additional unique and extremely useful spell of find familiar, a mage<br>
is indeed a powerful class.  Mages' spells are adversely affected by metal,<br>
and the more metal a mage wears the more difficult it is to cast spells.<br>
