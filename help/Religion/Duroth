Duroth of the Forge - God of the Earth and all that lies beneath.<br>
<br>
Deep within the fires of the towering mountains burns a raging heat so<br>
intense, yet so pure, that metals succumb so easily to the mouldings of<br>
those who work with the various ore found here.  Items created in this<br>
brutal area are flawless in every detail; tarnish and rust cannot touch<br>
the fabric of metal forged here.  No mortal has ever been able to<br>
withstand the legendary flames; however, there is one being who makes<br>
this inhospitable environment his foundry.  His enemies are many,<br>
consisting mostly of the orcs and ogres that make up the followers of<br>
Ragezer, a god of evil who claims the earth as his domain alone.<br>
<br>
Duroth of the Forge as his followers know him, is the god of the earth<br>
itself, the mountains, and all of the land and caverns beneath.  Being<br>
such, he knows of all minerals and gem veins in the earth's depths, and<br>
forging weapons, armour, and jewellery items of high qualities are all<br>
highly important to him.  Also important to an extent, though somewhat<br>
more so to the boisterous dwarves, who make up the brunt of his<br>
followers, is the small matter of brewing through cracks in the rocks and<br>
caves that make up their underground homes.  Such alcohol usually has a<br>
very gritty and strong taste, the 'holy water' of his priests.<br>
<br>
Other than the dwarves, some gnomish tribes, which dwell below the earth<br>
have an inclination to follow Duroth, and can be almost as skilled at his<br>
crafts.  Many members of other races with a more 'earthy' feel also<br>
follow his ways.  Beyond that, he is not worshipped by many who do not<br>
have a strong interest in the earth, gemstones, or the art of forging,<br>
though all those with a taste in fine and strong drinks at least know his<br>
name to have someone to toast for the next round.  When he appears to his<br>
followers, it is said to be as an old but fit dwarf who sports an unruly<br>
and singed white beard, balding head, and carries a forging hammer (and<br>
sometimes a pick) of a strong, silvery metal and a fine suit of mail to<br>
match, or alternatively, as a mighty earth elemental.  His symbol is the<br>
aforementioned hammer, smashing against an anvil and scattering white-hot<br>
sparks in a wide radius.<br>
