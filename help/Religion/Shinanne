Shinanne - Goddess of Feasts and Harvests.<br>
<br>
The goddess Shinanne is the Goddess of feasts and harvests, and as such a<br>
shrine to her will be found in most settlements of at least a villages<br>
size, to bless their crops and make them bountiful.  She cherishes life<br>
dearly, and it is for this reason that she holds festivals - in order to<br>
remind the more serious that life is to be enjoyed.  This attitude holds<br>
her in great stead with the halfling people, for they are gourmet diners<br>
and love the simple pleasures of life, food, wine, and parties.  While<br>
all other races recognize her importance for harvests, few members of<br>
them worship her as greatly and above others as the halflings.  Those who<br>
worship Shinanne often pay tribute in the form of freshly baked tarts and<br>
pastries or other food at her temples.<br>
<br>
Because of her opinions towards an easy-going life, her and her followers<br>
are often seen as lazy, but generally this is merely confused with an<br>
easy-going, carefree style of life.  When it comes down to it, her<br>
followers fight courageously against those who would seek to disrupt such<br>
a life, especially the followers of Ghnomb, whose slavering trolls seek<br>
to devour their harvests and destroy all that they have worked hard to<br>
create.  Indeed, sometimes their regiments are ignored on the<br>
battlefields in lieu of more obvious threats, only to become the deciding<br>
factor.<br>
<br>
Shinanne is said to often visit her followers, though seldom in a form<br>
that they might recognize, preferring her anonymity.  When she does<br>
appear visibly, she is said to resemble a rosy-cheeked matronly halfling<br>
woman, with short braids tucked over her shoulders and wearing a<br>
flour-stained apron.  In this form she often carries a rolling pin,<br>
carving knife, or heavy skillet, which she wields with deadly accuracy. <br>
Her symbol is similar to that of many inns and taverns, where her<br>
followers can be found enjoying a fine meal, that of a loaf of<br>
fresh-baked bread beside a mug of frothing ale.<br>
