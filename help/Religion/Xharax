Xharax - God of the Undead and Demons.<br>
<br>
Xharax, called the accursed, has very few mortal followers, as he tends to<br>
rarely listen to any prayers of assistance from the mortal realms.  His<br>
attention appears to be placed on other more vile regions where his minions<br>
reign supreme.  He has however, realized the knowledge and strength that<br>
such followers provide, and has begun teaching them the black arts.  Most<br>
of his worshippers are necromancers, who seek to use dark magics to raise<br>
the dead and summon demons, for their own personal power, and that of<br>
Xharax himself.<br>
<br>
His temples are well hidden, and most people will live their entire lives<br>
never hearing of, let alone seeing one.  Rumour has it that one must abound<br>
on a deadly quest, from which many never return.  His brothers, Taraskatt<br>
and Khalmor, make up the threesome that is the Ebon Triumvirate, though<br>
only their followers know how loyal each is to the rest of the trio at any<br>
point in time.  His greatest enemies are the gods of justice, life, and<br>
white magic, Chandros, Halina, and Tairae, but he has a special hatred in<br>
his black heart for Tairae, the opposite in his spell casting viewpoints.<br>
<br>
When he comes before those chosen few who are in his service, Xharax is<br>
known only to appear as a shadowed man with eyes of molten lava, bearing a<br>
huge pair of demonic wings on his back.  His insignia to all who know him<br>
is a burning skull on a field of midnight black, depicting the pain and<br>
desolation that his undead and demonic creatures are capable of inflicting.<br>
