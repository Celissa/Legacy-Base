Khephera - Goddess of Song, dance and spirits of air.<br>
<br>
Wherever a woodlark lifts its voice in sweet song, wherever a child<br>
dances to a tune heard in the chaos of her mind, wherever a merry breeze<br>
skips to the lyrical melody of the seasons, there is Khephera.  The Lady<br>
of Music, patronized by many bards and lovers of fine song, is a<br>
capricious deity, her actions often seeming as random as the notes of a<br>
melody, or the dance of the wind through the treetops.  Her followers are<br>
a merry lot, eternally dancing through the endless song of life and death<br>
woven throughout the ages.  Detractors of her religion call the devotees<br>
of Khephera vain and hedonistic, too caught up in their melodies to take<br>
notice of the world around them, though the songsters seem not to care,<br>
preferring instead to turn to their own labyrinth of music.<br>
<br>
Khephera's worshippers are a very diverse lot, not restricted to any<br>
particular race.  Music-lovers are found among both the light and the<br>
dark races, and as such, Khephera's followers are many.  Most of her<br>
priesthood are skilled with at least one instrument, and many are adept<br>
at playing several, ranging from lyres and lutes to panpipes and<br>
percussion instruments.  Khephera has no true enemies; those that invoke<br>
her wrath usually find themselves the victim of some cruel (albeit<br>
accurate) satire, and hastily repent their wrongs against her.  Most<br>
bards and minstrels credit the Lady of Music as the inspiration for their<br>
works, and she is said to patronize any gathering where song, dance and<br>
gaiety are prevalent.<br>
<br>
Khephera takes a very active role in the mortal world, appearing often to<br>
her followers.  Their descriptions of her are as varied as the colours of<br>
the sunset, as each individual tends to see that which is most beautiful<br>
in his or her eyes.  The most consistent of her appearances is a pale<br>
human beauty, with hair black as a raven's wing.  Her eyes, no matter<br>
what the rest of her manifestation may look like, remain always the same;<br>
lacking both white and pupil, they appear to be merely fields of stars on<br>
a velvet black sky.  Khephera's symbol is that of a silver poet's lyre, a<br>
single red rose entwined among its gilded strings.  Anywhere the wind<br>
goes, there she is, for her fingers are the wind, and the wind her<br>
fingers, while all space is the smile of her.<br>
