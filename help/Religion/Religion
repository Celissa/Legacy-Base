This helpfile is a summary of the basic religions of the realm.  For<br>
those who used to play this game in the past, you will notice a lot of<br>
changes; a whole new pantheon of gods.  Some may bear similarities to<br>
some of the 'old gods', these are merely for familiarity's purposes.  For<br>
details on the reasons for the changes, please read [help creation].<br>
<br>
Because of these differences in the gods, and the new importance religion<br>
has, read carefully through the help files of the different gods before<br>
making your decision as to who you might worship, if anyone.  Note that<br>
priests, paladins, and monks must choose a specific religion prior to<br>
level 5.  Note that none of the gods cater specifically towards certain<br>
races or classes, though many may have large bases made up of their<br>
followers due to the gods and followers matches in ideologies.<br>
