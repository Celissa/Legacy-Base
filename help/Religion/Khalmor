Khalmor - God of the Dead.<br>
<br>
Reigning supreme in the black depths of the Abyss, Khalmor is the god of<br>
the dead.  Though simply sending both good and evil souls to their<br>
rightful places in the afterlife is not an evil act in its own, what<br>
makes Khalmor evil is his recent trend towards wanting to increase the<br>
influx of souls entering his domain.  In doing such, the Ebon Triumvirate<br>
of himself, Taraskatt, and Xharax have done much in attempts to bring<br>
death and war to the lands.<br>
<br>
His personal tasks of sending each soul to its rightful place is always<br>
done perfectly, he sends no soul to a place other than where it truly<br>
deserves to be.  He does, however, seek to reign over more souls.  The<br>
greatest servants in his quest to these ends are the holy crusaders of<br>
darkness, whose strength and courage help him defeat his foes.  His<br>
greatest enemies, of course, are the equally chivalrous followers of<br>
Chandros.  Their diametrical struggle between holy and unholy might is<br>
one that shall not be resolved without battle to the death, in which<br>
case, no matter who the victor is, Khalmor has claimed more souls in his<br>
domain.<br>
<br>
When Khalmor appears it is often as a living pillar of unholy fire,<br>
radiating an aura of fear to all that see him.  His other main form is<br>
that of a warrior in spiked armour, completely blackened by fire with<br>
burning red eyes that are the only indication that anything lives inside<br>
the suit.  The crest on the warriors shield is that of an inverted sun,<br>
completely black, sinking into a sea of blood, a cruel mockery of the<br>
symbol of Chandros.  This also serves to be his personal symbol, a<br>
constant mark against Chandros' pride.<br>
