sacrifice [item] to [deity]<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
This command has many uses, the most important use is choosing a religion. <br>
Once you have found a god to worship, you merely sacrifice an item of<br>
value to that deity to bring about his/her attention.  Sometimes an item<br>
will cling to you, and you just can't find a way to get rid of it.  Going<br>
to a holy, or unholy altar, and using this command to directly request<br>
the power of your diety sometimes works in destroying the item.<br>
