Iniara - Goddess of Pain and Revenge, Mother of Darkness.<br>
<br>
The brilliance of light must always be balanced by the black of night,<br>
and within this darkness, seething shadows lie in wait.  This realm of<br>
seductive shadows is the favoured abode of Iniara, the Queen of Pain. <br>
Known to her children, predominantly members of the Vyan race, as the<br>
Dark Mother, Iniara is revered as the matriarch of pain and suffering,<br>
and indeed, many of her Priestesses (for few males ever rise to positions<br>
of high power in her service) bear the marks of ritual scarring all over<br>
their bodies.  Iniara's followers tend to be those who seek to learn from<br>
the moments of ecstasy found only at the height of the most exquisite<br>
pain, and as such, tend to seek out many wild experiences to gather the<br>
wisdom and insights that they can learn from these exotic sensations.<br>
<br>
Iniara's devotees are feared by many, both by those who walk in sunlight<br>
and by those following the call of the shadows, as the wild revels held<br>
by her worshippers rarely end without the sacrifice of some intelligent<br>
being, usually by the most exquisitely painful (and therefore the most<br>
spiritually enlightening) method possible.  The elves in particular are<br>
seen as anathema, and are favoured victims for the sacrificial rituals,<br>
as the Vyans find it amusing to see just how much pain they can inflict<br>
upon the fragile elf before it succumbs to the dark embrace of Khalmor. <br>
Followers of the Dark Mother seek to wreak their revenge upon anything<br>
and everything that they feel has done them wrong, sometimes merely on<br>
the slightest of whims.<br>
<br>
Those among her priesthood who have seen manifestations of Iniara claim<br>
she appears as either a darkly beautiful temptress of the Vyan race, with<br>
cold skin the colour of obsidian and eyes the translucent grey of morning<br>
mist, clad mainly in her long, silvery curls, or as an equally beautiful<br>
Vyan matron, heavily pregnant, bearing the ritual scars, brands and<br>
tattoos of a high priestess all over her body.  Even those Vyans who<br>
patronize deities other than she hold a place in their heart for this<br>
Queen of Pain, whom all recognize as the mother of their race.  Her<br>
symbol is a vicious looking scourge, wreathed in flames, with a single<br>
drop of blood dangling from one wickedly barbed lash.<br>
