Halina - Goddess of Charity and Life.<br>
<br>
Halina is known among those of good heart as being the matron mother of<br>
all races.  She is known as the "Celestial Midwife" or the Goddess of<br>
Charity and Life, with the birth of new life being seen as the greatest<br>
act of charity and giving of all.  Most small towns and villages will at<br>
least have a shrine acknowledging her, to bless their village with<br>
fertility and protection.  To this ends, many of her followers are<br>
midwives, or almost anyone else with a calling and interest in life and<br>
life magic, and consist of a smattering of the light races.<br>
<br>
To Halina, the importance of life, birth, and protection are so great,<br>
that she has made herself many enemies among the gods of darkness.  In<br>
particular, followers of the unholy trinity of death, disease, and the<br>
undead all loathe her and her follower's interests in protection and<br>
healing magic.  To those who worship Halina, that healing power and<br>
protection is the greatest gift against just such enemies of darkness.<br>
<br>
Though she is not rumoured to appear often, it is said that she watches<br>
over every birth of a newborn child.  Twins and triplets are said to be a<br>
special blessing of the goddess, and those who pay her reverence are said<br>
to live long and healthy lives.  When she does appear, it is said that<br>
she does so in the form of a priestess, usually human, wearing long white<br>
robes, or as a midwife that arrives in town unexpectedly to assist in a<br>
birth where no skilled midwife was present, and vanished just as quickly<br>
afterwards.  Her symbol is that of a simple wooden ankh, the symbol of<br>
life and protection for all who follow her ways.<br>
