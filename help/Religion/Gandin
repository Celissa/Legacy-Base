Gandin - Lord of Storms and the Oceans and all that lies beneath.<br>
<br>
For as long as records have been kept of this planet there has existed<br>
the vast oceans and the life that thrives within it.  These oceans'<br>
boundaries have grown and shrunk with the passing of time.  Gandin's<br>
power seems to rise and fall in accordance with the dynamic size of his<br>
domain.  Gandin's temperament also seems to echo the happenings of the<br>
ocean waters or perhaps it is the other way around and the mood of Gandin<br>
reflects the tidal conditions.  Whichever it may be one thing is for<br>
certain; all that use the rolling oceans to travel are subject to the<br>
whims and wants of this seemingly chaotic god.  Even those at the<br>
boundaries of this vast and virtually unexplored realm are subjugated to<br>
the thrashings that Gandin can cause.<br>
<br>
Worshipped mostly by the seafaring and those who dwell in coastal towns,<br>
Gandin's people are always neutral in their outlook on life.  Neither<br>
supporting the good nor the evil, they care only about their sanctity of<br>
their oceans and seas, feeling the salt breeze on their cheeks and living<br>
life on the rolling waves.  Their major enemies are those champions of<br>
Chandros of Khalmor who see the world in plain black and white, and<br>
represent the two extremes that Gandin seeks to avoid.  Both of the<br>
aforementioned gods also have an interest in fire, and as such, Gandin<br>
sees them as a threat to extinguishing his domain.<br>
<br>
When he appears before his followers, it is usually as a huge water<br>
elemental rising from the depths of the sea, creating massive waves, with<br>
a calm spot somehow around the ship of his followers, sparing them from<br>
harm.  He is also known to appear as an angry face in the storm clouds,<br>
spreading his wrath across the world.  His symbol is that of a gigantic<br>
blue-green tidal wave, breaking against the rocky shore, to symbolize how<br>
he will erode away the very world itself, given time.<br>
