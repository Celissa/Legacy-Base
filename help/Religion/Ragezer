Ragezer - God of Dirt and rocks.<br>
<br>
Bursting from the ground below, Ragezer is known by his followers as the<br>
true god of the earth.  Disdaining and ignoring Duroth's influence in the<br>
matter, they believe Ragezer's power over dirt and rocks is supreme,<br>
because clubs and throwing stones are both made of rocks and both can be<br>
used to crush dwarf skulls.  Ogres and orcs mostly follow him, and the<br>
ogres often wield large clubs or other stone weapons in reverence for<br>
their god.  Orcs usually at least carry a warhammer to symbolize his<br>
crushing power.  He also has a following among those of the realm more<br>
attuned with the baser elements, who disdain 'nature' but care more for<br>
the simple needs of the land.<br>
<br>
Ragezer is thought to his worshippers to have created all of the deserts<br>
and the mountains, and the fact that the followers of Duroth live in one<br>
of these holy mountain ranges annoys them to no avail.  Indeed, there are<br>
many battles between the two peoples over that is the true god of the<br>
earth, and these battles are always ferocious and bloody, with neither<br>
side giving an inch in the opinions of their gods.<br>
<br>
When Ragezer appears to his followers, and he is said to often, because<br>
he has little agenda other than spreading his ways, he is known to appear<br>
as a cross between a desert ogre and an orc, of ogrish size, inheriting<br>
the best features from each race, such as the most powerful tusks and the<br>
nicest configuration of warts.  He is known to wear a large wolf skin<br>
cloak, and always carries a huge stone club with him, which he swings<br>
with the greatest of ease.  His symbol is that of an over-sized club of<br>
solid rock, bursting from the ground in a huge sandy coloured hand, and<br>
can often be found on tribal banners alongside the clans symbol, or<br>
tattooed onto the skin of his people.<br>
