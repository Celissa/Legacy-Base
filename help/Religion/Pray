pray : calls on the gods to assist you<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
If you are in dire need you can try praying for assistance.  The gods of<br>
the game might intervene on your behalf if you have been leading a pious<br>
lifestyle and have not been calling on them too often.  This command does<br>
not contact player gods but instead the god of your religion.  Some<br>
sample needs are light, food, water, and hit points which the gods may<br>
give you in response to your prayers.  The command takes no argument and<br>
your god determines what you are in need of.<br>
