Aelyoni - Goddess of Nature and all that is green and verdant.<br>
<br>
Deep within the lush multi-coloured canopy, hidden amongst the aging<br>
fauna in the heart of the forest lives the entity known to all who<br>
worship the ways of nature-Aelyoni, guardian of nature.  She is known to<br>
her followers as the Lady of the Forest, or sometimes simply as Mother<br>
Nature.  She loves and looks over all plant-life and most animals in the<br>
realm, but has a special place in her heart for the verdant green forests. <br>
It is for this reason that she has attracted a large following of vodekyn<br>
and wood-elven followers, and indeed, many woodsmen and hunters choose to<br>
follow her because of her interests in the woodlands and the animals that<br>
make it their home.<br>
<br>
Not a forest in the land has escaped the gentle hands of Aelyoni or her<br>
followers.  Aelyoni believes that natural beauty is perfection in a<br>
tangible form.  Any unnecessary altering of this natural beauty is<br>
considered to be a perversion though Aelyoni grudgingly allows the races<br>
to use what resources they need to survive.  Aelyoni recognizes the need<br>
for both prey and predators and the need for wood and such to make homes<br>
and stay warm.  Part of the natural order of life is for death to take<br>
its toll so that others may survive whether the entity is plant or animal. <br>
Wanton destruction is not tolerated in any form.  Those who kill or maim<br>
the land for pleasure or for sport are an immediate enemy, and the vyan<br>
race especially are seen as enemies of her people.<br>
<br>
Those who believe they have seen Aelyoni claim that she has appeared to<br>
them as a snowy white wolf of large size, or as a beautiful elven archer<br>
with hair of honey-gold and a longbow made of white birch that seems<br>
almost alive.  Though even without seeing her, there is not a woodsman of<br>
good heart who has not felt her presence.  Her symbol is that of the wolf<br>
that she sometimes likes to appear as, snowy white with an almost<br>
shimmering coat, and eyes of brilliant green, representing the nature<br>
that she holds so dearly.<br>
