Gzarth - God of Stealth and cunning<br>
<br>
Lurking in the deep shadows of the world above, or in the dark tunnels<br>
and caverns of the underground, Gzarth is rarely seen and never heard,<br>
especially not by his prey.  A flashing blade is often their last sight,<br>
or the sudden pain of steel between the ribs or shoulder blades.  He is<br>
the dark god of stealth, cunning, and even assassination, and as such,<br>
holds a special place in his black heart for the goblins of the realm,<br>
their stealth and cunning suiting his unknown purposes well.  Many<br>
followers of the night who hold stealth and silence above raw power also<br>
hold him in high regard.<br>
<br>
Of all the light races, those who pay reverence to Gzarth dislike the<br>
followers of Sindla, the god of luck the most.  The opposing god's<br>
talents and tendencies towards luck and curiosity extend to his<br>
followers, often enabling them to stumble across a thief or assassin<br>
doing Gzarth's will inadvertently, spoiling their element of surprise. <br>
They especially dislike the gnomes, whose mechanical contraptions tend to<br>
make a lot of noise, disrupting the silence they seek, though such noise<br>
often provides a welcome distraction...<br>
<br>
When coming forth before his followers as an omen, Gzarth often appears<br>
in his natural form, that of a four foot tall, spindly goblin, cloaked in<br>
a dark robe and shadows.  This goblin has dark green skin, enabling him<br>
to blend easily into the background, and he always carries a long, wavy<br>
bladed knife.  He likes to appear by stepping forth from the shadows, or<br>
appearing from nowhere, emphasizing his stealth abilities, and he is at<br>
times accompanied by a large dire wolf, his mount and companion.  His<br>
symbol is that of a dull iron dagger, its blade blackened by dried on<br>
blood.<br>
