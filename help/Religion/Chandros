Chandros - God of Justice, chivalry, and courage in battle.<br>
<br>
Chandros, the Radiant One, is the god of natural law and justice.  He is<br>
known among all the gods foremost as the most chivalrous, honourable, and<br>
fair.  Some see his sense of honour and fairness as his greatest<br>
weakness, but his followers harness it as their greatest strength.  They<br>
believe that only through honour and justice does one lead a worthy life. <br>
The laws that he governs are those that are deemed to exist as universal<br>
truths: the right to exist, for example, or the right to choose your own<br>
path in life and are not to be confused with mortal conceptions of law. <br>
It is the enemies of fairness and natural law that Chandros and his<br>
allies in the pantheon strive to defeat.<br>
<br>
Some primitive peoples believe that Chandros is the sun, and worship him<br>
as such, having daily rituals to ensure his return in the morning.  Other<br>
cultures of darker nature loathe the light that Chandros provides,<br>
preferring the blackness of night and the warmth of a full moon.  These<br>
same cultures also tend to use the night as a staging time from which<br>
they wreak havoc on the races that thrive in the daylight.  Especially<br>
among them are the followers of the Ebon Triumvirate, but all dark gods<br>
hold him as a foe.<br>
<br>
The followers of Chandros are held with a great deal of respect<br>
throughout the realm, often known as being his pure hearted servants. <br>
Their almost fanatical sense of honour and justice is seen as a great<br>
asset to the followers of light.  All those who follow his ways travel<br>
the paths of law and good to protect the innocent and fight with virtue,<br>
the epitome of chivalry and a shining example to all.  When Chandros<br>
appears to his followers in an omen, it is most often as a young human<br>
male with brilliant blue eyes and shining golden hair, bedecked in a suit<br>
of polished plate armour and carrying a large bastard sword, its blade<br>
wreathed in white flame.  He always bears a large kite shield, emblazoned<br>
with a bastard sword, point down, against a backdrop of a rising sun, and<br>
this shield is used worldwide as his symbol.<br>
