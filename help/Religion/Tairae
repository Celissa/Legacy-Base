Tairae - God of white magic and of the moon in the heavens.<br>
<br>
As Aelyoni is to nature, and Chandros to the sun, Tairae is often thought<br>
of as being the silvery moon, glowing in the night's sky.  He is the god<br>
of white magic; all that is not perverted about spells and casting.  His<br>
magic is also often associated with cold, the clarity and chill of the<br>
ice similar to the simplicity and purity he tries to portray in spell<br>
casting.  He is most often followed by the high elves, due to their<br>
influences in magic and the world around them, trying to keep the peace<br>
and quality of essence alive.  He also has some followers from the other<br>
light races, who agree and live by his methods of magical teaching. <br>
Seldom is a mage of the dark races concerned with keeping magic pure,<br>
more often than not they seek to corrupt it to enhance their own personal<br>
power.<br>
<br>
Like Chandros, many of his followers like to think of Tairae as being the<br>
moon, circling through the night's sky and watching over his people.  He<br>
is also loathed, though not as much as Chandros, by the dark races who<br>
would choose to attack during the darkness and still of the night, and<br>
have such a plan disrupted by the silvery chill of the moon, disrupting<br>
the perfect blackness that reigned.  The followers of darkness also<br>
detest his holy magic, which at times thwarts their attempts to rule<br>
unchallenged.<br>
<br>
When Tairae chooses to appear before his followers, which is not often,<br>
as he prefers to stay aloof and somewhat separated, leaving his people to<br>
do his bidding, he appears as a tall, elven man, dressed entirely in<br>
silvery silk, with a circlet of ice on his brow.  His face is often<br>
painted with runes and markings in the same silvery colour, and his short<br>
blond hair hangs loosely to his shoulder.  When he appears at other<br>
times, it is as a comet or a shooting star, his omen to the world, which<br>
to those who follow him, is said to have special meaning.  His symbol is<br>
that of a silver crescent moon, rimmed with ice, trailing a shower of<br>
silvery sparks.<br>
