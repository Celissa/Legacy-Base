Sslissist - Father of Dragons and all who bear scales.<br>
<br>
Basking atop a warm, sun-heated boulder in the depths of the swamps lays<br>
the domain of the Father of Dragons.  Sslissist, as he is known in the<br>
mortal tongue, is the lord of all creatures that bear scales, but is only<br>
openly worshipped by some of the more intelligent creatures, like the<br>
lizardmen and naga who pay homage to him.  As a god, he seeks to remain<br>
neutral in all things, caring only for his scaly creatures, including the<br>
dragons of the realm, which he sees as his sacred children, and the more<br>
intelligent ones, though they may not worship him formally, acknowledge<br>
his presence and pay the respect he deserves.  He is seldom worshipped by<br>
members of other races, though those that do have a heavy, and perhaps<br>
unhealthy, interest in his creatures.<br>
<br>
Certain members of the pantheon consider Sslissist to have somewhat of an<br>
elevated view of his own self, but they are of course mistaking his lack<br>
of interest in the foolish gods around him for the simple joy of existing. <br>
Followers believe that all creatures have a right to exist and to live as<br>
they choose.  Followers take comfort in knowing that those who are evil<br>
and those who are good tend to balance out in the end.  He realizes that<br>
the death and life of creatures is in the natural order of things, so<br>
understands when a lizardman hunter must slay a python for its meat,<br>
skin, and skull.  However, he does take it personally when creatures slay<br>
those who worship him, be they lizardman, naga, or dragon alike.<br>
<br>
Though it is not well known what this elusive being truly looks like, and<br>
his priests certainly do not divulge this secret, it is thought that he<br>
most likely appears as his symbol in the lands, that of an ash grey<br>
dragon, resting on a boulder of smooth obsidian.  This symbol appears on<br>
the battle standards of many a lizardman warrior, as he charges into<br>
battle to avenge the wrongdoings against his fellow tribesmen.<br>
