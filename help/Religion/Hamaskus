Hamaskus - God of Time, Knowledge, and all learning.<br>
<br>
While Tairae could be thought of as being the god of white magic, and<br>
Khalmor perhaps as the necromantic god of the black, Hamaskus is the god<br>
of neither, both, and all that lies in-between.  He is the keeper of the<br>
scrolls of the Gods, recording knowledge, and controlling the flow of<br>
time with an enormous water clock, which is rumoured, to have been<br>
constructed for him by Duroth.  His principle worshippers are the<br>
learned, both scholars and their students from the races of light or<br>
darkness, who have an interest in the keepings of time, knowledge, and<br>
learning.<br>
<br>
Though Hamaskus has no real enemies among the other gods, he has few<br>
friends.  The main oppositions to his works and those of his followers<br>
are those who would seek to destroy them, simply because they are not<br>
educated enough to understand them.  The followers of Ghnomb, for<br>
example, who would seek to eat his books, claiming they gain knowledge<br>
from doing so, or those of Ragezer who would just smash his books in a<br>
random act of boredom and violence.<br>
<br>
He is said never to appear in the mortal realms, constantly scribing<br>
notes for his works, but his priests describe him as being an ancient,<br>
grey-bearded man, wearing voluminous robes and sitting at a heavy oak<br>
desk.  He has never in their legends once left his post, but it is<br>
rumoured that when times of world threatening trouble come, he will come<br>
to the earth and use his magic to set things back to their natural flow. <br>
His emblem is that of an open book, banded in blue, with an hourglass<br>
emblazoned on the left hand page, and several paragraphs of illegible<br>
script on the right.<br>
