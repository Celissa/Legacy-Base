Ghnomb - God of Eating and hunger.<br>
<br>
Known as the Devourer, Ghnomb is a source of insatiable hunger that knows<br>
no bounds.  Where he dwells is unknown, but he is known to hunt all over<br>
the earth, searching for prey to fill his stomach.  The main reason this<br>
slavering evil took on followers is because their sacrifices serve to<br>
feed his hunger.  Mostly trolls, whose desire for things to eat and<br>
hunting serves his purposes well, worship him.  To them, he is the God of<br>
'Eat' and covers all-important details of life, such as eating things,<br>
killing things so you can eat them, and hunting things to eat.<br>
<br>
Other than the trolls, few people worship Ghnomb, though a rare few orcs,<br>
goblins, and ogres may follow him.  All recognize his presence though,<br>
and many fear angering a troll shaman whom might decide turn the offender<br>
into the next meal of the Great One's hunger.  His worshippers have no<br>
real specific enemies, for life is generally as simple as eating anyone<br>
who does not aid you, but they have a special like of attacking the<br>
villages to which Shinanne offers her protection, for they always have<br>
bountiful harvests and a lot of food to eat.<br>
<br>
Those who see Ghnomb are invariably eaten, though his shamans have<br>
reported his appearance for all to know and fear.  He appears to them as<br>
a large, two-headed troll with dark green skin, eyes of pure black, and a<br>
strong, muscular body.  His claws are of obsidian and razor sharp, and<br>
his fangs are covered in blood and gore.  His most striking feature is a<br>
large, jawed mouth where his stomach would be, its teeth constantly<br>
gnashing and biting, waiting for food.  His symbol is that of a rabid<br>
dire wolf, its hungry jaws wide open, stains of blood on its dark coat.<br>
