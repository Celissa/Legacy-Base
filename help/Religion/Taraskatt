Taraskatt - God of Plague and disease.<br>
<br>
Taraskatt is the god of plague, disease, and pestilence.  Pure evil,<br>
darkness, and shadow are the domain of the Black Unicorn, who is a<br>
subtle, pervasive god whose powers are vast and attacks are difficult to<br>
defend against.  He relishes inflicting not just death but torture to all<br>
his victims, there are few things worse than seeing yourself rot away. <br>
Diseases aren't just objects or things to Taraskatt, they are his living<br>
children who need to grow, feed, and reproduce just like all other life<br>
must.  What makes him evil is the comfort he takes from watching his<br>
'children' thrive while its host creature writhes in restless torment. <br>
But such is the way of life for him; the weak will perish while the<br>
strong survive.<br>
<br>
Taraskatt is a part of the Ebon Triumvirate, with his brothers of Khalmor<br>
and Xharax.  Their roles all vary, but Taraskatt's current agenda is to<br>
raise a new plague, a horde of beasts and worshippers to sweep across the<br>
land and destroy all in its wake.  To this end, his greatest enemies<br>
among the light gods are Halina, goddess off life, Chandros, god of<br>
justice, and Tairae, the god of white magic.  He recruits any evil-minded<br>
creature that wishes to serve his purposes, making no discrimination<br>
between the races if they are willing to serve his ultimate goal.<br>
<br>
When Taraskatt appears as an avatar to his people, it is as one of two<br>
forms.  A non-descript human male, known as the 'Peacock King' whose<br>
appearance differs, as this visage is often used for infiltrations<br>
purposes.  His other form, the one he uses most often to strike fear into<br>
the hearts and souls of his enemies, is that of the Black Unicorn, an<br>
ebon masterpiece of the traditional champion of light.  As such, his<br>
symbol is that of a wild-eyed black unicorn, its front left hoof raised<br>
high, ready to begin the march.  Forward the Unicorn!<br>
