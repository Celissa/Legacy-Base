Sindla - God of Luck and travelers.<br>
<br>
Known to all as the prankster or trickster god, Sindla is a cheeky figure<br>
that often roams the world in guises, causing (mostly harmless) mischief<br>
and the occasional good deed to balance it out.  Thought of by most as<br>
being some kind of odd leprechaun or sprite, his true form is actually<br>
unknown to all but perhaps his most wily priests.  But despite his<br>
appearance, he is thought to be a great traveller of the realm, and<br>
offers protection to all who walk the paths of the world in search of<br>
luck and fortune.<br>
<br>
Due to their curious nature, a great many gnomes pay homage to Sindla,<br>
the aspects of curiosity and luck fitting in perfectly with their natural<br>
desires to roam and adventure, and to tinker with machinery and gadgets. <br>
Some gnomish priests say that their affinity with Sindla stops them from<br>
having too many accidents then again; luck is always known to be fickle<br>
and to run out when you need it, but its blessings are even more profound. <br>
A smattering of halflings and members of other races with an interest in<br>
luck or travelling often find a home in his flock, and those who are a<br>
follower of his often come to odds with the followers of Gzarth, their<br>
lucky and curious nature often coming to odds with his stealthy and<br>
cunning worshippers.<br>
<br>
Though he appears rarely on the realm, he is said to appear most often as<br>
a face in the crowd before a lucky roll of the dice, or as an<br>
undistinguishable humanoid traveller of small size, often decked out in<br>
gaudy clothing and riding a spotted pony, or carrying a banded travelling<br>
staff.  His symbol, well known to his followers, is that of a spinning<br>
golden coin, sparkling with light and splendour, which often appears not<br>
only on the more traditional temples, but on shrines of his in gambling<br>
houses, and travellers way stations such as inns.<br>
