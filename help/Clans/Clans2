Plan A: Can be alignment based clan.  Either good or evil.  Good clans<br>
seek to sort out the world and evil clans seek to reap as much profit as<br>
possible.  Such a clan can accept any race.<br>
Plan B: Cause based clan.  This takes more argument.  They can choose between good/neutral or neutral/evil but never good and evil in the same clan.<br>
<br>
Restrictions<br>
Good/Evil cannot be accepted in same clan.<br>
If lawful is accepted you may not mix elves/dwarves/gnomes/lizards with<br>
orcs/trolls/ogres/goblins <br>
Chaotic evil may not be in any clan.<br>
