                 The Dwarven Labor Union<br>
      Price List for the Building of Clan Strongholds<br>
<br>
*  The basic clan stronghold consists of three rooms and your clan<br>
insignia.  Flat rate for this is 350k.<br>
<br>
* A basic locked door and key comes complimentary with your clan<br>
house.  However for those of you who would like a little more secrecy,<br>
you can add a hidden entrance to your clan house.  The price of this<br>
added feature will be between 15k and 50k depending on how<br>
elaborate you want to get.  Additional locked, non-secret doors are<br>
priced at 15K.<br>
<br>
* Extra rooms leading up to a Stronghold will be priced at 25k<br>
for the first two rooms, then 50k for each room after that.<br>
<br>
* Secret rooms will not be part of the basic three rooms.  To create<br>
a secret room, you will be charged 100k for an extra room as well as<br>
an additional 50k for the concealment of the door and hidden lever.<br>
<br>
* Storage rooms and banks are inclusive and are available for your<br>
stronghold at the cost of 100k for the flag, with an additional<br>
purchase cost of 100k for the room itself.  These rooms save over<br>
crashes/reboots, and do not reset.  Items will stay indefinitely either<br>
on the ground or in chests, should you choose to purchase them.  Large,<br>
300 pound capacity chests are priced at 3.5k and 1000 pound capacity<br>
chests are priced at 10k each.<br>
<br>
*  Adding arenas to your stronghold is also possible, at a cost of<br>
100k for the extra room plus 100k for the arena flag.<br>
<br>
*  Extras in the room, such as pictures on the wall you can look at,<br>
will cost you 10k per description.<br>
<br>
*  When you're relaxing in your new Stronghold or having an important<br>
meeting, you may want to have a few tables, chairs or couches for you and<br>
your guests.  The price for a basic piece of furniture will be 5k,<br>
but if you want some exotic custom item, it's going to be charged at a<br>
custom price.  (Such as a throne or a dragon leather couch.) <br>
<br>
* For those of you who would like a fountain built in your<br>
Stronghold, the charge is 50k for materials and labour.  Soup<br>
cauldrons will also cost 75k for stocking and labour.  Note that<br>
there will be no fountains containing any special liquids, such as youth<br>
potion, taengle wine, as it is beyond the skill of the dwarven laborers.<br>
<br>
*  Actions, such as 'You smell a delicious aroma waft up from the<br>
kettle of soup,' will cost 25k per action.  Note that elaborate<br>
actions may cost up to four times the normal rate, dependant on their<br>
complexity.<br>
<br>
* Extra-Planer placement, The charge for this is high as it takes an<br>
extreme amount of arcane energy to accomplish the task.  The cost is<br>
500k for a new stronghold to be placed on its own plane and 750k<br>
for an existing stronghold to be 'transported'.  This is not available<br>
at this time.<br>
<br>
If there is something you would like for your clan house that is not<br>
listed here, please ask about it and it can be submitted to the Union for<br>
consideration.  However, Dwarves being the practical creatures they are,<br>
please try to keep your requests within the bounds of reality.<br>
