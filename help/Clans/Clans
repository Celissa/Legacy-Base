<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
To start a clan you must recruit people to swear allegiance to you and<br>
your cause.  You must also be at least level 10. A starting fee of<br>
20pp is required to begin a new clan.  Clans will require a charter that<br>
states your clan's ideals or purpose, and at least five members to be<br>
approved and receive the benefits of a codified institution.  A clan may<br>
choose its members according to its charter within a few simple<br>
guidelines.<br>
<br>
*Clans may have good members or evil members, but not both.<br>
Good/neutral and evil/neutral are allowed.  (In the instance of a heavily<br>
role-played clan, this rule 'may' be overlooked.  A clan is only<br>
considered a roleplay clan when they have provided logs of rp to the<br>
immortal staff.  Roleplay isn't a convenience you can claim for the sake<br>
of bypassing rules.) <br>
*Certain races may not be in a clan together. (For instance,<br>
vyans and elves would not be in the same clan.)  In the instance of a clan<br>
that takes its members from but a single alignment, racial barriers may be<br>
crossed.<br>
*Those who have chosen to follow a chaotic evil alignment may not<br>
join a clan.  Chaotic evil characters are motivated solely by the desire<br>
for personal gain and pleasure.  Since the interests of others are utterly<br>
meaningless to them, they are unlikely to be attracted to the unity of<br>
ideals found in a clan.<br>
<br>
Clans will have the option of remaining unknown.  If you do not wish your<br>
clan to be seen on the public clan list, you may toggle the option<br>
Exist.Known.  If you want your charter publicly displayed without your<br>
members showing, you may toggle the option Members.Known.<br>
<br>
Once your options are set and your clan charter is in place, an immortal<br>
will look it over and set your clan as approved.<br>
<br>
Also, the minimum level for each clan must be level 10.  You may apply<br>
for a lower level, but it is extremely unlikely it will be approved.<br>
