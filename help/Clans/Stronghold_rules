This helpfile clarifies a few rules about strongholds that is not<br>
discussed in help strongholds.  Be sure to check this list regularly, as<br>
more regulations or frequently asked questions about strongholds may be<br>
answered in this help file.<br>
<br>
Thematic Restrictions:<br>
I will be strongly enforcing the theme of your stronghold.  What this<br>
means is that if you are an evil, secret society of assassins, you will<br>
not be allowed to build a cheerful castle of white stone near Chiiron. <br>
This includes locations as well.  Dark-themed strongholds will not be<br>
allowed near or in light towns without extreme cost or in-character<br>
reasons.  The same applies to light-themed strongholds, which will not be<br>
allowed near or in dark towns.<br>
<br>
Note that for the purposes of determining which towns are considered to<br>
be dark or light, Medienne is considered a light town while Sos-kul is<br>
considered truly neutral and either set of races can build nearby.  All<br>
other towns should be fairly self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
Mobs in Strongholds<br>
Mobs will be allowed in strongholds, but with the following list of<br>
restrictions: <br>
<br>
* No trainers.<br>
This should be fairly obvious.  No mobs that can train skills will be<br>
allowed inside strongholds.<br>
<br>
* Restricted shopkeepers.<br>
This means that no shopkeepers in your stronghold may purchase items,<br>
custom items, or reset with any items in their inventory that you do not<br>
provide.  This means that if you had a bartender it could only sell items<br>
that you gave to it.<br>
<br>
* No private hunting mobs.<br>
This means that you can have no mobs which would provide a private<br>
hunting grounds for your clan.  No mob in your stronghold may skin for<br>
anything or reset with any items in its inventory that you do not provide. <br>
Any mobs in your stronghold may not be killed.  Violating this rule is<br>
considered a very serious offense.<br>
<br>
* No wandering/aggressive mobs.<br>
Your mob may not leave the stronghold under any circumstances.  It may<br>
not be aggressive, although it can block players in the case of a<br>
guard-type mob.<br>
<br>
* No tameable mobs.<br>
No mobs in strongholds can be tamed.<br>
<br>
Examples of allowable mobs would be:<br>
A small white cat which roams around your stronghold.<br>
<br>
A hulking troll guard which guards your treasure pile, blocking any who<br>
try to approach.<br>
<br>
No prices are provided for mobs in strongholds, as they will be evaluated<br>
on a case-by-case basis.  But note that more complicated mobs will be<br>
increasingly expensive, although even the smallest mob will be quite<br>
expensive.<br>
