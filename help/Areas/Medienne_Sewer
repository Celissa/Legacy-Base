<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The human city of Medienne has an extensive sewer system located beneath<br>
its streets.  Parents often threaten their misbehaving children with<br>
scary stories of strange, dangerous beasts, such as alligators and evil<br>
humanoid rats, that inhabit the foul-smelling sewers and will creep up<br>
and abduct them.  How much of it is fact or fiction is not known, but<br>
some brave (or insane) adventurers who have explored the area claim that<br>
indeed many of the tales are true.<br>
