Ancient tales, their origins lost in the misty corridors of time, tell of<br>
a strange land of wondrous creatures ruled over by the god, Duroth. <br>
Sadly, knowledge of the exact whereabouts of this fabulous place was lost<br>
when a goblish horde drove the dwarven people from the Everwinters. <br>
Vague references to a bridge and dwarven statues are the only clues that<br>
still survive.<br>
