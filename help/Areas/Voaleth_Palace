The ruler of Voaleth lives in this grand palace just past the southern city<br>
gate.  This great residence is now inhabited by the Tyrant who rules the<br>
city and its environs, making it a place where guests are no longer very<br>
welcome.  Those brave enough to visit may find great rewards, and great<br>
danger.<br>
