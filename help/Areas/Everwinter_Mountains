The gnoll infested peaks of the Everwinter Mountains span the eastern<br>
coast line of the New World.  Their shimmering peaks are capped with ice<br>
all year round, some scholars speculating that the coldness of the<br>
mountains comes from an unnatural source.  As well as goblinoids, wild<br>
animals and roaming gnoll warbands, the Everwinter peaks house a number of<br>
ancient runes, both abandoned and reclaimed that harbor much darker foes<br>
for an intrepid adventurer.  According to legends delved from the dwarves,<br>
a mass of interconnecting tunnels once existed beneath the snow-clad<br>
peaks; some of these dark passages are now used by Vyan and their kind to<br>
swiftly travel unseen.<br>
