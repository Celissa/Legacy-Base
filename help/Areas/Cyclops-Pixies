The ancient battle between good and evil exists near a mystical waterfall<br>
hidden within the Cairn Mountains.  The cyclops have their haunt within<br>
their dark caverns, while the pixies frolic amidst an enchanted forest. <br>
The small strip of forest and mountainside which separate them have been<br>
the battlegrounds for many a struggle over the ages, with the<br>
all-powerful shaman of the cyclops leading his hordes against the magics<br>
of the pixie high sorceress.  While the smallest pixies might fall victim<br>
to lesser fighters and mages, only the strongest, boldest, and most<br>
foolhardy adventurers had best venture into the den of the cyclops.<br>
