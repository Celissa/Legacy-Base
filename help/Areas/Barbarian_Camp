For many ages past, a nomadic tribe of human barbarians have roamed the<br>
northern regions of the realm, hunting reindeer and other game.  They<br>
survived many global weather catastrophes and bitter wars with dwarves<br>
and elves.  Many ancient elves and dwarves can attest to their deft<br>
hunting skills and fighting prowess.  Recently, a small band of dwarven<br>
explorers have uncovered their current settlement, somewhere to the<br>
northwest of Kha-da beyond an old mage tower.  Generally hostile to<br>
outsiders, the barbarians should be regarded as a possible threat to<br>
civilizations around the area, warn the explorers.<br>
