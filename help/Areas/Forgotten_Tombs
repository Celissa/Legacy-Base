Long before cities were established, the races were barbaric and<br>
scattered across the realm.  Some met and traded basic goods, but others<br>
were not even this advanced.  Nearly all of these peoples lived in tribes<br>
and clans.<br>
One such clan was the Clan of the Wolf, who took shelter in caverns and<br>
hunted for their food.  What is known about this clan of primitive humans<br>
has only recently been discovered.  By sheer chance, the caverns they<br>
resided in have been discovered and partly explored.  Found just north of<br>
the present day city of Chiiron, the secrets remaining within the Wolf<br>
Clan's caverns and tombs are currently unknown.<br>
