The southern tip of the world is home to the Knights of the White Stag,<br>
these paladins of Chandros fight an endless war with the goblin hoards of<br>
the eastern Everwinter Range.  With the teachings of Chandros the<br>
Judicant's wander the free lands settling minor squabbles and dispersing<br>
justice to the farms and isolated villages of the free lands.  Although<br>
still in its infancy the Duke Calidar has bold plans to settle the savage<br>
lands under the crisp banner of the white stag.<br>
