<h1> Description </h1>
A wonderous collection of trash is piled up in the Terr'kaa's Dump south<br>
of Medienne.  Some say that while walking through the piles you can hear<br>
the faint crazed mumblings of the caretaker of the dump, Terr'kaa himself. <br>
But beware of the horrors that sit waiting behind the iron barred gates,<br>
for it has eaten its share of daring adventurers.<br>
