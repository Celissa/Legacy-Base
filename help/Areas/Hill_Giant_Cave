<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The folks of Kha-da and its out lying settlements have lately been troubled<br>
by marauding giants.  Huge, brown-haired hill giants, dressed only in<br>
loincloths, ambush caravans, plunder small villages and generally destroy<br>
things.  The dwarves are massing to destroy them, though, so far, their<br>
efforts have had minimal affect; the giants simply retreat to their lair<br>
and close the massive boulder behind them.  Many treasure-hunting thieves<br>
have ventured into the lair after the spoils of the raiding giants, though<br>
none has ever returned to tell the tale.<br>
