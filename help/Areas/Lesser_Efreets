A poor lost soul has stumbled across a powerful item, an artifact which<br>
was never meant to be touched by human hands.  The power of magick of the<br>
artifact, the ethergem, drove the man to madness, and he began using the<br>
power of the gem to create a portal to the ethereal plane from out own<br>
world.  Once He had found his way across the dimensional barrier, his<br>
madness only grew worse.  Coming to another great barrier, that of the<br>
ends of the ethereal plane itself, he summoned hordes of terrible efreets<br>
to guard him as he worked on a way to break down the final barrier.<br>
 <br>
In the five hundred years since his sanity left him, he has not found a<br>
way to cross the final threshhold into the unknown beyond.<br>
 <br>
Nor has he given up his mad quest.<br>
 <br>
In the end, should he succeed, the poor madman could possibly destroy the<br>
material plane as we know it.<br>
 <br>
It is said that the gateway can be found across a hidden stream on a<br>
hidden trail in the southeast.<br>
