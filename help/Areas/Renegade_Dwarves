Spelunkers have reported seeing the furtive movements of diminutive<br>
figures in the cave-riddled cliffs north of Chiiron.  The description of<br>
the beings seen in the caves matches the description of a band of dwarves<br>
cast out from their clans in the mountains of the north.  Adventuring<br>
souls exploring the region claim that the dwarves have already dug in,<br>
and are well prepared for any attacks.  There seems to be only one real<br>
entrance into the caves they have claimed as their own, and it seems to<br>
be guarded at all times.  Adventurers are advised to use caution when<br>
approaching the aggressive outcasts.<br>
