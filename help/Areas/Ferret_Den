Peace and tranquility reigned supreme for centuries...some say eons...in<br>
the quiet little valley that lies far to the north and west of Chiiron<br>
near the diminutive halfling village known as Abhanthorp - or so the<br>
locals would have outsiders believe.  There are rumors...whispers to be<br>
overheard by those that listen carefully...that this is, in fact, not<br>
entirely the truth.<br>
<br>
Within the confines of the local Mess Hall or hanging out near Old<br>
Bigglesoot's shop, gossip abounds of giant beasts, fearsome beyond belief<br>
and cunning as foxes, whose burrow lies to the south and east of the<br>
village palisade.  These creatures, the tales say, are 'tetched' by<br>
magic, as is all within the hidden vale.<br>
