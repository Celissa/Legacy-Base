A large expanse of woods lies between the human city of Medienne and the<br>
Dragonspire Mountains.  It is well known for both its capacity as a good<br>
hunting ground and its ability to lose entire parties of hunters.  If you<br>
plan to leave the trail, be sure to bring along someone experienced in<br>
woodlore and exploring.  For the avid hunter, the woods have produced<br>
everything from quaint little squirrels to ferocious grizzlies.  Among<br>
the hunters' favorites are the agile stags that populate the forest.<br>
