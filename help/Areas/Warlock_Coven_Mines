<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
An enormous, abandoned dwarven mine lies just north of the war-torn city of<br>
Medienne, near the wide expanse of rolling hills.  It has been said that a<br>
evil coven of powerful warlocks, wreaking wanton destruction, now occupy<br>
the mine, having defeated and enslaved the dwarves first discovered the<br>
site.  A tired old dwarf, known as Gimnod, currently resides outside the<br>
mine, and if asked politely, graciously answers any questions regarding<br>
this mysterious place.<br>
