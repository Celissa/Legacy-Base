Cloaked in a perpetual winter's blanket, the Frostfur Woods takes its<br>
name from the icy coating and the tribes of gnolls inhabiting its dark<br>
reaches.  Nestled in amongst the Everwinter Mountains, the forest offers<br>
food and shelter to its inhabitants.  Various types of trees are found<br>
amongst the woods, although the dominant ones are firs.  Toward its<br>
eastern boundaries, the remains of a dwarven city spread out over its<br>
outer rim, being slowly absorbed by the expanding forest.  Little is<br>
known of the gnolls in this part of the world; although no encounters<br>
have been overly aggressive, perhaps their guarding warders protect the<br>
tribe's homeland from prying eyes.  Built so near to a ruin it wouldn't<br>
be unlikely to find some treasure delved from the city within the hold.<br>
