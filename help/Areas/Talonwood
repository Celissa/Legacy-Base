Long ago the llewyrr of the Vaasa came upon a lesser developed tribe of<br>
goblinoids.  The tribe of goblinoids were very primitive and were<br>
persecuted, even by other goblins.  The llewyrr took pity on them and<br>
gave them refuge in the vastness of the Vaasa.  The llewyrr called them<br>
tasloi, an ancient elven word meaning "wood goblin", and began to teach<br>
them how to survive in the woods.<br>
   <br>
Things went well for a few brief years, then the tasloi turned on the<br>
llewyrr.  What started as spiteful pranks by the tasloi grew until it<br>
came to all out war.  In the end, the llewyrr hunted down most of the<br>
tasloi and managed to chase the rest out of the Vaasa.  Enough of the<br>
tasloi survived to form small bands, and every few decades a population<br>
explosion seems to occur and the llewyrr are plagued by tasloi hungry for<br>
elf flesh.  Recently they tasloi seem to have learned to hide from even<br>
the vigilant llewyrr scouts and rangers and have taken to using ambush<br>
tactics.  This time, they have made it further back into the Vaasa then<br>
ever before and the llewyrr are becoming concerned.<br>
  <br>
The tasloi live primarily in the Talonwood to the southeast of the Vaasa. <br>
Both the tasloi and many of the other denizens of the Talonwood are quite<br>
dangerous.  Most scribes agree you should not attempt to enter before<br>
level 15, the ones that didn't agree thought you should wait even longer,<br>
but who ever listens to scribes these days.<br>
