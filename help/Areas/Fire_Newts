Brithbarad has been abustle about rumors of an underground cavern located<br>
somewhere north of the city.  Several orcs have come home with fiery<br>
lacerations on their bodies, but they are silent about it and only curse<br>
their luck at not finding the treasures believed to have been there. <br>
Reports of strange, red lizards have been the talk of the town as well,<br>
and many believe these creatures responsible for an orc chieftain who was<br>
found dead from burning scars just outside the rumoured area.<br>
