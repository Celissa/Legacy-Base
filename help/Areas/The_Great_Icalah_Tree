Explorers tell of the discovery of a ancient, old tree in a forest of<br>
prickly porcupines.  The tree is of a type never before seen in the realms<br>
by these intrepid travelers.  After much discussion, all of it sober, of<br>

cuttings from the tree, before dispersing and vowing never to speak of the<br>
strange, flying creatures in the tree.<br>
