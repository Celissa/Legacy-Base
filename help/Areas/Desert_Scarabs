Buried under the sand in the heart of the Naraki desert, a colony of desert<br>
scarabs lives in their sandy tunnels.  Led by their crystalline queen, the<br>
beetles work and dig, doing what busy beetles do.  However, these busy<br>
beetles are the size of a halfling, or a gnome.  Generally oblivious to the<br>
intrusions of adventurers, the beetles will defend their lair if<br>
challenged... or if someone looks like they would be a tasty dinner.<br>
