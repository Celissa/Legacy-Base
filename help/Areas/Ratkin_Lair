In the underground realms that lie beneath many great cites these little<br>
creatures thrive.  Sages speculate that ratkins were first created by a<br>
sorcerer to be used as spies, thieves, and assassins.  Unfortunately,<br>
they escaped and have spread throughout the realms.  Their nature matches<br>
their creator's purpose; they are dark, malicious creatures, evil and<br>
cunning.<br>
<br>
Those that have the misfortune to stumble into a Ratkin lair describe a<br>
twisted collection of corridors and boltholes, traps and blades in the<br>
dark, adding to the horror.  The creatures are hoarders.  They steal and<br>
collect all manner of junk, and hidden amongst 'treasure' is the<br>
occasional bright bauble of some value.  Like raven and crows the Ratkin<br>
seem attracted to shiny objects.<br>
<br>
When enough gather together a larger, more vicious leader may arise. <br>
When this happens, the danger from these creatures dramatically<br>
increases, as they become organized in their efforts.  Several townships<br>
have had kidnapping's and murders at the hands of these cutthroats. <br>
These types of attacks only seem to occur when a lair has a warleader and<br>
several bone shakers in it.<br>
<br>
Disturbingly, several people have reported sighting a Ratkin possessing<br>
magical powers.  Dubbed boneshakers, these creatures adorn themselves<br>
with a mantle of finger bones and knuckles, perhaps using them in their<br>
divinations and invocations.<br>
<br>
It is recommended that on discovering a lair, a wise person will hasten<br>
away, rather than take untold risk to explore.  However if one is braver<br>
than wise, the library may be convinced to part with a sum of money<br>
to anyone able to further information on these evil creatures.<br>
