As shrouded in mystery as it is the fog that veils it from sight,<br>
Forgotten Isle lies in the Moonfall Sea a long boat ride away from the<br>
closest inhabited settlement.  Little is known about the mountainous<br>
interior of the island, for those that have ventured beyond the rickety<br>
pier of the landing have never returned.  Local rumor has it, however,<br>
that the fierce inhabitants of the island worship a strange god and<br>
practice vile magics.<br>
<br>
It is not a place for the unlearned or for those unskilled in the highest<br>
combat skills.<br>
