During the fall of the dwarven people many of their citadels and mountain<br>
homes were over run by various fell beasts.  Even in dwarven legends the<br>
battle for TulMarkha was particularly fierce, it is said that no dwarf<br>
escaped the city alive.  Buried deep within the Everwinter Mountains the<br>
dwarves mined copper and iron the veins going deep into the earth.  Some<br>
tales say that they uncovered a dark secret that destroyed them others<br>
whisper of betrayal and murder in the kings court, What ever the truth<br>
only the brave venture in to the frozen heart of the dwarven keep.<br>
