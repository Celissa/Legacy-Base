Moonfall Hamlet, a humble fishing village perched near the coast of the<br>
Moonfall Sea, has seen better days.  What few people remain there are<br>
either long time towns' folk, children, or too old or tired to relocate. <br>
Once a much more populous location, it was a busy fishing port where many<br>
boats put out to sea to fish the frigid waters of the Moonfall.  The<br>
villagers welcome all travelers, for the few coppers spent can mean the<br>
difference between an evening's meal or not.<br>
