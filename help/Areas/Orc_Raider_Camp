The citizens of Sos-Kul have been reporting strange happenings at night<br>
near and around the city.  They speak of dark shapes entering the town at<br>
night and people missing in the morning and supplies being raided. <br>
Several lizardmen have vanished in the swamp to the north of the town<br>
while investigating these happenings.<br>
