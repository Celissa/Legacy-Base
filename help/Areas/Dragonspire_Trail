Recently, heavy snowfalls have inflicted the Dragonspire Mountains with<br>
avalanches of incredible magnitude.  A party of adventurers, returning<br>
from an expedition to purge the vile yetis from the land, report the<br>
discovery of an heretofore unknown trail.  Said party, wounded and<br>
bleeding from recent battles, did not explore the new trail but reported<br>
seeing monstrous-sized footprints in the snow near the trailhead.<br>
