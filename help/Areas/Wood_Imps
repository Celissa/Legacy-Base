Travelers between Chiiron and Medienne have been reporting odd occurrences<br>
on their journeys between the two towns.  Some of these reports cite<br>
incidences of lost pets, horses disappearing, and one case of a vanishing<br>
party member.  Accounts vary as to the exact location of these events, but<br>
all agree that the events happened nearer to Chiiron and the ancient forest<br>
rising along the mountains that drop down to the Sea of Stars, than to the<br>
more populated areas around Medienne.<br>
<br>
Because they live in close proximity to a large colony of wood spiders, but<br>
primarily for lack of a better name, the creatures residing within the dark<br>
woods to the north of the Northern Sea Trail have been dubbed wood imps.<br>
Although not imps in the strictest sense, in appearance they most certainly<br>
resemble the lesser forms of these demonic creatures.<br>
<br>
Wood imps have a budding, primitive community just emerging from the lowest<br>
forms of barbarism.  They are a loosely formed group of hunter/gatherers<br>
turned scavengers and predators upon the weak and undefended.  They have no<br>
leader as such, but their shaman uses a feral wit and cunning to manipulate<br>
them.  Although at this time they are no threat to the well-armed and<br>
skilled adventurers, the lone traveler and those less experienced in the<br>
art of battle would be hard pressed to ward off an organized attack from<br>
these savage creatures.<br>
