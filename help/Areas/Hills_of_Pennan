Around the Greened Way west of Pennan lies many hills that overlook the<br>
verdant valley of Pennan.  Rich with wildlife, this area also provides<br>
fertile ground for domesticated animals to feed upon.  The region is also<br>
famous for legendary monsters as well as wandering thieves and cutthroats.<br>
<br>
Hobgoblin Outpost (Level 15):<br>
<br>
Somewhere off the end of the Greened Way lies a once abandoned guard<br>
outpost, now taken over by a fiercely xenophobic tribe of hobgoblins. <br>
Larger than their cousins, the goblins, these creatures are about similar<br>
in height to humans but are considerably heavier.  Not known to raid<br>
towns, the hobgoblins are, however, famous for their cruelty and torture<br>
of those unfortunate enough to stumble into their lair.  Those who<br>
consider venturing into the outpost are advised to proceed with caution<br>
as the hobgoblins boast very capable warriors, as well as magical aid<br>
from their incantrix.<br>
<br>
The Silent Pines (Level 15):<br>
<br>
South of the Greened Way lies a thick cluster of pine trees.  Tales of<br>
great danger and mystery surround this area, which some say is draped<br>
with gauze-like webs.  Those who have explored this region swear that the<br>
pines themselves are sentient and resentful towards intruders.<br>
