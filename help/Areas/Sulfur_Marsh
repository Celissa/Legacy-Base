Under the blanket of the mountain beeches the damp ground gives way to<br>
marshlands that are noted for their pungent aroma and large frog-life. <br>
Poachers often ply their trade around the swamp, seeking food and skins to<br>
trade to near-by Talidars.  Competing with the poachers are feral<br>
lizardmen, a small colony of the wild creatures hunting and gathering<br>
through the marsh lands, their prey the giant otters that scamper through<br>
the ferns.<br>
