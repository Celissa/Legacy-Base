A race of small humanoids with dog-like heads, the kobolds are a major<br>
nuisance to the dwarves.  The vile little creatures breed and grow at an<br>
obnoxious rate, providing a nearly limitless army of adversaries for any<br>
who try to dwell in the northern mountains.  A kobold den of significant<br>
size exists somewhat to the west of the dwarven citidel of Kha-Da. <br>
Travellers in the area are advised to use caution as these kobolds are<br>
rumored to be better equipped and trained than most.  If you plan on<br>
touring the northern mountains, it might be wise to talk to a few dwarves<br>
first and find out what you can about the kobolds first, just in case you<br>
should come across them.<br>
