Long ago, Khutek, the hedge wizard, was practicing a powerful spell<br>
involving calming mists.  Being an inexperienced mageling at the time,<br>
the spell failed, and disastrous environmental consequences occurred in<br>
the marsh where he had been training.  Khutek chucked it up as a learning<br>
experience and moved on.<br>
<br>
The enchanted mists still envelop the region south of the Elhanni River<br>
today.  Numerous rumors abound of mysterious creatures that now inhabit<br>
the region, mutated by the magic that Khutek unleashed years ago.<br>
