Many ages ago, the Sea of Stars was a watery hunting field for a ruthless<br>
crew of pirates.  Led by their foul-mouthed captain, the pirates would<br>
terrorize passing merchant ships and loot whatever they could come across. <br>
Little is known about what has become of them.  Some say they drowned in<br>
the ocean one day due to their greed -- their ship being unable to carry<br>
so much loot.  Others say that their ship is buried deep beneath the<br>
southwestern part of the Sea of Stars, while their decayed bodies still<br>
haunt the area.<br>
