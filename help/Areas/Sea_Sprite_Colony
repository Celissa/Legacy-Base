As a fisherman from Chiiron trooped down to the beach one fine morning,<br>
he found a very peculiar prize.  A tiny sprite, no more than two feet<br>
tall, with bluish skin and bright green hair was caught in a long tangle<br>
of fishing line, and a hook was imbedded in one of her little arms.  The<br>
kind fisherman bent down to untangle the sobbing little creature and took<br>
her to the temple of Taranth for healing.<br>
The wise priestess of Taranth healed the sprite's wounds and comforted<br>
her.  The little elf-like sprite told how she had become lost in the<br>
darkness while hunting for her missing school of angel fish.  After being<br>
caught in a strong current, she ended up tangled in the fishing twine and<br>
the hook had become lodged in her arm.<br>
To get her back to her colony, the priestess took the sprite to the<br>
beach near Chiiron and pointed her in a south-westerly direction.  As the<br>
sprite disappeared beneath the waves, her green hair was still visible and<br>
the priestess could see her head south-west toward the barrier reef of the<br>
Sea of Stars.<br>
