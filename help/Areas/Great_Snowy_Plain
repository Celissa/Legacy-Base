Located deep within the bowels of the Dragonspires, in an icy cavern<br>
riddled with frost, it is believed that powerful ice demons reside there. <br>
While only legend, many tell a strange tale of a dwarven army that<br>
attempted to destroy the foul beasts but failed; only one such dwarf is<br>
rumored to have survived.  These demons, supposedly led by a powerful duo<br>
of sorcerors, have been recently 'sighted,' with some even venturing to<br>
believing the sightings as a warning of the prophecied 'Age of Frost.' <br>
