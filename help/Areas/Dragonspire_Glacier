Deep in the Dragonspires lies an ancient and forgotten glacier.  Myths<br>
and legends tell of a race of ice warriors that dwell in the glacier but<br>
no reports have confirmed this.  Many travellers have attempted to<br>
venture into the glacier and have never been heard from again.  Some who<br>
have returned from the glacier to tell of a marvelous city of ice and<br>
also the beasts that protect it.  For those brave enough to venture to<br>
the glacier will find many challenges and the possibility of unheard<br>
fortunes.  All those that do attempt the trek are warned to proceed with<br>
caution as no one knows what truly lies along the path.<br>
