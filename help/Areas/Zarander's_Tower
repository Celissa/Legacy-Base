Far to the north and west of Kha-da, situated in the heart of a secluded<br>
secluded valley, rises the tower of the Wizard Zarander.  Although renown<br>
in his youth as a strong conjurer and an adventuring mage, of late no one<br>
has seen him.  Some say he has simply become a hermit, while other rumors<br>
would have you believe he was murdered by his assistant, whom people have<br>
not seen for quite some time either.  The only possible clues, if any<br>
remain, must lie within the Tower itself.<br>
