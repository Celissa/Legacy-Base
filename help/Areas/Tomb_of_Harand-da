In an age long forgotten, hordes of orcs roamed the great fields of the<br>
west, where now small human villages have come to flourish.  The orcs<br>
pillaged where they pleased, took what they wished, and grew strong and<br>
powerful as the elves roamed their forests far to the east, and the<br>
dwarves lay resting in the cold stone mountains of the north.  But the<br>
orcs grew restless, and came together in a great army intent on<br>
overthrowing the dwarven fortresses of the Cairn Mountains, even unto<br>
Kha-Da itself.  Harand-Da, the One-Handed, mighty hero of the dwarves of<br>
the line of Khedrus, First King and founder of the Clan Khedrun, rallied<br>
his dwarven kinsmen and met this great dark horde in the fields just<br>
west of the Bridge of Tears.  The battle was long and bloody, and many<br>
are the bardic tales and songs of the heros and villains who made<br>
their names with axe, hammer, and scimitar.  Finally the orcs made a<br>
final charge, breaking the ranks of the seasoned dwarves and smashing the<br>
armies of Harand-Da against the stones.  But Harand-Da would not<br>
surrender.  He too led a final charge, rallying the scattered dwarves and<br>
meeting the orc advance upon the Bridge of Tears itself.  The charge<br>
destroyed the orcs utterly, sending the few survivors that could run,<br>
fleeing back across the great fields of the west and into the deserts and<br>
barrens beyond.  Sadly, the day was not without its losses.  Scores and<br>
scores of dwarves, both old and young, fell in the victory.  Harand-Da<br>
himself took an orc spear in the heart as he stepped over a clansman who<br>
had fallen.<br>
<br>
Harand-Da was laid to rest in a place of honor in the heart of the Cairn<br>
Mountains, above the tomb of Khedrus himself.  Others who had fallen in<br>
the battle were lain as honor guards, left to rest in peace for all<br>
eternity.<br>
<br>
It is said they will only awaken when the ancient evil of the lost race<br>
of Western Orcs, the Durgoroth, returns to endanger the mighty halls of<br>
Kha-Da once again.<br>
