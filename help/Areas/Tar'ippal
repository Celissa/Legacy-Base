Starting town/ruin  and accompanying zones for dark newbies.<br>
<br>
Historians and archeoligists tell us that Tar'ippal was originally<br>
created by what they believe to be an ancient breed of dwarf which has<br>
long been extinct.  After the destruction of the old continent and the<br>
relocation of the races, this city was assimiliated by the goblins who<br>
were the first to find it.  They instantly fell in love wth the hot tar<br>
pits that flow through the caverns once mined by the ancient dwarven<br>
peoples.  They quickly named the town Tar'ippal and will now fight for<br>
it, if it ever came to that.  One black-skinned goblin was overheard<br>
stating that the tar has done wonders for its skin.  Though one look at<br>
him, any sane person would say otherwise.<br>
