Nestled in a valley just to the southwest of Dun Tathaig, the Curahl<br>
Ranch has built a reputation over the years of providing the highest<br>
quality food products to the local villages and towns.  Currently run by<br>
Garan Curahl and his family, the farm is open to friendly travelers who<br>
wish to purchase their wares or just rest their weary bones.<br>
