Among the wild lands south of Medienne, a massive, forbidding fortress<br>
looms above the swamps, looking out over the nearby Northern Sea.  Flying<br>
from the highest parapet of the fortress, a black banner stirs in the<br>
wind; the battle standard of Ri'lahl.  A silver octagon inscribed upon<br>
the midnight silk of the standard embraces an argent falcon, positioned<br>
to strike.  The embroidered raptor's eyes seem to watch the land around<br>
it, wary of any potential enemy.<br>
