A place of great beauty and mystery, the ancient forest known as the<br>
Vaasa is home to some unique and magical creatures.  With its towering<br>
Shuvana trees and being rife with forest life, anyone who ventures around<br>
would fall in awe of its splendor.  Rumors insist that the llewyrr make<br>
their home around the area.<br>
<br>
The Woodworms (level 8-20)<br>
  <br>
The woodworms are a well-known and much feared menace of the Vaasa. <br>
Their depredations are responsible for the death of several venerable<br>
shuvana trees.  Though feared for the swathe of destruction they can<br>
cause, slowly devouring tree after tree, many elves have taken it upon<br>
themselves to champion the cause of the woodworms' downfall.  With<br>
vigilance and constant hard work, the elves have managed to keep the<br>
destruction of the woodworms at a standstill.  Should you seek to join<br>
these noble guardians of the woods in defending the Vaasa, then ask any<br>
llewyrr in that vast woods, and they will probably be able to lead you to<br>
the very spot where this battle against this foe is waged.<br>
<br>
The ancient elven city of Vaasa lies deep within the heart of the forest. <br>

WARNING: Rumors persist that the vaasan elves hold little welcome to<br>
those of non-elven heritage unless they are accompanied by an elf, are an<br>
ent or have joined the Shuvana Guard.  Whispers speak of jails and dank<br>
pits well on the edge of elven influence.<br>
