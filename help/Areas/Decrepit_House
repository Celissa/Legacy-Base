Strange tales of frog like creatures concealed in a new stronghold to the<br>
south-east of Lag are being whispered by merchants and travellers alike. <br>
Merchants now refuse to travel near the place due to their carts being<br>
ransacked and merchants devoured by these monsters.  Allegations of these<br>
powerful beings having journeyed from distant lands, seeking new nations<br>
to be conquered.  As time goes by the creatures have time to grow in<br>
strength and number and to spread across the land like a plague.<br>
