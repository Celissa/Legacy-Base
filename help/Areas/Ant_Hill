The grasslands east of Chiiron have long had a problem with a colony of<br>
giant ants.  These ants, which are rumored to often be the size of large<br>
dogs, have a series of tunnels which several adventurers have reported<br>
lead deep beneath the earth.  Somewhere in there must live the ant queen<br>
as the colony shows no signs of dying.<br>
