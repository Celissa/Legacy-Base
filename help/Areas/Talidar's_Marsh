Talidar's name for the swamp was originally the swamp of the blue waders,<br>
however since he was the only one from the new township that seemed to<br>
spend any time within its muddy waters the swamp quickly became known as<br>
Talidar's marsh.  Years of farming and road building have almost<br>
quartered the swamp's size from the days of Talidar's wanderings.  These<br>
days the little corner of wetland plays home to the blue-feathered waders<br>
that use the swamp for food, shelter and nesting grounds.  Rumours abound<br>
that Talidar hid a large sum of treasure somewhere in the marsh, marking<br>
its spot with a rune that a careful observer may spot.  In all the years<br>
of the township's existence no one has managed to find the fabled<br>
treasure, some putting it down to myth and others to Talidar's cunning.<br>
