Well before the dwarven migration from the Everwinter Mountains, before<br>
even Talidar reached the elven lands, an ancient city thrived on the<br>
banks of the Ice Wash river.  They used the grains and animals of their<br>
fertile surroundings to grow rich and transformed their city to one of<br>
stone and steel.  Aggressive expansionists, they pushed outward and<br>
dominated the nearby tribal factions, demanding sacrifices and tributes<br>
from them.  As their technology grew so did their cruelty.  So many blood<br>
sacrifices were paid that they attracted the notice of the trio of dark<br>
gods.  Their blessings enabled the city to control an ever larger<br>
territory until they reached near to the dwarven lands.  War ensued;<br>
bloody and brutal it took a great toll on both sides, weakening both<br>
until they stood poised at the brink of ruin.  The city under the<br>
influence of the dark gods built a grand abbey to the gods in a hope to<br>
win favour and win the war.<br>
<br>
Before it was quiet complete the last great host that the dwarves could<br>
muster descended upon the city.  For the first time the dwarves were<br>
aided by a handful of elven rangers, the cooperated finally overwhelming<br>
the forces of the city.  As its people fell to the onslaught, the priests<br>
and sorcerers falling back to the abbey where they made their final stand<br>
defiant to the last, without mercy the combined army killed them all<br>
their bodies burn within the dark abbeys walls, the flames they said<br>
turning black as the high priest was consumed.<br>
<br>
Despite the efforts of both elven and Dwarven priest the land around<br>
where the abbey was constructed refused the consecrations of the light<br>
gods, remaining tainted by the will of Taraskatt.  The elves and dwarfs<br>
tore down the rest of the city, replanting the and with forest and grass,<br>
leaving only the blackened cemetery of the abbey standing.  The dwarven<br>
nation retreated into its holds; weakened by the wars the goblins had<br>
started to take their strongholds, overrunning the isolated clan houses. <br>
Some say the gobliniods were aided in part by the dark gods in revenge<br>
for the fall of their great city.  A great sickness fell upon both the<br>
races, the elven priests were able to contain much of the plague but the<br>
unfortunate dwarves died in horrific numbers, often entire communities<br>
were lost.<br>
<br>
Not content with his ruination of the land Taraskatt rose up the dead,<br>
infusing them with death and disease.  With this undead army he rebuilt<br>
the abbey using its graveyards with a tireless supply of builders.<br>
