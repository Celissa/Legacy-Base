A recent gnomish scouting party to the southern reaches of Sos-Kul is<br>
reported missing by the council of Thorstag.  Due back weeks ago, the<br>
party's last report states that they were entering a large clearing in<br>
the forest.  The party never made it to Sos-Kul: they were apparently<br>
killed by some unseen foe.<br>
     <br>
The Gnomish Government has released this exert from the final report<br>
received from the scouting party: <br>
    <br>
Day 1<br>
We have found an entrance into the strange clearing yesterday and have<br>
spent the night just inside the vast opening.  We will rest for the night<br>
after an altercation with a strange group of frog men.  We plan on<br>
sending a small group deeper in tomorrow.  If this group is successful we<br>
will map the area and continue on to Sos-Kul.<br>
     <br>
Day 2<br>
The small party we sent into the clearing has not returned.  The clearing<br>
is completely free from the elements.  The canopy that covers it provides<br>
us shelter from the brutal weather of the swamp.  We plan on going in<br>
after the initial party this afternoon and then continue on to Sos-Kul.<br>
