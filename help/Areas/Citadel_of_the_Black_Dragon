Near the war-ravaged city of Medienne, deep in the heart of its darkest<br>
woods, rises a citadel of evil.  A dark mist shrouds the tower from afar,<br>
while up close it is evident that a mighty thunderstorm rages atop the<br>
dark granite walls of the citadel.  A great dark shape can sometimes be<br>
seen in the sky, but if that is fact or rumor no one knows for certain. <br>
A small force of dark knights, clerics, and wizards guard the secrets of<br>
the citadel.  Not many lost adventurers who find themselves within the<br>
citadel return to see the light of day.  It is said that the guardians of<br>
the citadel possess the power of its chief evil, as if it possesses each<br>
of them.<br>
