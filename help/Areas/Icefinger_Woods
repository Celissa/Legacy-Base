Nestled against the southern peaks of the Everwinter range, Icefinger<br>
Woods was named by the first humans who encountered the aloof tribe of<br>
wood elves living amongst the trees.  The elves called the woods<br>
Il'fanidin, which roughly translates into 'woods at the edge of the great<br>
ice'.  Some hundred years later, unexplained changes began to grip the<br>
woods; the forest's heart became dark and twisted, and the ancient trees<br>
became draped with web and tangling vines.  What became of the wood elves<br>
no one knows, and those who dared enter the woods disappeared; rarely, a<br>
desicated husk would be found upon the roadway, but most often nothing<br>
was seen again of the hapless adventurers.<br>
