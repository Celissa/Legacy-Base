There have been tales told through the ages of an ancient magic cast an<br>
eon ago during a time of trouble...during a time when the elves wandered<br>
all the lands of the world and a primitive evil arose to contest their<br>
sovereignty.  This arcane evil held great power and ravaged the world at<br>
will, its other inhabitants fleeing in terror before it.  Then came a<br>
time when the mages of the world gathered together.  Using the great<br>
stones to portal from place to place, they cast powerful magics, sealing<br>
the various realms away in safety.  Ages passed and the magics began to<br>
fade.  The world recovered and the realms were unsealed, one area at a<br>
time, until all but a few were revealed.  Civilization once again began<br>
to thrive.<br>
<br>
Recently, whispers of ancient chantings have been heard...or rumored to<br>
have been heard...west of Chiiron, and a twisting trail leading northward<br>
has been revealed.  What lies beyond is a mystery, as few have yet dared<br>
to brave the unknown.<br>
