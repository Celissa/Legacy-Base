Deep within the heart of the Dragonspire Mountains lies a crumbling,<br>
shattered keep.  Within the bowels of this once mighty keep lies a sleeping<br>
evil, a cold darkness native to the icy reaches of the Dragonspires.  The<br>
keep itself was ripped from its true home centuries ago and placed here by<br>
the beast, and now is inhabited by strange goblins with white skin, as<br>
large as men.  The road to the keep is long and treacherous, as the<br>
legendary yeti await the unwary trespasser, and tales of giant,<br>
flesh-devouring worms which burrow into the snow abound from the few<br>
adventurers who return from a journey to the keep.  Fragile ice bridges and<br>
caves inhabited by fearsome, giant bats abound, and the snow is endless.<br>
Let adventurers beware the wrath of the creatures which make their fell<br>
homes near the Shattered Keep in the Dragonspires.<br>
