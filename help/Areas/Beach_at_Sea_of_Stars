East of Chiiron is a beach filled with golden sand.  The region is<br>
teeming with wildlife, and some of the sea creatures there are highly<br>
regarded for the tasty food they can provide.  The beach makes for both a<br>
good hunting ground for new adventurers, as well as a pleasant place to<br>
relax and soak in the atmosphere.<br>
