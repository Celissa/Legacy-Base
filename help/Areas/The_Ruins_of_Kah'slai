With the opening of Calidar's Harbour many new travelers have managed to<br>
make the arduous journey to the new world, leaving Dulthor's Hold<br>
sometimes never to return.  As the new lands are explored further some of<br>
their ancient history has begun to resurface.  One such site is the ruins<br>
of the elven city of Kah'slai.  The city once stood across the high<br>
cliffs of the southern coast but years of abandonment and the<br>
ever-consuming sea has torn much of the ruins down, leaving the<br>
water-swamped remains for brave explorers to reclaim.<br>
