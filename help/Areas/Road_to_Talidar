Carved from the lands by the combined effort of the dwarves and human<br>
settlers, the roadway links the southern sea with the great cities to the<br>
west.  At one time a bustling trade of exotic pelts ivory and precious<br>
gems was rushed up and down by heavily armored caravans, now it appears<br>
that the traders have left or at least found safer ways to export the<br>
riches of the new world.  Dust and countless bugs and birds are all that<br>
accompany a would-be traveler on his or her journey these days.<br>
