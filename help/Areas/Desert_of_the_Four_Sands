Endurus, a gnomen geomancer, recently returned from the far west.  While<br>
looking for his father, an adventurer who disappeared over two hundred<br>
years ago, Endurus was trapped in a landslide.  Once he freed himself, he<br>
soon discovered a path which led through a twisting canyon into a vast<br>
desert.  Excited that he had finally found the Desert of the Four Sands,<br>
Endurus, like his father before him, struck out on a mission of<br>
exploration, leaving his magical studies behind for a time.<br>
<br>
Sadly, when Endurus returned from the desert, he returned with little<br>
additional knowledge about his father's disappearance.  However, Endurus<br>
did discover that what his father called the 'Desert of the Four Sands'<br>
was truly the Naraki Desert.  Apparently a minor earthquake had sealed it<br>
off from the rest of the main continent.<br>
<br>
Endurus also learned why his father's journals spoke of the Naraki as<br>
having four sands.  For indeed, within the Naraki Desert, a barren land<br>
caught within a series of twisted canyons, Endurus found that the desert<br>
soils were of four different colors.<br>
<br>
Each, Endurus discovered, had its own secrets and mysteries that need be<br>
unearthed.  But the most spectacular thing about his visit, he has been<br>
heard to remark, was the giant stone structure situated in the middle of<br>
the desert.  Though he could find no way into the structure, Endurus has<br>
vowed one day to return.  Perhaps, within it, lie clues to his father's<br>
whereabouts.<br>
