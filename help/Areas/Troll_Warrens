Hidden away underground for many years, the cave troll clan of Nethr'arak<br>
has long prospered in the soft limestone caves they called home.  Raids<br>
upon the surface were not uncommon, yet they were not frequent by any<br>
standards.<br>
<br>
At least until recently.<br>
<br>
Travellers from Medienne to Denab-Khur have found bloodstains upon the<br>
Great North Road and have found some few personal effects of an ill-fated<br>
merchant caravan.  The Watchers of Voaleth have also reported some<br>
missing persons and scenes of combat without any bodies.<br>
<br>
Rumors abound about a new chieftess that has given the clan a new<br>
purpose, about a new breed of troll that breathes fire, and also that<br>
they are taller than frost giants.<br>
<br>
Be wary, traveller, for there are worse things in the night than<br>
pickpockets, and yet beware of rumors that could play you false and<br>
separate the fool from his money.<br>
