Deep in the heart of the Vaasa, near a forgotten stream, a few families<br>
of elves have built a small village to live their lives in peace and<br>
harmony with nature.  Three generations of families live together,<br>
hunting, fishing, and enjoying a simple, quiet life.  While the stone<br>
giants of Hark's Finger loom nearby, the elves have thus far been able to<br>
leave in peace.<br>
