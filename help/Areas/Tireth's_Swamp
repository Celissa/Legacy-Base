A great evil has begun to make its presence known in the area just north of<br>
Sos-Kul.  The harbinger of this news is the wife of a young sage.  Relanya<br>
has been seen around Medienne spreading news of the death of her husband,<br>
Tireth.  Rumors of a dark infernalist summoning armies of demons to act as<br>
the forward attack on all of the races of the world have begun to circulate<br>
through the cliques of those that practice the dark arts.  Combined with<br>
these rumors are the reports of a young lizardman hunter, the fierce and<br>
dreaded k'sskians, which have been thought extinct for generations, have<br>
returned to the world.<br>
