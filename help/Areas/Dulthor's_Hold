Perched on the edge of a great bay that lies far to the north of Kha-da,<br>
the quaint village of Dulthor's Hold takes its name from the old wizard<br>
who constructed the nearby watchtower.  Originally designed to give<br>
Kha-da forewarning of sea attacks by orc raiders and gnoll marauders, the<br>
ancient structure has become the focal point of several peoples.  Tall<br>
seafaring humans of the far north have created a small township around<br>
the base of the tower, trading gems, foodstuffs and magics for iron<br>
weapons and scholarly objects.  The importance of a deep bay that allows<br>
sizable ships to berth has ensured the steady growth of the village. <br>
Despite the mist-shrouded nature of the coast, the inhabitants are often<br>
described as warm and open, unlike the suspicious demeanor that clings to<br>
the inland folk.<br>
