There have been reports of odd tremors in the earth's surface, deep<br>
within the Cairn Mountains, not far from Kha-da.  A dwarven corpse was<br>
found lying in the snow to the north and west of the city, half its body<br>
eaten away and covered in a thick layer of green slime.  Those sent to<br>
investigate the strange occurrences report immense snake-like creatures<br>
burrowing into the snow near the site of the unfortunate dwarf. <br>
Strange-looking holes have been tunneled through the snow and deep into<br>
the stone of the old mountain.<br>
