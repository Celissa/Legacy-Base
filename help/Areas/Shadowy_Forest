Resting above a cliff near the beach close to Chiiron is a large shadowy<br>
forest that overlooks the expansive Sea of Stars.  This vast forest was<br>
once home to several forest gnomes who enjoyed a peaceful trade with the<br>
neighboring sea sprites and humans of Chiiron.  Several years ago,<br>
though, the gnomes were seen fleeing the forest, battered and bloodied by<br>
a large battle with a clan of evil dark faeries.  These faeries claimed<br>
the forest their own as part of their new kingdom.  Upon finding out<br>
about the neighboring sea sprites, the faeries quickly began building an<br>
army because, in their eyes, these sprites were nothing more than a<br>
nuisance.  Soon began the great faerie/sprite war which has raged for<br>
several years now.  The faeries view all other races as weak and<br>
insignificant and do not hesitate to attack any intruders in their forest.<br>
