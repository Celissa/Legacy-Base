 Stories are often told of a great mine that yielded vast quantities of<br>
gems and other wealth to the gnomes.  The mine was called the Glory Hole,<br>
and for centuries it brought great wealth to the gnomes of Orlumber.  The<br>
gnomes delved deep into the earth in search of wealth, and it seemed to<br>
some that the Glory Hole would never run out of riches.  A steady stream<br>
of gems and precious metals came from the mine.<br>
 Some tales say that something sinister happened in the mine, that the<br>
gnomes came upon and loosed a great evil deep within the bowels of the<br>
earth.  Others merely say that the mine stopped producing and was<br>
abandoned.  The truth may never be known.<br>
