A solitary rock finger reaches high into the sky, piercing the rolling<br>
green skyline of the Vaasa.  This ancient place of power, know as Hark's<br>
Finger to the Llewyrr, has become the home of a band of stone giants who<br>
occasionally roam the woods nearby capturing the unwary.  The stench of<br>
death and the carnage of slaughter, both animal and sentient beings,<br>
litters the ground near the home of these vicious giants.  Should you<br>
happen upon their lair alone, you would be wise to retreat as fast as<br>
possible lest they add you to their stew pots.<br>
