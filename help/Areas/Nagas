Long before the coming of the humans to the land, great forests covered<br>
the lowlands.  Living in amongst the dense forests were several elder<br>
races, the elves and the naga.  Although their cultures were vastly<br>
different they both respected and cherished the great forests.  The naga<br>
were far more secretive than the elves.  They built their cities below<br>
ground, in the forested hills of the Cairn Mountains.<br>
<br>
With the arrival of the humans the naga became increasingly withdrawn<br>
into their strongholds.  The naga wished to wage war on the humans, but<br>
being fewer in numbers they called on the elves for aid.  The elves<br>
however preferred to withdraw from the humans, and retreated to the Vaasa. <br>
Facing the bitter truth that they could not win a war with the humans<br>
they retreated further into places that the humans found inhospitable.<br>
<br>
Most of the areas they abandoned, although some of the younger naga<br>
refused to abandon some of the sacred sites.  The naga are incredibly<br>
long lived and have been isolated for centuries.  In this time they have<br>
lost a lot of their culture, and their civilization has fallen to a<br>
hunter-gatherer society.  The new naga are taught that these are times of<br>
and that which humans and their allies have caused the nagas great<br>
suffering.  This has made the nagas xenophobic to the point of almost<br>
open hostility towards those not of their race.<br>
<br>
In recent times the warleader of Sos-kul has tried to open negotiations<br>
with the nagas, and has sent one of his wise lizardmen to act as an<br>
ambassador.<br>
