The villagers of Sos-Kul tell a fable of how the lizardman's town was<br>
once overrun by a kingdom of Iguanas.  In an effort to take their village<br>
back, the lizardmen warred for years with the Iguanas until the Iguana<br>
monarchy was driven into the K'ssk swamp.  Rumor has it that the Iguanas<br>
might have settled to the south of Sos-Kul where they were driven.<br>
