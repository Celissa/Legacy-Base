Rumour persists of an ancient vyan city buried deep under ground, and of<br>
the riches to be found.  Generations of adventurers have wasted their<br>
lives trying to discover the whereabouts of its location to no avail. <br>
Recently more concrete evidence has been found, a party of dwarven<br>
delvers claiming to have gained access to a great ruin via a system of<br>
tunnels created by bloated and disgusting silk worms.  The dwarves<br>
themselves left shortly thereafter as adventurers are wont to do, leaving<br>
little but cryptic clues concerning a twisted and ancient tree somewhere<br>
north of calidars harbour.<br>
