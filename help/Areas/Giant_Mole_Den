It was late in the autumn when they came, nasty to the extreme and vile<br>
as the most putrid of rotting meats.  Spottings of wildlife in the<br>
decline, and reports of missing halfling folk give credible evidence to<br>
support the utter destruction that has arrived in this world.  Giant<br>
moles with teeth as sharp as razors, claws as tough as krynite, eyes as<br>
beady as...well...beads.<br>
<br>
Be wary all those that wish to tresspass into the den of the moles,<br>
for it is perilous and would surely lead to the death of all who would<br>
enter their lair.<br>
