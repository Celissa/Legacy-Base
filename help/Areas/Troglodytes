Long, long ago an ancient race dwelled within the confines of the Vaasa.<br>
What became of them, no one is certain, but they did leave behind ancient<br>
ruins.  Recent excavations of these ruins by the local Llewyrr have led to<br>
the discovery of an ancient cavern inhabbited by a feral troglodytic<br>
people.  Though the troglodytes seem to have no real tendancy towards good<br>
or evil, they are cerainly a nuisance.  Several troglodytes have managed to<br>
make it to the surface, only to pray upon animal and sentient being alike<br>
with a sheer, bestial brutatilty.  If the safety of the Vaasa is to be<br>
preserved, the noble guardians of the Vaasa will have to turn their<br>
attentions within and prevent a full uprising of these strange creatures.<br>
   <br>
The few Llewyrr that have ventured into the dark, dank layers come back<br>
with odd tales of strange sites.  After much consultation between the<br>
noble guardians, they ventured the comment that they felt the troglodyte<br>
menace could be controlled.  They felt the troglodytes served about the<br>
same threat that the woodworms posed to the denizens of the forest.<br>
