Ancient legend tells of a great land known as Tarik Nor.  The oft told<br>
tales were thought to be just rumor until recently, when a band of<br>
adventurers stumbled on a barren tunnel, leading to a deserted landscape<br>
that scholars now believe is Tarik Nor.  The land is described as a vast<br>
wasteland completely devoid of all wildlife, plants and water...nothing<br>
more then a flat, featureless plain.  Reports from several other bands of<br>
adventurers tell of a forest which lies deep inside the waste but further<br>
exploration was blocked as unseen forces seemed to push them away.<br>
Scholars and sages have researched the land deeply and have found that it<br>
was once part of a major trade route that linked Pennan, Medienne and<br>
Chiiron with exotic supplies and crafts.  The last expedition to travel<br>
into the wastes was never heard from again.  What truly lies inside the<br>
land of Tarik Nor is unknown but legends speak of a marvelous city from<br>
which riches of unbelievable magnitude were bought and sold daily.  Those<br>
wishing to travel into the land are told to seek the northeastern most<br>
section of the Dragonspire mountain range but many sages warn that the path<br>
is dangerous and death lurks around every corner in this forbidden land.<br>
