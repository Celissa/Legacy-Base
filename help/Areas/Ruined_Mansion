Far to the south and west of the city of Chiiron lie the ruins of a<br>
once-propserous mansion.  The home of a proud banker and his family, now<br>
the place only houses over-grown bugs and bats, and a few of the less<br>
savory type of the world's citizens.  What caused the fine dwelling to<br>
fall into disrepair isn't known but there are rumors of secrets and<br>
otherwordly beings inhabiting it.<br>
