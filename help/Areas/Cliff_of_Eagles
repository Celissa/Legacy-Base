This vertical cliff is a series of nearly impossible climbs to the<br>
perches and nests of various eagles.  Rumors of a giant gold-feathered<br>
bird which have come from those who frequent the area around the cliff<br>
insist it is as large as a dragon and can carry off horses with ease. <br>
But as with all rumors, who knows how reliable this one may be?<br>
