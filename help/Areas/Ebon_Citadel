Ages past...<br>
     Times change...<br>
           Heroes forgotten...<br>
<br>
Once, long ago...  Before the times of strife and distrust, the light and<br>
dark races occasionally saw past thier differences and banded together to<br>
fight common enemies.  These common enemies were numerous; most still<br>
plague the lands even today...  Frost giants, Storm giants, evil<br>
mutations of nature, rogue ogres and of course dragons.  Out of the<br>
darkness of battles, clans arose to forge ahead and protect their members. <br>
Though few allowed for the light and dark races to mingle it inevitably<br>
happened, alliances were forged and mortals gained even more power,<br>
rumors say some gained the powers of the gods themselves.<br>
<br>
Then Darkness....<br>
<br>
Though it was a time few talk about, the darkness struck out and<br>
destroyed the mortals and most of what they had built...  Though very<br>
little is all-inclusive and as such the races of the land survived. <br>
Towns were rebuilt, a new generation was born and once again battle was a<br>
way of life, no longer did the light and dark races pretend to trust each<br>
other, each instead blaming the other for the times past.  Historians<br>
have searched for the complete records of the land, but large gaps<br>
abound, seemingly the gods themselves wiped out nearly all knowledge of<br>
the past generation of heroes.<br>
<br>
Rumors have begun to surface that the dark and deadly Cult of Xharax<br>
have found and claimed an ancient stronghold of power as their own. <br>
Coupled with this rumor are the acts of an aging member of the Medienne<br>
guard, his claim that he was actually alive before the darkness came is<br>
dubious at best.  This gentleman recently posted a note in the Rusty<br>
Nail, stating that it was actually from a young elf who has not walked<br>
the human lands in some time, this has been wholly disbelieved by the<br>
general populace.<br>
