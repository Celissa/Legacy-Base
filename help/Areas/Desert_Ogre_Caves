Centuries ago when the land of Tarik Nor was being invaded by the demons<br>
of the Abyss, several bands of ogres fled into underground caverns to<br>
escape their wrath.  To the ogres surprise the demons found them;<br>
however, before the demons had a chance to slay them, the band of desert<br>
ogres stepped forth and offered them a deal.  It is said that in exchange<br>
for god-like powers and their lives the desert ogres would seek out<br>
anything that was good left in the land and slay them.  Legends tell that<br>
the demons accepted the deal and granted the ogres incredible strength,<br>
agility and weapons of great power to further their cause.  Recently a<br>
band of adventurers surveying the Black Wastes came across a cave in<br>
which they found the legendary ogres.  Very few escaped with their lives<br>
but those who did tell of the horrors found within the caves.  They also<br>
spoke of the riches which the ogres accumulated over the years.<br>
