Orlumber is the great city of the Gnomes, and is located somewhere in the<br>
Black Hills far to the north of Pennan and the Rua Valley.  Once closely<br>
tied to the humans in Pennan and the Rua Valley, and known for its crafts<br>
and trade, Orlumber has recently lost contact with much of the outside<br>
world.<br>
