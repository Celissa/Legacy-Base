Not for the faint of heart, these plains are populated by savage beasts. <br>
Lions await to make you their prey, while rhinos and elephants guard<br>
their territory.  In this untamed wild, it is survival of the fittest.<br>
The plains lie to the distant northwest, almost unto the great deserts.<br>
