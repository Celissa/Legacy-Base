Bugbears, a tall humanoid race of carnivors are known to dwell in the<br>
caves that riddle the ground between Chiiron and Kha-Da.  In past times<br>
they would sweep out of the caves and raid the village of Chiiron,<br>
carrying off the unwary to be placed in the soup-pots.  A hardy band of<br>
adventurers claims to have solved the problem, stating that with some<br>
luck the bugbears will soon die of starvation, unable to escape the<br>
predicament the adventurers left them in.  Should you come across a<br>
bugbear, be extremely cautious as they will be hungry and have no<br>
compunctions about eating you.<br>
