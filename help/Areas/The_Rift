An innocent was slain, and as her life's blood poured onto the stones on<br>
which she lay, a terrible curse was cast, and a rift opened linking this<br>
world to the underworld.  Hordes of evil ghosts and wraiths press<br>
forward, sensing the passage, hungering to escape into the living world. <br>
The spirit of the innocent herself guards the rift, but who knows when<br>
she might fall?<br>
