From the mists of recorded time brownies, known to locals as fynns,<br>
inhabited this quiet, forested area.  Over the ages, different groups of<br>
explorers, usually miners and loggers, entered the seemingly empty forest. <br>
The fynns set traps to drive out intruders such as these and occasionally<br>
there would be disappearances of an explorers, or team of explorers. <br>
Nixies, also known as the aillse, are female water bound brownies that<br>
live in the lake that borders the quiet woodlands where the fynns dwell. <br>
The two groups, fynn and aillse, join together to drive intruders from<br>
their private world.<br>
