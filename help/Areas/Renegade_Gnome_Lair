The long-suffering citizens of Pennan have been weary of raids and<br>
surprise attacks from ferocious invaders for many years.  Among the worst<br>
culprits are a wild bunch of renegade gnomes.  These rogues and<br>
cutthroats are skilled and dangerous, combining stealth, spellcraft, and<br>
special equipment.  Rumors have been circulating that their secret lair<br>
exists somewhere north of Pennan.  Those who wish to help rid Pennan of<br>
these vile scoundrels had best be fully alert, for these gnomes are<br>
well-trained in battle and dirty fighting tactics.<br>
