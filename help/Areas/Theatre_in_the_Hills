Once thought to be deserted, the Theatre in the Hills near the town of<br>
Medienne is under new management.  Back before the theatre<br>
was closed by a lack of funding, several performers from around the world<br>
would perform there.<br>
<br>
The new manager, thought to be a rich businessman from Pennan, reportedly<br>
has thrown several hundred platinum pieces into remodeling the Theatre in<br>
the Hills from its dilapidated state into a prospering theatre house. <br>
Unfortunately, rumor has it that the theatre was so badly out of shape<br>
that his restoration fund was barely enough to open the theatre and pay<br>
for some cheap actors.<br>
