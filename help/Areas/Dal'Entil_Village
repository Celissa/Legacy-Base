Recently, an upheaval in the stability of the Cairn Mountains caused a<br>
minor avalanche.  When the dust and rubble cleared, a crevice was opened<br>
through the cliff face that lies in the far north beyond Kha-da.  Those<br>
sent to investigate, report that the crevice is passable and opens onto a<br>
wilderness trail leading beyond the mountain's heights.  No one has, as<br>
yet, investigated what lies at the other end of the trail, but ancient<br>
legends speak of a valley hidden deep with the Cairns away from mortal<br>
ken.<br>
