In an old abandoned mine shaft near Voaleth, explorers have found a cavern<br>
with a huge door set into the north wall.  Finely wrought of mithril and<br>
steel, the door was unable to be opened.  Upon hearing of this find,<br>
Tsarith, Master Sage of Voaleth, sent word to Etrahnin of Pennan.  A codex<br>
Tsarith had translated only days before told of an entombed force of guards<br>
protecting the final resting place of their nobles.  Perhaps, this door is<br>
the entrance to the tomb.  Only the sages know what lies beyond.<br>
