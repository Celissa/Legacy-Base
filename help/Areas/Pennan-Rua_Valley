Beside the Pennan hills is the lush green valley which they overlook. <br>
Rich with wildlife, this area also provides fertile ground for<br>
domesticated animals to feed upon.  The region is also famous for<br>
legendary monsters as well as wandering thieves and cutthroats.<br>
<br>
Mercenary Cave (level 12)<br>
<br>
Far north of the Greened Way lies a hidden and well-guarded limestone<br>
cave.  A small band of goblin mercenaries currently resides there. <br>
Although not usually very bright, these mercenaries are known to be<br>
stubborn, vicious fighters.<br>
