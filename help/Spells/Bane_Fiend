Summons a lesser demon to serve the caster.  One of the foot soliders of<br>
the dark gods, the creature can smite foes with both blade and spell. <br>
Such a powerful demon requires great control and only with the correct<br>
sacrifies can it be called forth.  Upon the mortal realm the fiend<br>
appears as a smoke-shrouded troll with giant bat-like wings.  At times<br>
when summoned, the creature will be wielding a flaming scourge.  It is<br>
not possible to control a fiend and other demonic/undead pets, so any<br>
existing pets must first be destroyed before attempting this evocation. <br>
The animated skull watch does not count as either for this spell.<br>
