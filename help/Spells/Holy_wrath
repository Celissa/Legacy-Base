Holy wrath incites a character into a righteous rage increasing their<br>
ability to inflict damage on their enemies.  The caster can only<br>
successfully incite someone who is of the same alignment.  The skill<br>
level of the caster determines the duration, and might later determine<br>
the strength.<br>
