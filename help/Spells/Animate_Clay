An extremely potent spell, Animate Clay allows a cleric to call upon the<br>
powers of his or her deity to create a spirit to assist the cleric in his<br>
or her worldly duties.  A cleric may have but one such servant at a time,<br>
and the casting of such a spell is a difficult and costly cast. <br>
Nevertheless, Clay Golems are tireless followers and fearsome opponents. <br>
Indeed, certain clerics have been known to use them as bodyguards and<br>
guardians of sacred shrines or treasures.<br>
