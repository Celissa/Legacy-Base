A spell that uses many of the same principles that See Invisible uses, it<br>
is different in that it quickly bypasses the space/time dimension.  No<br>
physical object is required for this spell, merely the name of the<br>
creature that you seek information about.  It continues to prove that<br>
there is much power that lies in a name.  Once the spell is complete, the<br>
caster receives a vision of the area where the target is located.<br>
