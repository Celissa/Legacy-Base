An enchantment of substantial power, this spell harnesses the caster's<br>
magical energies and the properties of the rare mandrake root to imbue<br>
the caster with increased strength.  Even the meekest of mages will<br>
suddenly find himself to be a more formidable physical specimen, so long<br>
as the flow of magical energy which supports the spell remains unchecked.<br>
