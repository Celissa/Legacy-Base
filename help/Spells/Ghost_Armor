The spell calls upon the dark spirits to protect their ward from physical<br>
and magical damage.  A ghostly armor surrounds the target, increasing<br>
their ability to absorb damage.  Although not an evil spell, the spirits<br>
are often reluctant to impart their protection on those whose ethos does<br>
not match their own.<br>
