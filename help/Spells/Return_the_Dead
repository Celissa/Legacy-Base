The second of a sorcerer's pets, this spell replaces the skeleton<br>
summoned, with Summon Cadaver with a greater skeleton who can follow<br>
reasonable commands and assist its master in battle.  It can even act as<br>
a beast of burden.  When summoned, the creature is often armed with<br>
weapons and shield, greatly increasing its combat efficency <br>
