Sanctify is used to imbue a weapon or armor with the power of a deity. <br>
The effect is to cause the object to degrade more slowly - it<br>
approximately doubles its lifetime.  The level of the caster determines<br>
how good of a weapon or armor he/she can sanctify.  The scrolls of<br>
sanctify are of fairly low level and are thus unable to sanctify the<br>
better weapon or armors.<br>
