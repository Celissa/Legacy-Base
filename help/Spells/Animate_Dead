With their intimate knowledge of the spells which restore life, clerics<br>
can call on the power of their gods to reanimate a corpse to the caster's<br>
will.  This corpse will remain under the caster's will only so long as<br>
the caster's power is infused into it.  It is fearless of its wounds,<br>
though it lacks the ability to recover from them.  This is an evil spell,<br>
favored generally by those to whom involvement with the dead is no great<br>
moral quandry.<br>
  <br>
All undead created in this fashion are chaotic evil.  Infer what you will.<br>
