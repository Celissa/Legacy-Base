This cleric spell, learned very early in one's career, invokes the<br>
blessing of the cleric's deities upon the target of the spell, whether<br>
that target be the cleric himself or some other ally of the cleric.  The<br>
blessing, while in effect, will increase the chance that one has to hit<br>
one's enemies while in physical combat.<br>
