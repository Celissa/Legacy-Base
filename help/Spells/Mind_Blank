The long path of dark arts teaches the sorcerer ultimate control over<br>
body and mind.  In preparation for their transformation into a lich, the<br>
caster begins by removing all emotions and fears from their mind, sealing<br>
it against intrusive thoughts.  Then once the mind is guarded, they move<br>
to the mortal flesh, pouring necromantic magic into every cell until it<br>
hardens like steel.<br>
