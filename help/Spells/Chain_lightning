An even more advanced spell than lightning bolt, chain lightning<br>
harnesses a greater amount of electrical energy to a more hazardous, and<br>
even less predictable, effect.  When discharged, chain lightning looses<br>
itself upon an area, and may strike or bounce off of all opponents in the<br>
area, including the same target multiple times.  Needless to say, a<br>
weapon harnessed with care and by only the most powerful of wizards.<br>
