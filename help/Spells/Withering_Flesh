This evocation burns a foe with unholy fire, blistering their skin and<br>
burning bone.  The black flames are called from the dark demonic planes<br>
and are powerful enough to destroy stone with their corruptive touch. <br>
Victims of the black fire find their bodies poisoned as well as badly<br>
burnt.  Despite its slowness to summon, the demonic flames are a great<br>
way for a sorcerer to announce their presence to a lesser creature.<br>
