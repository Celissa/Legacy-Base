Using the insanity of the starving beast, the sorcerer invokes a rage of<br>
hate and fury in a target.  Unable to control their aggression, they<br>
launch a furious attack upon any perceived foe.  In such a bloodlust, it<br>
is often impossible for the raging creature to defend or even flee from a<br>
battle.  Upon the spell's end, the target finds themselves incredibly<br>
hungry, requiring a bountiful meal to satisfy their cravings.<br>
