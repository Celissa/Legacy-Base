This spell attempts to transfer the subject out of danger the instance<br>
before they die.  It takes a large toll on the caster in mana and<br>
regeneration, but is very useful when entering unknown areas.  Due to its<br>
nature and the uncertainty of death this spell is difficult to get right<br>
and is often known to fail, especially when cast at lower levels.  In<br>
contrast objects with the same affect have a much lower failure rate. <br>
There is one other warning that should accompany this spell, when the<br>
victim suffers a death delivering blow and the spell successfully saves<br>
them, the energy drain from the caster can cause massive injuries.<br>
