With the upheaval of the godly pantheon, this spell, once a potent magic,<br>
has lost some of its power.  The spell mystically transports a target to<br>
the location of the caster.  Even in its weakened condition, this spell is<br>
still fairly reliable when successfully cast.  Clerics around the world are<br>
augmenting the power of their distant gods with summoning stones, thus<br>
allowing travel throughout the continent.  Research is underway regarding<br>
the possibility of finding stronger reagents to allow for trans-continental<br>
travel.<br>
<br>
Note: To be summoned by a cleric, you must be intro'd to them and<br>
have them consented.<br>
