Using shadow magic, the sorcerer invades a target's mind with terrifying<br>
nightmares which crush their sanity and inflicts a horrid suffering upon<br>
them.  Once under the effect of the mind blow, the victim is also easier<br>
to damage with other nightmare based attacks.  Like all nightmare based<br>
spells, the target must have a mind to effect, making this spell useless<br>
on elementals, some undead and similar creatures.<br>
