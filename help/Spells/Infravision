The target of this spell has his or her eyes magically enhanced to see<br>
not only the color spectrum, but also the infrared spectrum.  This<br>
pertains to the visible waves given off from heat.  Most of the time, you<br>
can make out a room, from the warmth of it's walls and furniture as<br>
opposed to it's air.  But there is a limit, and many things will<br>
obviously not give off any irregular heat.<br>
