The bite of a fire ant seems to send fire cruising though the unlucky<br>
victim's veins.  Using this spell a druid is able to call a small colony<br>
of fire ants to attack his victim though they are rather unruly and so<br>
are unabled to controlled for long.  As soon as the druid loses control<br>
the colony scatters, returning home.<br>
