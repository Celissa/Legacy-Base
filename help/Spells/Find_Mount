Paladins are long accustomed to fighting with the aid of a mount.  After<br>
many, many years of buying and training these special companions, a very<br>
skilled paladin is able to use their bond with their god to summon just<br>
the right mount.  Although a number of different reagents can be used to<br>
summon their ideal mount, a wise paladin selects the correct one without<br>
error.  From ancient lore kept by bards, the following mounts have been<br>
known to serve paladins when called upon: <br>
