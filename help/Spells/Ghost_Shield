The dark ritual summons forth a swarm of demonic spirits that enshroud a<br>
target in an angry swirl of ghostly energy.  Any creature unfortunate<br>
enough to even brush against the maddened souls feels their wraith upon<br>
them.  Due to the evil aura of the ghost shield, it is unwise to bestow<br>
their gift upon someone who follows the path of light.<br>
