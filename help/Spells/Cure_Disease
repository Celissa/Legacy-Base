By means of this spell, the caster is able to purge his or her target of<br>
disease.  One of the most common diseases this spell counteracts is the<br>
plague.<br>
<br>
*Note*<br>
Even after the plague has been cured, 'quitting' and<br>
're-entering the game' is the only way for its affects to reach their<br>
maximum potential at this time.<br>
