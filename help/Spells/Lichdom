The ultimate goal in a sorcerer's quest for power, the spell of lichdom<br>
transforms their puny flesh into the glorious form of a lich.  The<br>
weakness of life rolls away, replaced by the burning energy of undying<br>
evil.  The path to lichdom is not easy even for a true devotee of the<br>
dark gods.  Many unique items and incantations must be assembled and the<br>
evil gods must grant their humbled servant this one request.  In the form<br>
of a lich, a sorcerer quickly regains staggering amounts of magical<br>
energies.  It goes without saying that such a powerful evil will find<br>
little welcome in all but the darkest townships across the lands.<br>
