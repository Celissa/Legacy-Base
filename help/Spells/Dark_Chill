Releasing waves of cold, the sorcerer attempts to destroy a foe with a<br>
chilling strike.  The first spell in a sorcerer's damage field, it serves<br>
to strike down lesser creatures who dare disturb their dark musings. <br>
The unpredictable energies from beyond the grave require a reasonable<br>
amount of control; a crystal wand acts as a focus for this spell.<br>
