With this spell you can divine and probe the enchantments (if there are<br>
any), upon an object.  Many times it can accuratly define attributes of<br>
said object.  It is not perfect though, and some ancient or very powerful<br>
magics may block this spell, or avoid the spell altogether.  In this way,<br>
magic can be a royal pain in the butt.  <br>
