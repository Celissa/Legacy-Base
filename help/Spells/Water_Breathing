The ability to breathe underwater without the aid of magical equipment is<br>
something which rangers are able to learn as they become intimate with<br>
the powers of nature.  In fact, some learn this magical spell so well<br>
they are able to imbue others with this ability for a short period of<br>
time.<br>
