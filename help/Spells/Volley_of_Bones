Sends forth a hail of bone spikes that impale any creature unfortunate<br>
enough to be in their path.  As well as inflicting physical damage, the<br>
spikes snare and catch, causing victims to slow and fight with reduced<br>
effectivness.  Just for good measure there is a chance that the vile<br>
spikes contain poison and disease.<br>
