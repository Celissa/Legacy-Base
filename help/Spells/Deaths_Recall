Death is no mans friend, but he still may come.  This spell was developed<br>
to retrieve their corpse and what ever valuables left with in it.  This<br>
simplic version, of what it may come, allows a sorcerer to retrive the<br>
body any willing to consent to his will to him.  His range on this spell<br>
is very small.<br>
