This spell summons from the grave a hovering skull that enhances the<br>
sorcerer's magical and physical prowess.  Although of low intelligence,<br>
the skull can follow simple orders from its master.  Like undead pets, it<br>
is wise not to take the floating skull into townships that frown upon the<br>
dark arts.<br>
