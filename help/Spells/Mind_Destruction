Taking physcal form, this nightmare spell attacks the mind and body of a<br>
target in a relentless onslaught of terror and pain.  Even if the target<br>
survives the claws of the creature, they are often so exhausted by the<br>
attack that they fall victim to the next wave of sorcerer might.  As the<br>
creature exists in a quasi-real way it can inflict damage to mindless<br>
creatures.<br>
