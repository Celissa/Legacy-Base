Find familiar is the mid-level spell which allows a mage to find just the<br>
perfect beast to meld with.  It can be successfully cast once per the<br>
mage's level and a mage can only have one familiar at any given time. <br>
The familiar must be attracted by a specific type of reagent, and vary<br>
based upon the mage's alignment.<br>
 <br>
Familiars are not always as strong as many pets, but the mage has the<br>
ability to view and act through its eyes, making them good scouts.  They<br>
can also be used to get into small areas.  Also, some familiars are<br>
highly magical, and bestow magical abilities upon their master when with<br>
them.  When switched, a familiar suffers the same penalties as its mage<br>
would.<br>
 <br>
To switch into your famliar, the command is switch.  To return to<br>
your body, the command is return.<br>
 <br>
Possible familiars for good-aligned mages are:<br>
ulannu jays, giant white rabbits, white cats, fades, white riding horses,<br>
woodworm adults, war dogs, mother eagles, white stags, and motes.<br>
<br>
Neutral mages may bond with:<br>
moose, giant brown rabbits, tabby cats, brown bears, grey wolves, riding<br>
horses, psuedo-dragons, giant preying mantises, adult white-tailed<br>
eagles, and stags.<br>
<br>
Evil-aligned mages may choose from:<br>
twisted foxes, wasps, bone bears, twisted wolves, black riding horses,<br>
screech owls, mountain lions, giant bats, rabid dogs, or ornacs.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
By the time a mage reaches the level of being able to find their perfect<br>
familiar, they should know these beasts well enough to know what is<br>
likely to attract them.<br>
