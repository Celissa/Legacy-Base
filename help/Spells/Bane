An advanced curse that lays ruin to a victim's attack effectiveness,<br>
speed, damage, and ablity to defend themselves.  Since the source of the<br>
curse is demonic, it is able to effect unliving and undead creatures. <br>
Bane is often used by a sorcerer to initiate combat as its casting time is<br>
often too lengthy for the blur of melee.<br>
