This simple, utilitarian spell is actually a form of hypnosis.  By<br>
speaking an ancient phrase in a soothing voice while holding out one's<br>
hands in a gesture of amicability, many attacking monsters will stop<br>
attacking.  Some monsters, though, will realize that the caster is<br>
attempting to trick them into relaxing, and refuse to succumb to the<br>
charm.<br>
