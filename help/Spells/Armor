This spell calls upon the gods to protect the target.  An unseen aura of<br>
sorts englobes the target, and for the duration of the spell, the<br>
target's armor class is lowered, blunting some of the damage taken from<br>
attacks.  Of course, the gods have many followers and cannot mollycoddle<br>
every one of them, so this spell, while useful, will not make the<br>
beneficiary of the spell invulnerable.<br>
