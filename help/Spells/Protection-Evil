Devout souls who worship good gods are able to learn to protect<br>
themselves better from evil foes.  This spell may also be cast upon<br>
others of good alignments to shield them from the blows of evil opponents. <br>
Those of neutral or evil alignments will receive no benefit from this<br>
spell.  Protection vs Evil can only be learned by lawful good paladins.<br>
