A powerful spell said to be the creation of a group of Vyan magi who<br>
dabbled in arts best left untouched.  This spell, however, was one of<br>
their more successful creations and did not bring about their ultimate<br>
(and quite painful) demise.  When cast, Blink "teleports" the caster away<br>
from his present position to a nearby locale.  The proficiency of the<br>
caster determines the distance of the transfer, with the most powerful of<br>
magi able to use this spell to move several areas away from an enemy or<br>
potential harm.<br>
