A spell of no insignificant power, replicate allows the mage to harness<br>
the mystical elements of the world to create an exact duplicate of a<br>
specific item in his or her possession.  Through great effort and<br>
concentration, the mage is able to bring forth matter where previously<br>
there was none, and to bend unseen forces to his will.  The item copied<br>
needs to be of a simple, nonmagical nature, and failure is always<br>
possible.  A utility spell for experienced magi.<br>
