Devout souls who worship evil gods are able to learn to protect<br>
themselves better from good foes.  This spell may also be cast upon<br>
others of evil alignments to shield them from the blows of good opponents. <br>
Those of neutral or good alignments will receive no benefit from this<br>
spell.  Protection vs Good can only be learned by lawful evil<br>
paladins. <br>
