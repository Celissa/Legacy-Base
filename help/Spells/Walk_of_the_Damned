Calls forth a greater undead to serve its master, the powerful summoning<br>
returns a ghostly warrior to fight for the sorcerer.  A fiendishly<br>
complex invocation is required that has unpredictable results for those<br>
who have not fully mastered the path of the dead.  Like all undead pets,<br>
guards of good-aligned towns will not hesitate to attack the walking<br>
damned.  Whether they can kill it is another thing.<br>
