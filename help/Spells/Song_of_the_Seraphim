Many legends surround this song.  Some say long ago one of Khephera's<br>
first bladedancers traveled all the way to the heavens to hear the<br>
seraphim sing, and wrote the song of the seraphim capturing the calm<br>
beauty of their song.  Others say that one day a bladedancer was walking<br>
near the site of present day Zirnath when a passing seraphim heard his<br>
song.  The seraphim came down to the bladedancer and infused some of<br>
itself with the song.  What ever the history of the song the affects are<br>
the same, those that hear it are filled with a great calm and energy.<br>
