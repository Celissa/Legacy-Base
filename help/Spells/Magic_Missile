This is probably the first, and certainly the most basic offensive spell<br>
a young spellcaster learns.  With a great deal of concentration, the<br>
caster uses the substance of a pebble to form a missile of pure energy,<br>
which can then be hurled at an opponent to do some substantial damage. <br>
This spell is often used to train apprentices to focus their power, and<br>
the experience gained from this can lead to more complex, powerful spells.<br>
