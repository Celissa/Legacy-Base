The first offensive pet in a sorcerers spell list, this incantation uses<br>
the black arts to summon an undead minion to serve the sorcerer. <br>
Reasonable at combat, the undead does its best to follow simple<br>
instructions.  This spell can be used in conjunction with skull watch. <br>
As with all undead pets, a wise sorcerer avoids certain townships when<br>
leading a pack of dead.<br>
<br>
The skeletal minion is rumored to be summoned with a simple polished bone<br>
shard.<br>
