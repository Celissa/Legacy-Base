This quick and simple spell is taught to all tyros pursuing the magical<br>
arts, as it is a very useful spell for adventuring.  Originally it was<br>
developed by a mage in the northern mountains several centuries ago as a<br>
focus exercise for his young students.  As a reward for the correct<br>
casting of the spell, they then had a light by which to study without<br>
wasting the time meddling with a lamp or other mundane light source.<br>
<br>
At each spell level there will be a random chance to create a light of a<br>
higher level value.  For example, at level ten, you'll have a random<br>
chance to create white lights, the optimum color.<br>
