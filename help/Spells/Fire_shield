A potent spell, recently arrived to the continent from distant lands. <br>
The target of this enchantment becomes engulfed in leaping flames of<br>
burning blue and white-hot amethyst.  While he himself cannot feel the<br>
raging heat give off by this globe of crackling flame, those which try to<br>
do damage to his person must penetrate the flames in order to reach him.<br>
