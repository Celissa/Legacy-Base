This type of invisibility is passive.  Light is actually 'bent' around<br>
the target.  When you 'see', you are actually viewing rebounding light,<br>
so those that see this way, see nothing.  Be warned, those creatures that<br>
see with other means or which have other senses that are very strong,<br>
will be able to 'see' you.  <br>
