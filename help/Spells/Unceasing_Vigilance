This spell allows the cleric to designate someone to their god as a<br>
defender of others.  The 'benefit' of this spell is that if a creature<br>
decides to start a fight while a defender is present it will choose that<br>
person as its first target.  It will also wake the defender and put them<br>
in an apporpriate position at the beginning of the fight.  This spell<br>
however does not work perfectly, and sometimes things happen that<br>
shouldn't.<br>
