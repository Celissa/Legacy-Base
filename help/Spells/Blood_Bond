After years of study, a sorcerer becomes attuned to their body and mind,<br>
enabling them to convert useless health into valuable mana.  This blood<br>
bond enables the caster to harness their blood and transform it over time<br>
into faster regeneration for their mana.  It is possible for a careless<br>
sorcerer to slay themeselves by over use of the life tap.  On rare<br>
occasions, others of similar alignment can share in the feast of blood,<br>
consenting to the quickening decay of flesh for the race of raw magics.<br>
