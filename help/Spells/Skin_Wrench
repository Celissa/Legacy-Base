The first of sorcerer's warping spells, this terrible evocation causes a<br>
victim's skin and bone to twist and tear, literally ripping itself off in<br>
bloody strips.  Although it requires a living victim to be truly<br>
effective, it can do some damage to undead.  Under the agonizing effect<br>
of the spell, creatures often find it hard to fight or flee,<br>
disorientated by the extreme pain.<br>
