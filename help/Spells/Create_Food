This spell magically creates an edible object.  The standing of the<br>
caster will also determine the quality of the food produced.  Some say<br>
the food is not necessarily created, but moved from somewhere in the<br>
world to you.  The 'goody' clerics vehemently deny this, so perhaps it<br>
depends on the patron deity.  <br>
