This spell enables the person it is cast upon to understand and speak in<br>
all the languages used by mortals who populate this realm.  High-level<br>
clerics are able to cast it upon themselves in order to better spread the<br>
word of their god amongst their followers; others may occasionally find<br>
an item to help them temporarily communicate with others.<br>
