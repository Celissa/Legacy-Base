During the temperate months the bear gruffly goes about it's business of<br>
bulking itself up for long periods of hybernation.  Druids living in the<br>
colder climes look at the bear as a teacher for it's power of endurance. <br>
After many winters druids often begin to emulate the sleep patterns of<br>
the bear, and are able to learn the bears gift of hardiness.<br>
