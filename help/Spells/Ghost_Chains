Often the opening attack of a sorcerer, the spell summons grasping<br>
ghostly chains that can entangle even ethereal creatures, binding them to<br>
the ground.  Once captured, the sorcerer can then unleash their disease<br>
and poison attacks with little fear of reprisal.  Even when the bonds<br>
break, a targets movement remains somewhat restricted for a period of<br>
time beyond the initial imprisonment.  The spell works best on<br>
human-sized creatures, the chains often too weak to bind those of the<br>
giant races.<br>
