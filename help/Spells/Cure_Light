Cure light is the first of all the healing spells.  It will heal minor<br>
wounds and save dying players but in most cases will not heal massive<br>
amounts of damage.  It is taught to young clerics and paladins so that<br>
they may heal small wounds on themselves or on their companions. <br>
Learning this spell is essential, though, to learning the spells which<br>
heal more damage.<br>
