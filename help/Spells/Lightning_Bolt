A very potent, damaging spell useable by only the more experienced of<br>
magi.  This spell builds upon a mage's knowledge of the electrical forces<br>
gained through use of the shock spell.  While lightning tends to be<br>
a bit unpredictable, this potent spell is raw and known for its capacity<br>
to inflicting incredible harm.<br>
