This ranger spell enables the caster to call upon their special link with<br>
the out-of-doors and further protect themselves from damage when fighting<br>
monsters from the world of plants.  Although limited in the types of<br>
monsters it works against, this spell is very effective against leafy<br>
foes.<br>
