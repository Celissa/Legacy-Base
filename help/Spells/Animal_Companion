Druids spend so much time in the wilderness that often they get lonely<br>
speaking only to trees and the occasional traveller.  The animal<br>
companion spell alleviates this problem a little, it calls forth a<br>
creature that becomes bonded to the druid.  This bond is so close that<br>
the druid is able to walk the land in the guise of their companion.<br>
