Through the ages, a mage has found his or her familiar to be more than<br>
just a useful companion.  Often a mage's familiar has become an extension<br>
of the mage.  Yet, limited by their small size, most were viewed as<br>
nothing more than trained pets.  Such is no longer the case.  An<br>
archmage, by tapping into planer magics, has been able to come up with a<br>
spell designed to summon powerful allies that are more than just mere<br>
familiars.  In order for this spell to be successful, it must be cast on<br>
an item likely to have some special meaning or semblance to the desired<br>
ally being requested.<br>
<br>
These allies are said to aid only those of similar alignments.  Rumors<br>
speak of the following allies having previously been summoned: <br>
