Tame is a ranger spell allowing the caster to tame a wild animal.  A tame<br>
animal will become the pet of the caster.  The profiency of the caster<br>
will determine how readilly a animal will accept being tamed.  Generally<br>
the skill only works on woodland type animals, and some creatures are<br>
just too strong willed to be tamed.  A frog, skeleton or insect is<br>
impossible to tame, but a rabbit or bear or other animal is possible.<br>
You can only tame a number of animals whose total levels are less than or<br>
equal to your level of experience.<br>
<br>
Remember, implicit in the tame spell is the idea that the ranger is, in a<br>
sense, befriending the creature.  Rangers cannot, nor would they, gain<br>
the trust of a creature only to betray it, sell it, or otherwise abuse<br>
the spirit of such a creature.<br>
<br>
Remeber, also, that not all pets are welcome in all towns.  Some citizens<br>
of certain towns loathe certain animals and will attack them on sight.<br>
