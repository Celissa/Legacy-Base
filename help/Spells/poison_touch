A druid learns early which creatures and plants to avoid due to their<br>
poisoned nature.  Many druids however study such poisons, both because<br>
they can be benevolent but also because it is merely another aspect of<br>
nature.  With this the druid may channel poison through their body<br>
against a foe.<br>
