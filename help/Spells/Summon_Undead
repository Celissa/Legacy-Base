Summons forth a powerful undead minion to serve its master.  Unlike the<br>
summon skeleton spells, this calls forth the first demonic undead, a<br>
great winged bat-like creature.  Wreathed in unholy energy, the bat can<br>
inflicted both magical and mundane damage on its victims.  Calling forth<br>
such a creature is not without some sacrifice.  A sorcerer must be<br>
willing to shed both his own and others' blood to complete the evocation. <br>
Because of the dangers of controlling such a creature a sorcerer cannot<br>
summon undead and skeletons at the same time.<br>
