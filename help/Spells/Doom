The sorcerer focuses the power of misfortune and misery to inflict a<br>
terrible doom upon a victim.  Under the weight of a doom spell, the<br>
unfortunate target, has their martial skills and defenses eroded.  When<br>
doom is upon a target, a sorcerer often finds other mind effecting spells<br>
increase the suffering to a most delightful level.  As with most<br>
nightmare spells, this spell has no effect on mindless foe.<br>
