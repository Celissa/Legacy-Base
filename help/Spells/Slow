This spell drapes a heavy blanket on the victims mind.  The affect is said<br>
to feel like your limbs are moving through water, and that everything you<br>
do seems in slow motion.  Creatures strong of will have been known to throw<br>
off the effects of this spell.  The snail shell is used as a focus point<br>
more than anything else, but needed nonetheless.<br>
