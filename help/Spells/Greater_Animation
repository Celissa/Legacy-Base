Calling upon the casters greater understanding of life and death and the<br>
means by which corpses can be reanimated, this spell can be used to<br>
reanimate a corpse with even greater power.  The corpses flesh will rot<br>
away leaving behind a grisly skeleton that will be harder to hit and more<br>
dangerous than its zombie counterpart.  Like its lesser zombie form, it<br>
is slave to the caster's will, remains under the casters control only so<br>
long as his or her power infuses it, and it is unable to heal from its<br>
wounds.  This is an evil spell, favored generally by those to whom<br>
involvement with the dead is no great moral quandary.<br>
  <br>
All undead created in this fashion are chaotic evil.  Infer what you will.<br>
