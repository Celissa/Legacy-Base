Using shadow magic, the sorcerer cloaks himself in a veil of death, the<br>
undead (for the most part) will not bother an individual affected by this. <br>
While it remains in effect, a sorcerer can pass undetected by any undead. <br>
Aggressive actions or spells destroy the cloak instantly, and once<br>
detected by the undead, a sorcerer cannot recloak themselves.<br>
