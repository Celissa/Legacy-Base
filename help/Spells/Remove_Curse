This spell will destroy cursed (non-removable) objects on the target's<br>
person.  Those who are but initiates in the spell find a single curse<br>
almost more than they can handle while the well-practiced can easily<br>
handle two curses at once.  Only those who have truly mastered the spell<br>
can bring the focus of their deity's power upon more than two curses at<br>
once.<br>
