This is the most basic of the mage's spells designed to help them find a<br>
familiar suited to their disposition.  It can only be cast once per<br>
level, and a mage, of course, can have only one familiar at a time.  The<br>
success of all of these spells requires that the mage have a reagent<br>
designed to attract a specific type of animal.<br>
 <br>
A mage can use their familiar as an aide in battle, but it is more<br>
important in its use as a scout and confidant.  A mage may switch to<br>
take over the body of their familiar and return to return to their<br>
own body.  Exactly what each familiar can do is based upon the specific<br>
animal.<br>
