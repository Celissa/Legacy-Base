Summons a blazing fiend of blood and fire to serve the sorcerer.  The<br>
powerful creature is the strongest that can walk upon the earth in<br>
servitude.  Called from the demonic planes, the fiend attacks its foes<br>
from a distance, preferring fire and arcane means to dispatch an enemy. <br>
Under its haze of smoldering flame and pitch smoke, the creature twists<br>
and shifts in pure chaotic form.  Calling such a powerful ally requires<br>
more in the way of blood sacrifices from both the sorcerer and an<br>
unwilling victim.<br>
