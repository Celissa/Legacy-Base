When a mage casts this, the culmination of their fire spells, a raging<br>
inferno errupts and consumes those unfortunate enough to be the target. <br>
The speed and ferocity of this spell is unsurpassed.  Its very power<br>
drains the mage significantly, often requiring rest after casting this<br>
spell.<br>
