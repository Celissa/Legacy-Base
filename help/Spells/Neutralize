Neutralize is the spell to cure hallucinations.  Hallucinating will make<br>
you unable to rely upon your senses.  Monsters, players, etc.  will<br>
appear strange, and hallucinating players will find it difficult to do<br>
much anything unless cured.  This spell is also very useful in aiding<br>
players who have been unnaturally silenced.<br>
