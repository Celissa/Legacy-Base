The dead often have many useful components lying about them, and none are<br>
so useful as their eyes.  Using their necromatic magic, a sorcerer can<br>
embue an eye to act as a light source for them.  The sickly light cast<br>
from the dead eye is tinted blood red from the evil enchantment.  As the<br>
spell slowly consumes the soul of the eye's previous owner, the light<br>
lasts almost indefinitely.<br>
