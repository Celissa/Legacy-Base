This is one of the final songs a bladedancer learns.  After years of<br>
learning to protect people from the elements through song bladedancers<br>
learn to put it all together into one song.  When singing this song the<br>
bladedancer calls forth winds from all four directions, winter from the<br>
north, spring from the east, summer from the south, and autumn from the<br>
west.  These four winds mingle around the group protecting them some from<br>
the affects of cold, electricity, fire, and acid.<br>
