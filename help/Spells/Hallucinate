Quite the nasty spell to use on your enemies.  The victim of such spell<br>
sees things with an aura of life different from one moment to the next. <br>
One second he'll think you're an elf, and the next he'll be thinking<br>
you're a treant, and the like.  Things get very confusing very fast.  <br>
