This spell is used to enchant a weapon increasing the damage it does and<br>
improving its chance of striking a target, or armor, increasing its<br>
protective qualities.  The effect is permament.  There is a small chance<br>
with this spell that something will go wrong and the object will be<br>
destroyed in the process.<br>
