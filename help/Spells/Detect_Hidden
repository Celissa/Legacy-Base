There are magics to defeat other people using magic to hide themselves<br>
but, sometimes an opponent is using just good old fashioned-skill.  This<br>
can be troublesome, and so this spell was developed.  It allows the user<br>
to 'see' vibrations of anything moving near you.  You can't tell exactly<br>
what it is sometimes, but you will at least see that it is there.  <br>
