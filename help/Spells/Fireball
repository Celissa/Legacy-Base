A potent spell which harnesses the unpredictable energies of magical fire. <br>
Some flint is used as a trigger for the spell.  The spell creates a<br>
very small sphere of oscillating yellow-white which drifts almost lazily<br>
from the caster's fingertip.  At a completing word of power, the sphere<br>
explodes.  Some of the more powerful magi have been known to channel<br>
enough energy through the gate, that things are actually blown out of the<br>
room.<br>
