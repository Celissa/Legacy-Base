The most effective spell of the sorcerer's wrench spells, the soul tear<br>
attacks the life essence of a target, bypassing armor and defenses to<br>
inflicte horrendous pain and suffering on them.  Although it is not the<br>
most damaging spell, most sorcerers delight in the amount of agony it<br>
produces.<br>
