First, the sorcerer wraps him/her self in the flesh of the dead.  Second,<br>
they transform their flesh into that of the dead.  The last step before<br>
becoming a memeber of the undead is to imitate the spirits.  Sorcerers<br>
are now capable of transforming theirself into that of a wraith.  They<br>
are not true undead yet, but they are now another step closer.<br>
