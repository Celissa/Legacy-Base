This spell torments the target with nightmarish images that overwhelm<br>
them with horror and fear so real that they begin to die from the<br>
onslaught.  Although a low end nightmare spell, it can be very effective<br>
on the weak of will and simple creatures.  Undead and those without fear<br>
or sentient thought are unaffected by this spell.<br>
