With this dark incantation the sorcerer links his spirit to his infernal<br>
pet, enabling them to transfer damage from themselves when struck in<br>
combat.  Each hit upon the sorcerer may be siphoned to their simulacrum,<br>
damaging it instead.  It is possible to kill your pet in this way and<br>
suffer the backlash of both the dark magic and the fury of the dark gods.<br>
