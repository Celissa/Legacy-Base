Calls down demonic fire into an area, cleansing life from those foolish<br>
enough to risk the wrath of a sorcerer.  This spell effects all<br>
non-players in the room causing reasonable damage and much pain to its<br>
victims.  As the magic is unholy fire, the spell can effect those who are<br>
normally resistant to flame.<br>
