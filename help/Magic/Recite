<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
recite [scroll_name] [target] <br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Some spells are written down on scrolls, and to access those spells,<br>
one must recite the scroll.  Not all scrolls have targets; reciting a<br>
scroll of magic mapping does not requre a target.<br>
<br>
Note : recall scrolls have an additional, optional argument which can be<br>
used -<br>
<br>
recite recall [town_name] [player]<br>
<br>
The effect is having the player recalled to the specific town; no town<br>
name is required, though, and in that case, the default town will be the<br>
town of that player's race.<br>
