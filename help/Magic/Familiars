Familiars are magical pets which are available only to mages.  Through<br>
the use of the spell Find Familiar, a wizard magically bonds himself<br>
with a creature in a symbiotic relationship.  A mage may only have one<br>
familiar per level.<br>
<br>
While generally not very strong fighters, familiars offer other<br>
advantages to their masters.  Through the use of the switch command,<br>
a mage may 'see' Through the eyes of his or her familiar.  [In playing<br>
terms, you can operate the familiar, moving about and such as if you<br>
actually were the familiar.] This can make familiars excellent scouts, or<br>
guards for a wounded mage, and some familiars have special abilities or<br>
resistances.  See also the Pet command on naming your familiar, and<br>
Option Pet Assist for information on whether or not you wish your<br>
familiar to assist you in battle.<br>
