<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
These two categories of spells, conjuration and summoning, usually depend<br>
upon casting a given spell over a particular reagent.  Lesser Summoning,<br>
Find Familiar, Request Ally, Find Mount, Conjure Elemental, and Construct<br>
Golem are such spells.  The degree to which you know the spell has a<br>
direct determination on its rate of success.  Some reagents are more rare<br>
than other, so pay heed and study the spell to your fullest capability<br>
before casting one of these spells on an extremely rare reagent.<br>
