<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Switch is the command used by mages to operate their familiars.  While in<br>
their familiars bodies, mages will 'see' things from the familiar's<br>
viewpoint, and will or will not have infravision, detect hidden, etc.,<br>
according to the familiar's senses.  To return from a familiar to one's<br>
body, the command is, logically enough, return.<br>
