Magic in this realm is different from what you might be used to.  Reagents<br>
are required for most all spells in addition to the appropriate gestures.<br>
To see what spells you can learn at your level, type "abil s".  If you are<br>
a spell-caster you should have at least one spell.  The word next to the<br>
spell describes your profiency at casting that spell.  This will increase<br>
the more you cast the spell.<br>
<br>
To find out more about a particular spell, type spell spell name.  This<br>
will give you the lowdown on the spell, listing its reagents, description,<br>
casting time, etc.  To find reagents for a spell, look around in the wild<br>
or visit various shops scattered across the realms.  Some are commonplace<br>
and widely available, and some are quite expensive and/or difficult to<br>
find.<br>
<br>
To cast a spell, type "cast [spell name] [target]". This requires<br>
that you have the proper reagents in your inventory, know the spell at at<br>
least level 1, and have enough energy to cast it.  Energy is listed<br>
under the prompt next to the 'e'.  It slowly regenerates up to some max<br>
that increases with level and intelligence.  To see your current max,<br>
type "score".  When you successful cast a spell you will begin to perform<br>
the necessary gestures.  This can take from 1-5 turns.<br>
<br>
For mages (and eventually other delvers in the mystical arts), the amount<br>
of metal worn on one's body affects the casting cost of spells in terms<br>
of energy.  This is due to how metal interferes with the magical fields<br>
and forces necessary for the proper casting of spells.  If your spells<br>
suddenly jump in their casting costs, check your inventory; you're<br>
most likely wearing something metal that is to blame.<br>
<br>
When spell casters are bashed (in addition to some other commands) by<br>
mobs or other players, a spell might be disrupted.  Beware.<br>
<br>
Some spells are leech spells, and will remain active until you stop<br>
feeding them energy off of your max.  Type leech and help leech<br>
to find out more about this.<br>
<br>
To find out the specific spells available to a class, type help<br>
Abilities.  Additional help files that may be useful include<br>
spell, and leech.<br>
