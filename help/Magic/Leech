<h1> Description </h1>
  <br>
Some spells have no set duration but will continue until the spellcaster<br>
stops them by cutting off the power going to the spell.  LEECH is the<br>
command that allows him to do this.  Typing leech alone will bring up a<br>
list of all the spells that the spellcaster has running.  The 'Max Mana:<br>
xxx (yyy max)' is your maximum amount of mana the xxx part is the maximum<br>
available and the yyy part is your total amount of mana.  the 'Regen. <br>
Rate: xx (yy) is how fast you will regain your energy once again the xx<br>
is your current regen and the yy is your total.  The 'Num' column is the<br>
spell number, this is the number that you would use to stop the spell<br>
from drawing energy from you.  The 'Spell' column is the name of the<br>
spell.  The 'Regen' column shows the amount that the spell is draining<br>
from your Regen.  Rate.  The 'Max' column is the amount of mana a spell<br>
drains from your max mana.  And the 'Character' column shows who the<br>
spell is cast on.<br>
