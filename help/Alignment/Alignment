The following is a listing of the nine alignments.  Definitions and<br>
examples are contained therein.<br>
<br>
Lawful Good - Characters of this alignment believe that when people<br>
respect society's laws and try to help one another, society as a whole<br>
prospers.  Player's of this alignment believe that by following the Law, <br>
they will do the most Good, and will follow rules and laws even if <br>
they may personally feel that a particular law or rule is wrong. <br>
(An extreme example of this conflict might be a samurai, who follows <br>
his Lord's command, EVEN if he thinks its wrong, then commits <br>
seppuku afterwards to display his personal protest.) Lawful good <br>
players would most likely gravitate to clans of like mind, believing <br>
them to be first and best (perhaps only) way to do the most good.<br>
<br>
Lawful Neutral - As long as there are laws and rules, this character <br>
will follow them with no hesitation.  The people that the Law has put <br>
in charge of the character know better than the character what is right <br>
or wrong. The player 'knows' this, because the Law put those people in <br>
charge, and the Law is always right. Therefore, such a player will <br>
follow all orders without question, and believe themselves to be doing <br>
the right thing, because following the rules will eventually make <br>
everything work out.<br>
<br>
Lawful Evil - This character believes in using laws and rules for his<br>
own gain.  Even if the character is on the bottom rung of the ladder,<br>
they will follow the rules, and learn to use the rules to benefit<br>
themselves and 'get ahead'.  A lawful evil being would be an iron-fisted<br>
tyrant (like Hitler), part of the tyrants regime (a Nazi) or a devious<br>
individual who uses the rules to get what they want (perhaps a lawyer<br>
working for the mob, or someone willfully using laws to protect their own<br>
unethical behavior.) Lawful evil character's would join a clan whose<br>
rigid structure could be used to benefit themselves, or whose iron<br>
control of resources would make him or her powerful by association.<br>
<br>
Neutral Good - This character sees the need for good.  He or she uses<br>
laws and rules when they will do good, and ignores them when they seem to<br>
be causing harm.  They do what they think is right at the time.  A lord<br>
who violates orders from his king to destroy something he sees as evil<br>
would be considered neutral good.  A player of this alignment might join<br>
a good clan if it seems that clan might allow them to accomplish the most<br>
good (or might _not_ join a clan for the same reason), but unlike a<br>
lawful good character, the NG character might still go against certain<br>
decisions of the clan (covertly or overtly), if they thought the decision<br>
or rule was wrong.<br>
<br>
True Neutral - True neutral characters dont much care for good or<br>
evil, prefering to stay on the sidelines.  As long as the law doesnt<br>
intrude upon their goals, they abide by it -- when it doesn't, they<br>
ignore it.  A mercenary who fights only for the coin, caring nothing for<br>
either side, would be truly neutral.  They might join a clan if they<br>
stood a good chance of gain without becoming entangled in 'causes'.<br>
<br>
Neutral Evil - The only interest of this character is getting ahead.<br>
Whether its by means that are legal or questionable, they take advantage<br>
of it.  They don't have the every-man-for-himself quality of a chaotic<br>
evil, but they have been known to betray friends to the authorities for<br>
personal gain.  They might join a clan if that would benefit them the<br>
most, but would leave if the benefits they perceived faded or did not<br>
develop as planned.<br>
<br>
Chaotic Good - Strongly independent, these individuals have no use<br>
for any law or rule.  Their own moral code guides their actions and doing<br>
good is a personal thing.  Any means justifies the end result if that<br>
result is goodness.  A vigilante is an example of chaotic good.  Chaotic<br>
good characters usually think that rules and laws hurt more than they<br>
help...  they may agree with everything the laws stand for, but they<br>
think setting down laws is the first step toward ruining the cause.  Laws<br>
are part of the problem, not the solution, and as such, this character<br>
would rarely join an order or organization, though they might if the the<br>
clan represented a very loose alliance or shared philosophy.  A group of<br>
characters who acted independantly of each other most of the time and<br>
follow their own individual sets of morals, but who do work towards a<br>
common goal and share information and support when possible, without a<br>
strict set of rules might be a good example of a clan a chaotic good<br>
player would join, as would a clan dedicated simply to 'acquiring and<br>
protecting knowledge'.<br>
<br>
Chaotic Neutral - These people tend to follow whatever whim strikes<br>
them at the moment.  There is no order or reason to their actions, as<br>
laws and rules mean nothing to them -- many change their mind on a whim.<br>
Good and evil do not affect their decisions.  If they cant decide on <br>
a course of action, they might flip a coin -- heads, give the child a <br>
toy; tails, burn the child's house down for sport. Chaotic neutrals <br>
almost never join a clan, as they don't commit to any cause for more <br>
than a few days before becoming bored.<br>
<br>
Chaotic Evil - Chaotic evil characters see nothing wrong with taking<br>
whatever they want how ever they can.  Laws and rules are for the weak. <br>
The strong have the right to take what they want.  Bloodthirsty bandits<br>
or a rampaging monster would be chaotic evil. Chaotic evils might form<br>
temporary groups (perhaps to destroy and loot a small town), but would <br>
never join a long term clan.<br>
