Good:<br>
Creatures of a good alignment work to maximize the good of society<br>
as a whole, benevolently putting the interests of others above, or equal<br>
to, their own.<br>
<br>
Neutral:<br>
Those of a neutral alignment are not overly concerned with the<br>
interests of others, preferring to work toward their own goals.  However,<br>
harming others in the process is not acceptable to them.<br>
<br>
Evil:<br>
Concerned solely with themselves, evil beings will do whatever is<br>
necessary to acheive their goals, regardless of the harm done to those who<br>
get in their way.<br>
<br>
<br>
The following categories are personal beliefs.  They reflect how you<br>
live your life within your alignment and society.  There is no right or<br>
wrong, only the way your character feels is the best way to acheive the<br>
goals they desire.<br>
<br>
Lawful:<br>
Lawful characters follow the laws of their society and try to uphold<br>
them.  Order and organization are his two favorite things.<br>
<br>
Neutral:<br>
A neutral person will abide by the laws of his society but he makes<br>
no effort to uphold or encourage them.<br>
<br>
Chaotic:<br>
Chaotic people care nothing for the laws and happily flaunt them<br>
every chance they get.<br>
<br>
Note:  A lawful evil character is one who cheerfully backstabs his<br>
fellows if this seems an advantageous action but who believes the best<br>
method of gaining personal happiness is through being in an organization<br>
with his fellows.  He respects the increase in plunder and pillage from<br>
being with other plunderers and pillagers.<br>
