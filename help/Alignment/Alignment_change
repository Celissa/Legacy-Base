So, you want an alignment change.  Well..... NO!!!<br>
<br>
All kidding aside, the truth of the matter is you probably aren't going<br>
to get one.  I'll lay down the basics for you so you'll understand where<br>
matters lie.<br>
<br>
Rule #1: NO ONE gets to change alignment between Good - Neutral - Evil.<br>
This may have happened in the past, but it is unequivocally not going to<br>
happen now.  Policy stands.<br>
That means no good to neutral, no neutral to good.  No neutral to evil,<br>
and no evil to neutral, and absolutely no good to evil or vice-versa.<br>
Let me clarify good, neutral and evil.  They are the 3 base alignments.<br>
<br>
Good = lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good.<br>
Neutral = lawful neutral, pure neutral, chaotic neutral.<br>
Evil = lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil.<br>
<br>
In other words... Neutral Good means you are of "good" alignment, NOT "neutral".<br>
In any alignment where neutral is the first word, it means neutrality of<br>
law and chaos, not neutrality of good and evil alignment.<br>
<br>
Ok, hopefully we have that little bit of confusion straightened out.  The<br>
last part seems to confuse so many people, and a thorough understanding<br>
of it can save both your and our lives a great deal of mental sparring<br>
over a pointless debate.<br>
<br>
Rule #2: You can not change from lawful to chaotic or chaotic to lawful.<br>
Pretty straightforward I think.<br>
<br>
Rule #3: Even if you manage the nearly impossible feat of earning an<br>
alignment change once, it will NOT happen again.  For example, if you<br>
start as chaotic good, the best you can ever hope for is neutral good. <br>
In truth, you probably won't even get that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Its not that we don't think people can change, we even used to do them<br>
occassionally, but the problem is almost all the time it is for reasons<br>
that are not realistic (realistic being used with some artisic license,<br>
as it means real within the little fantasy realm we have created here). <br>
In the end, it wasn't worth altering 100 people because 1 person in the<br>
group had a good reason and bothered to follow role playing restrictions<br>
anyhow.  Most people who want one haven't bothered role playing their<br>
alignment in the first place.  The only reason they're asking is to join<br>
a clan or use equipment they can't currently.<br>
<br>
So, how can you get one of these rare alterations of your personna?<br>
My suggestions are as follows...<br>
<br>
First, ask an imm if they'll even consider doing it.<br>
(After all the hassle, and policy stating we wont we still have the same<br>
100 people trying to argue to change because "they're reason should be<br>
allowed, even though they understand why no one else's should.") <br>
If they say no, don't argue about it.  This is about the only time asking<br>
another imm might work.  Asking an imm after one has told you no we won't<br>
allow you only gets you in trouble because we post such things.  If they<br>
said no because they are tired of the whining (and most of it is whining)<br>
then they'll probably just say no and hope you leave them alone.  Arguing<br>
will only make them mad and work against you.<br>
<br>
Second, be prepared to make a commitment.<br>
I tell them to role play their current alignment for about a month.<br>
post notes showing that they are playing that alignment, at least 1<br>
well-written, well-role-played note on stories a week.<br>
Then, over the next month role play the gradual change of character and<br>
post notes on how that's going too.  At the end, if you've impressed me<br>
suitably that you are, in fact, role playing and have some concept about<br>
what the alignment you are and are changing to entails, I'll probably<br>
change you.<br>
<br>
A little side-note about the posted notes.  A well-written note may be<br>
short, but more often then not you aren't going to be able to write out<br>
all you need to place (atmosphere, setting, drama, what have you) in a<br>
single paragraph.  Such a note should be posted on stories board, as this<br>
is the story of your character's current life.<br>
<br>
(The only exception to these rules may be characters under level 3 who<br>
are just learning mudding and role playing for the first time.  After<br>
that, all rules stand.  If it really means that much to your character,<br>
its more often a better show of devotion to just delete and start over as<br>
a sign of your true change of heart as well as comitment to the change. <br>
Otherwise, it probably wasn't that important to you.  The last stands for<br>
a level 80 as much as it does for a level 10 character.) <br>
