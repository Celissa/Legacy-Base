When choosing a name, make it unique and original when possible. Your<br>
name should reflect the time setting of our world, which is most closely<br>
related to that of the medieval time period. Try not to copy names or<br>
use names that will be outside the following guidelines:<br>
<br>
Names ALLOWED:<br>
 * Completely made-up name or other not-easily recognized name.<br>
   Names should be MEDIEVAL or FANTASY sounding and mostly pronounceable,<br>
   such as Handaran, Aelrynne, and Kuhrt.<br>
 * Common proper names, such as David, are generally permitted.<br>
   However, try to conform your name to your racial type. So<br>
   Lisa and Robert would be all right for humans, but not orcs.<br>
   If your name is very unlike your race as defined by help [race],<br>
   then it won't be allowed<br>
<br>
Names NOT ALLOWED:<br>
 * Almost all words in the English dictionary except proper names.<br>
   Adjectives, adverbs and generally descriptive words are not names.<br>
   Avoid names based on verbs, such as Slasher, Mauler, Killer.<br>
 * Names associated with well-known historical or fictional figures<br>
   that is not also merely a common name, such as Cleopatra or Gandalf.<br>
 * Names associated almost exclusively with a major religious figure.<br>
 * Names of large cities around the world that aren't also common names.<br>
 * Names that are anachronistic (anything not approximately medieval,<br>
   such as Rocketman).<br>
 * Names must not include a title, such as Sir, Queen.<br>
 * Foreign words that are offensive or is otherwise not permitted<br>
   as above.<br>
 * Nicknames or Names that depend upon the person you are now or some<br>
   physical attribute, such as Lightfingers, Stubbytoes, or One-eye.<br>
 * Bastardizations that are offensive-sounding or an obvious<br>
   version of words not belonging to this world.<br>
 * If an immortal says your name violates one of the above rules, it does.<br>
<br>
As long as the name is not offensive, Immortals and Avatars should<br>
politely ask for a name change. If the person refuses, please unapprove<br>
the person and talk to an Immortal. Imprisoning the person, freezing<br>
them, or disconnecting them is not appropriate unless the person is<br>
uncooperative.<br>
<br>
If the name is offensive, you may either ask them to change the name or<br>
disconnect them immediately.  This decision should be based on the degree<br>
of offensiveness and how reasonable the person is.  Some people do logon<br>
for the sole purpose of causing trouble.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, if an immortal asks you to do something (such as change<br>
your name) it is assumed they have a good reason and you should comply.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Just because you were approved does not mean your name is<br>
automatically a good name. If you know it is a bad name, sooner or later,<br>
you will be asked to change it.<br>
