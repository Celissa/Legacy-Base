This mud uses name completion.  Player names which contain, or are<br>
substrings of extant names are not permitted.  This avoids confusion<br>
among players.  The name Malice, for example, would be forbidden if the<br>
name Mali already existed, and vice-versa.  The name you chose conflicted<br>
with an already existing name.  Please choose another.<br>
