Changing a single letter to make a minor difference is essentially the<br>
same as using the donor name.  Klown will essentially be treated the same<br>
as Clown.  It is a pretty blatant and poor attempt.<br>
  <br>
It is not impossible to come up with a decent and original name.<br>
However, if you are going to steal a name from a book:<br>
1) Don't steal obvious names like Bilbo or Gandalf<br>
   steal more obscure people, tertiary characters,  support characters.<br>
2) If there's a good chance others will know you, don't contradict<br>
   yourself by making Baba Yaga the orc thief, or Ali Baba<br>
   the human paladin.  If you steal a name, you take with it<br>
   certain concepts and atmosphere.  Don't offer up the concept<br>
NOTE: You risk the chance that the immortals will decide that your<br>
name is too well-known.<br>
