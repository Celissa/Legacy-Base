Third, we have a policy which states that the immortals of this mud shall<br>
not interfere in player disputes. Should you and a fellow player find<br>
yourselves at odds, then find an appropriate means to deal with it. Ask<br>
a passerby to moderate your discussion, ignore each other, have it out in<br>
battle, start a war between your clans, etc. Perhaps you may even wish to<br>
pray to your chosen deity for guidance.<br>
<br>
Fourth, much adventure lies in the completion of campaigns. You will be<br>
required to complete numerous campaigns throughout your lifespan here. It<br>
is our policy that players not share information regarding campaigns with<br>
other players. We actively enforce this by modifying campaigns on a per-<br>
character basis, so that no two campaigns are ever exactly the same.<br>
<br>
Additionally, we are working on an extensive faction system, whereby<br>
players are brought into the game belonging to no faction, and may be<br>
recruited into a faction once playing.  The factions will have a loosely<br>
defined power structure which will will be as volatile as the members of<br>
the faction.  It is not uncommon for a faction leader to be unseated by a<br>
an underling, nor is it unheard of to find that two factions have merged<br>
to become more powerful.  Factions are both tools of strategic importance<br>
and means of safety for their members.  Take great care in your<br>
decisions.  <br>
