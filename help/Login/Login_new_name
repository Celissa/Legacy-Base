Welcome, new adventurer!  Legacy's Dawning has a highly developed,<br>
unique fantasy role-playing environment.  Please choose a name<br>
appropriate to such a setting.  Original names are best.  Characters<br>
with anachronistic, well known rip-off names (like Gandalf or Bilbo), or<br>
otherwise inappropriate names will be asked by an immortal to think of a<br>
more apt name.  Obscene or offensive names will cause the imms to hunt<br>
you down, rip out your heart, and feed it to our pet lag beast.  Oh, you<br>
will also get banned.<br>
