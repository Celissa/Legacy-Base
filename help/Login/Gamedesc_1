This game is a role-playing adventure.  In it, you will experience many<br>
joys, adventures, perils, and quite possibly face death.  We have worked<br>
hard to convey to you our image of this world, and ask that in your<br>
decision to join it you take a few things into consideration.  <br>
<br>
First, in this world, it behooves you to chose a character style and <br>
follow it throughout your lifespan - people do not recognize you by name,<br>
and must therefore become familiar with your style of speech and manner of<br>
of actions. The setting of this game is a parallel universe to ours in a<br>
time equivalent to our Dark Ages.<br>
<br>
Second, we emphasize realism in this game.  This means that times are<br>
quite tough for all players.  There are thieves and murderers, corrupt<br>
guards and officials, and demonic cults.  By the same token, however,<br>
there are an equal number of valiant knights and their vassals, holy<br>
clerics, and wise mages.  Beware to treat all in such a manner that you<br>
wish to be treated, and do not be gracious with trust - trust should be<br>
earned, not given.  <br>
