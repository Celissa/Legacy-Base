You determine your own stats given a set number of "points." Stats can<br>
range from 3 to 21 with higher being better.  To raise a stat type +C<br>
where C is the first letter of the stat name.  Similarly to lower a stat<br>
type -C.  You may also raise or lower it more than one step by typing<br>
"-2C or +2C." When you are done (you are advised to have close to zero<br>
points left) type "done" to continue.  <br>
