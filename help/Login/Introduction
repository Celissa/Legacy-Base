You are about to find yourself in the world of Legacy's Dawning.  If you<br>
have chosen a 'light' race (human, elf, dwarf, halfling, gnome, or ent)<br>
or lizardmen, you will begin in Chiiron; other races will begin in<br>
Voaleth.  Sorcerers begin on the new continent in the town of Tar'ippal. <br>
All three cities have trainers to help you learn your basic skills, and<br>
shops to provide you with essentials.<br>
<br>
There are many help files available to you, including help starting and<br>
help newbie.  Please read these and other files thoroughly before asking<br>
others for help.<br>
 <br>
While you are reading, begin to think about your character and their<br>
history; you will need to have an appearance, keywords, and description<br>
approved by an Avatar before you can progress past level 5.<br>
 <br>
Now, press return, and see what wonders there are awaiting you.<br>
