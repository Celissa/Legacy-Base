                     -- Welcome to Legacy's Dawning! --<br>
<br>
To play here, all players are required to create an account via email<br>
registration.  This is done in order to keep track of our growing player<br>
base.  The belief is that it will encourage a friendly atmosphere<br>
conducive toward our common goal - fun.<br>
<br>
Please choose a name for your account.  Virtually anything will do, so<br>
long as it is between 5 and 20 characters in length and contains no<br>
spaces.  We recommend using a last name.  Despite this intimidating<br>
introduction, the mud is free to all and new players are more than<br>
welcome to join the game.<br>
