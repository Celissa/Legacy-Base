Average Statistics for Goblins<br>
<br>
Height: males and females about 3'6" - 4'4"<br>
<br>
Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.<br>
      When they do have hair it is usually black or brown and is<br>
      usually caked in muck and filth.  Goblins have no facial hair.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are usually<br>
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of<br>
      dark brown, reddish brown, or a muddy-amber color.  The iris <br>
      extends to the edge of the eye with a pupil that dilates between<br>
      a pinprick in size to large circle as lighting permits.<br>
<br>
Affiliation: goblins are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic<br>
neutral alignments only.<br>
<br>
Appearance: goblins have wrinkled, craggy skin or smooth, greasy skin in<br>
colors of greens and browns or patchy/mottled earth tone mixes.  Though<br>
they have fewer warts and protuberances than orcs, ogres and trolls, they<br>
are not completely free of them as a race.  Goblins tend to have sharp<br>
teeth, though they are small and would not be called fangs by any<br>
stretch of the imagination.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing a Goblin<br>
<br>
Goblins are a tough and wily breed known for their extreme tolerance of<br>
situations that would drive out most other races.  Their resistance to<br>
disease and infection as well as their tendency to reproduce in great<br>
numbers make them about as impossible to be rid of as cockroaches.  Most<br>
often the truth of the matter is that the larger races goblins hang<br>
around are better at digging out tunnels and caves and cast off more than<br>
ample resources to provide goblins with all they need to survive. <br>
Unfortunately for the larger races this means that the goblins also have<br>
free time to explore and be a general nuisance.<br>
<br>
Goblins really could care less about wasting time on hygiene and actually<br>
enjoy the feel of cool, slimy muck squishing between toes, fingers and<br>
any other joint.  Their greatest joys in life are exploring everywhere,<br>
everything, and gathering as many things as they can.  To most other<br>
races this comes across as intrusion and theft, however, the goblins seem<br>
to be one of the few peoples who truly understand and are happy with the<br>
rule stating that possession is 9/10ths of the law.<br>
Though goblins have pervaded everywhere there are generally only two<br>
varieties to be found.  The more common is the typical small, smelly<br>
green goblin.  The rarer white goblin is found only in the northern Cairn<br>
mountains and have a tendency to be a bit larger and more organized than<br>
their smaller cousins.  Though more organized, the white goblins seem to<br>
be more like small orcs and tend to make poor spell casters.  Of the two<br>
varieties, green goblins tend to make the better thieves and explorers<br>
while white goblins tend to make better warriors and know how to dig in<br>
and occupy an area.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Goblins are a very communal people and love to chatter away at each<br>
other, though much of the conversation usually consists of "mine, mine,<br>
mine!" <br>
<br>
Trolls and ogres are considered dangerous and insufferable because they<br>
tend to use their superior size and strength to boss around the goblins. <br>
The only thing that makes being near them tolerable is the sheer amount<br>
of useful goods they leave just lying around or cast off.<br>
<br>
Orcs as bad as ogres and trolls, only what they lack in comparative<br>
strength they make up for in organization and intellect.  Fortunately any<br>
goblin can point out just why goblins are still the superior intelligence<br>
of the four races.<br>
<br>
Goblins will avoid dwarves when possible due to a long-standing dwarven<br>
crusade to destroy all goblins.  Unfortunately they are all too good at<br>
that task as goblins have learned.  Dwarves are the goblins most hated of<br>
all races and any jab they can inflict on the race is worth getting in.<br>
<br>
Elves are almost as bad as dwarves, though if it has been amply<br>
demonstrated that if you leave them alone they will usually leave you<br>
alone.<br>
<br>
Vyans are an odd lot and, for those interested in attempting to wheedle<br>
it out of them, are an excellent source one can learn magic from. <br>
Everything an elf could be is brought forth in what the vyans are. <br>
Unfortunately it also comes at the price of more insufferably bullying,<br>
and with their swords and magic the vyans are quick to back up any<br>
threats.  Still, they make excellent allies.<br>
<br>
Gnomes, strangely, are a puzzle to goblins who figure that somehow the<br>
races must be related, with gnomes the lesser relation in need of goblin<br>
help, of course.  Why gnomes can't seem to learn to take orders and<br>
continue to associate with races like dwarves is a source of constant<br>
frustration to the goblins who would desperately like a new ally (or,<br>
better yet, someone they could actually bully around).<br>
<br>
Humans are a source of never-ending amazement, so long as you don't hang<br>
out with the goody-goody ones that just want to kill you.  They build<br>
dwellings almost everywhere, travel more than any other race and return<br>
with so many neat things for goblins to appropriate.  Not to mention they<br>
make the most amusing faces when they are forced to deal with goblins.<br>
<br>
Halflings, as far as goblins are concerned, are just another race of<br>
humans only shorter and more likely to be easier to boss around. <br>
Unfortunately they aren't quite as productive when it comes to<br>
travelling and acquiring new things for goblins to appropriate.<br>
<br>
Ents are a bit of a mystery.  They may look a bit like trolls but they<br>
are neither as blatantly hostile nor as pleasing to the eye.  No slime,<br>
no warts, and their skin almost looks more like bark than the nice<br>
texture common to trolls.  Fortunately they do have the most interesting<br>
responses when you uproot small plants or set larger ones on fire.<br>
