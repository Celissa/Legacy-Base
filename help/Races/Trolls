Average Statistics for Trolls<br>
<br>
Height: males about 6'4" - 7'4"<br>
        females: about 6'6" - 7'6"<br>
<br>
Hair: Swamp trolls tend to have black hair, not always on their<br>
      head.  What hair grows on them is either greasy or coarse.<br>
      Ice trolls of the north have white hair, with at least<br>
      more on their head than elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.<br>
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.<br>
<br>
Affiliation: trolls are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic<br>
neutral alignment.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Trolls have green skin in a variety of hues (though none are<br>
what would be called vibrant, verdant, bright, neon, or electric green). <br>
They are often warty or have cancerous appearing growths, though these do<br>
not seem to affect their health negatively in any way, rather it appears<br>
to be an excess product of their ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost<br>
never have any scars, as they heal so incredibly well.  For a race that<br>
is typically foul, corrupt and evil they have incongruous gift of<br>
incredible regeneration but it comes at the cost of a never-ending hunger.<br>
<br>
Ice trolls tend to have duller, paler skin that is typically dry.  Their<br>
hair is coarse and bushy.  Swamp trolls tend to have darker shades of<br>
skin and greasy, sparse hair.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing a Troll<br>
<br>
Trolls are known to be big, slow lumbering behemoths whose sole goal in<br>
life is to feed their never-ending appetite.  Fortunately for them, just<br>
about anything short of stone is considered edible and their metabolisms<br>
are quite happy to oblige in that regard.  While an uprooted shrub or<br>
forgotten bit of clothing makes an adequate snack, the best food is<br>
something you just killed yourself.  While some trolls have finally<br>
managed to figure out that skinning an animal might provide fur you can<br>
sell for even better tasting meat, most still prefer to just eat the<br>
corpse outright.  After all, not much tastes better than a fresh kill<br>
whose blood is still warm.  The fact that you just killed it yourself,<br>
somewhat sating an almost equal appetite for destruction is just spice for<br>
the flavoring.<br>
<br>
Two varieties of troll have developed in the realm, though both races<br>
share a few common characteristics.  Hunger, the ability to heal, and a<br>
complete loathing for sunlight.  All trolls prefer the dark of a nice<br>
cave to the painful light of day.  They also all share a deep-rooted fear<br>
of fire as it has the ability to harm them and is about the only thing<br>
likely to scar a troll.<br>
<br>
Swamp trolls are the more common variety when seen at all, tending<br>
towards solitary life.  They are fairly anti-social, even among their own<br>
kind and like to live under the exposed roots of large swamp trees or<br>
under bridges.  They are quick to anger, quick to kill things, and<br>
insufferably monotonous.  They are poor conversationalists with<br>
communication skills often extending at best to grunts and simple<br>
gestures.<br>
<br>
Ice trolls, also called northern trolls, are found primarily in the upper<br>
Cairn mountains and, infrequently, in the Dragonspire mountains.  Unlike<br>
their swampland cousins, they share a common social structure and tend to<br>
live in small familial groups in the mountain caves.  Though they still<br>
share a fairly low level of communication, they are at least known to<br>
have a limited vocabulary making them seem leaps and bounds ahead of<br>
their swampland cousins.  Ice trolls tend to be more intellectually<br>
advanced, which still isn't saying much, heartier in survival, but<br>
smaller, weaker and less brutal in comparison to their cousins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Trolls are typically a solitary breed, though they rarely fight with<br>
other trolls when they do meet.<br>
<br>
Vyans are considered untrustworthy schemers, though useful allies in dire<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
Goblins are only useful as lackeys and servants.<br>
<br>
Orcs make useful allies and fair-to-middling hunting partners<br>
particularly when the quarry is elves.<br>
<br>
Short of other trolls, ogres make the best companions as they share the<br>
trolls' lack of love for conversation and their love of carnage.<br>
<br>
Elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings are despised as legions of light<br>
and order as much as their tendency to get in the way of a good meal. <br>
Fortunately they, themselves make excellent meals.  Provided they didn't<br>
bring fire, one meal is as good as another.<br>
<br>
The best thing about ents is provoking them.  After all, they look so<br>
much like trolls that they must be related.  Trolls just can't figure out<br>
what's wrong with them that they serve light and goodness.  As they are<br>
typically slow to anger, trolls get great mirth out of trying to convert<br>
ents.  A lack of vocabulary simply means this usually take the form of<br>
offering ents ample bloody meals, which they invariable refuse.  The look<br>
of tormented sadness in their eyes as they consider the harm you caused<br>
to living beings in obtaining the meat is about as much fun to see as it<br>
is getting the meat in the first place.<br>
<br>
The best thing about humans is the fact that they keep building bridges<br>
to hide under and most of them are too weak to harm a troll.  The end<br>
result is that they build trolls fabulous homes then pay them to walk<br>
over them and if they refuse to pay they try to cross anyway making a<br>
never-ending supply of meals that come to your very own front door.  The<br>
occasional human turns to the dark side and makes for an interesting<br>
hunting companion as they can be quite inventive in their destructiveness.<br>
