Average Statistics for Elves<br>
<br>
Height: males about 4'8"-5'8"<br>
        females about 4'6"-5'6"<br>
<br>
Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white/blond) to a darkish brown.<br>
      Very rarely black.  Elves have no facial hair.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily<br>
      brown or blue, though other colors such as amber, lavender<br>
      or other light colors are not wholely uncommon.<br>
<br>
Affiliation: Elves are a light race restricted to good or neutral<br>
alignment.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Elves look much like humans though they generally have a<br>
smaller, slenderer build than humans.  Elves tend to have smooth,<br>
unblemished skin ranging in all normal human skin tones and what humans<br>
would refer to as an ethereal beauty.  Their skin tone is almost always<br>
touched by the healthy glow of sunlight or the silver sheen akin of<br>
moonlight.  Their appearance often gives them an air of regal grace and<br>
their stoic appearance gives them a haughty, uncaring appearance.<br>
Elves age extremely slowly.  You probably won't see wrinkles before they<br>
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very<br>
faint and hard to notice them for a few hundred more years.  Elven hair<br>
typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a<br>
thousand years of age, if at all.<br>
Elves have ears that are upswept and pointed.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing an Elf<br>
<br>
Elves refer to themselves not as elves, but as llewyrr; elf being a term<br>
humans devised.  All elves on Legacy's Dawning originated from the Vaasa,<br>
whether that means they were born there, their parent were, or at the<br>
most their grandparents were.  The elves of the Vaasa share a very strong<br>
sense of cohesiveness, primarily due to their status as an elder race in<br>
tune with all the forces of nature.  For this reason the elves of the<br>
Vaasa consider any elf kindred, even if that elf was born outside the<br>
Vaasa and knows nothing of it.<br>
Elves tend to hold themselves aloof from all races save other elves and<br>
occasionally ents.  Long years of dealing with dark races followed by<br>
long years of miscommunication between humans and elves (resulting in<br>
several wars, the most recent of which nearly destroyed Medienne and only<br>
ended a scant few decades ago) has caused the elves as a race to become<br>
withdrawn from other races.<br>
Elves tend to prefer nature colors of green and brown that helps them<br>
blend in to the surrounding forest.  Many elves born outside the Vaasa<br>
prefer to wear other colors chosen to display their ethereal beauty to<br>
its best advantage, another trait Vaasa born elves tend to eschew as much<br>
as calling themselves elves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
After centuries of dealing with the hostile invasions of outsides elves<br>
are quite withdrawn.  They view only elves and ents as trusted insiders.<br>
<br>
Elves consider halflings a joy of the world and view them as one might a<br>
cute child, though they offer them the respect due their age.<br>
<br>
After losing the whole of the Medienne wood, once a part of the Vaasa, to<br>
the humans and years of warfare humans and elves have only recently begun<br>
to trust one another again.  Elves consider humans a goodly race, though<br>
once betrayed are quite willing to hunt down humans on an individual<br>
basis.<br>
<br>
Elves treat lizardfolk, dwarves and gnomes with caution having little<br>
understanding of what drives them nor reason to distrust them.  As they<br>
serve the light they make good allies in a pinch and, at the least, they<br>
are less mercurial than humans.<br>
<br>
Elves hate all races that serve the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres, and<br>
trolls) but they especially loathe their close kin the Vyans.  Vyans are<br>
quite obviously related to elves though a distant schism between the two<br>
races has caused an enmity that has become the typical embodiment of<br>
light versus dark.<br>
