Humans<br>
<br>
The basic race type.  We should all be familiar with this one.<br>

        Female about 5 feet - 5 feet 10 inches on average<br>
<br>

      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)<br>

Elves<br>
<br>
Height: male about 4'8"-5'8"    (' means feet)<br>
       female about 4'6"-5'6"   (" means inches)<br>
<br>
Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white / blond ) to darkish brown.<br>
      black (very rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily<br>
      brown or blue.  Though other colors such as amber<br>
      lavender, or other light colors are not uncommon.<br>
<br>
Note: Elves have skin tones that range in most human ranges but almost<br>
always touched with a healthy glow from sunlight.  Elves almost never<br>
have pale or sickly looking skin.<br>
<br>
Note:Elves age very slowly.  You probably wont see wrinkles Before they<br>
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very<br>
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.<br>

Dwarves<br>
<br>
Height: male and female about 3'6"-4'6"<br>
<br>
Hair: primarily black to dark brown, lighter brown and<br>
      blond are rare.<br>
      ALL DWARVES (male and female) HAVE BEARDS.<br>
      (they 'could' be shaved odd daily, but such dwarves<br>
       should be ostracized by imms/players at every given<br>
       chance.  freaks. :P )<br>
<br>
Eyes: Black, brown, gray, green, and blue (rare) iris.<br>
      White around iris, though iris is large.<br>
<br>
Note: All dwarves grow facial hair.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ents<br>
<br>
Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"<br>
        females about 6'10" - 8 feet tall.<br>
<br>
Hair: Bristly or "twiggy" in earth tones.<br>
      Dark-light browns, grays, blacks, ruddy reds,<br>
      sandy-blonds.  Most ents also have "twiggy" beards.<br>
<br>
Eyes: also earthy colors. blacks, grays, browns and green<br>
      predominate though silver and green are not unheard<br>
      of.  Iris extends to edge of eye, no whites.<br>
<br>
notes: ENTS ARE NOT TREES.  Imagine a troll with brownish, craggy skin<br>
though not slimy or warty.  That's an ent.  They don't have leaves, they<br>
don't bleed sap.  Ents have 7 toes on each foot, though this need not be<br>
put in description.  Most ents have beards.  Ents have big heads.<br>

Gnomes<br>
<br>
Height: male about 3'6" - 4'6"<br>
        female about 3'4" - 4'4"<br>
<br>
Hair: most commonly darker shades of black or brown though<br>
      shades of blonde and grey are not unheard of.<br>
      A dusky red is, at best, quite rare.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green, Grey (usually dark) and black<br>
      large irises surrounded by white.  As the irises are<br>
      large, so are the pupils from years of time underground.<br>
<br>
Note: Skin tones run through all normal human ranges, though tend more<br>
ferquently to duskier hues.<br>
<br>

Halflings<br>
<br>
Height: males about 3'2" - 4'<br>
        females about 3'2" - 3'10"<br>
<br>
Hair: Mostly shades of brown, some blonde or reds.  Black (rare)<br>
      Facial hair is rare at best.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Tending towards all natural human shades.<br>
<br>
Note: Halflings appear much like human children though they do develop<br>
wrinkles, graying hair and other adult attributes.  Halflings often<br>
develop a stout build, some say due to the 5 regulated meals a day they<br>
tend to enjoy as opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend. <br>
Halflings are not hobbits.  We aren't going to ban you for having hairy<br>
feet, but realize, it is not the norm.<br>

Lizardfolk<br>
<br>
Height: male and female 5'6" - 6'2"<br>
<br>
Hair: (you're kidding, right?)  They don't grow hair.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Reptillian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an<br>
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.<br>
<br>
Notes: Lizardfolk, lacking hair for descriptions, often employ the<br>
descriptions of the various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the<br>
way a snake's scales form interesting patterns, the lizardfolk develop<br>
patterns in many tones.  Included are clans with anywhere from subdued,<br>
earthy tones to ones with vibrant hues of red, orange and yellow. <br>
Lizardfolk skin is typically soft and smooth like a snakes, though wet,<br>
fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been noted before as<br>
well.<br>

Centaurs<br>
<br>
Note: Considered a light race, but exempted from this list until such<br>
time as it may be reintroduced as a player-base option.<br>
