Average Statistics for Humans (on Legacy's Dawning)<br>
<br>
Humans are the benchmark by which all other races are measured so that<br>
we, the players, might have a means of comprehending the fantasy cultures<br>
that should be so alien to us.<br>
<br>
Height: males about 5'2"-6'<br>
        females about 5'-5'10"<br>
<br>
Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black and red.<br>
      (rarely white or gray unless elderly)<br>
<br>
Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or (rarely) Gray iris<br>
      White around the iris.<br>
<br>
Affiliation: light or dark based on alignment / how you role-play it.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Humans on Legacy's Dawning look and act just like you and I would if we<br>
lived in a fantasy realm wherein also lived fantastic creatures, magic,<br>
and danger all wrapped in the cocoon of a more-or-less medieval setting.<br>
<br>

Optional Advice for Role Playing a Human<br>
<br>
This is basically the essence of role playing in a nutshell.  You created<br>
your character, gave them form with statistics (the numbers that define<br>
your strength and wisdom, dexterity and heartiness), and determined what<br>
your occupation in this life will be.  Now it is time to breathe life<br>
into this character.  Not just by stepping forth and killing anything<br>
that gets in your way (though if you choose to do this is certainly<br>
your choice), but by figuring out what this persona you've created is<br>
like.<br>
Are they exactly like you?  Or are they braver or more timid than you? <br>
What is their favorite food?  What do they like to do when they aren't<br>
saving the world from the invading forces of darkness (or wreaking havoc<br>
upon the weak-minded fools if you are evil).  Think of all these things<br>
and what your character would be like if you met them.  Now try and<br>
portray these things by your actions and words.<br>
Want to impress someone with your role playing savvy?  Don't just walk up<br>
and say "lets go kill some ants", unless of course you already know them<br>
and are in a hurry, rather consider what you might really do.  If you ran<br>
into a total stranger in the real world dressed as a priest, would you<br>
greet him/her the same way you would greet a total stranger wearing a<br>
full military outfit?  Would you just walk up to a complete stranger in a<br>
nun's habit and say "Hey, want to go shoot some hoops at the local gym"? <br>
(If you answered yes to either of these, you might wish to seek<br>
counseling).  In most cases the answer should be no.  Neither would most<br>
characters do that.  How would you're character handle the situation? <br>
That's the basic essence of role playing.<br>
Create not just a character, but a personality to go with it.  Then take<br>
that personality and play it.  Do it consistently and you'll find<br>
situations begin to arise that you have to muddle through and you'll see<br>
your character evolving.<br>
Now, if you're just looking for a good hack-and-slash environment we can<br>
offer that too.  Just head right out and find the nearest things to kill. <br>
I'd advise using the consider command frequently in either case.  Its<br>
also a pretty bad idea to start killing townsfolk as the guards in town<br>
are a bit touchy about that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Humans have perhaps the greatest chance to meet and greet all the races<br>
as a race for they, among all the races present on Legacy's Dawning have the greatest<br>
variance of alignment and tendency to be good or evil.<br>
<br>
Humans get along best with halflings and gnomes having shared close<br>
living space with them for some time.<br>
<br>
Humans get along fairly well with dwarves and lizardfolk, though do not<br>
profess to understand them overly well as both other races are relatively<br>
secluded from the human perspective.<br>
<br>
Humans and elves only recently developed a stable relationship, having<br>
been at war off and on in the past.  Many humans still distrust the elves<br>
owing to so many years of ambushes, raids, and general mistrust that<br>
developed throughout a war that very nearly destroyed the largest human<br>
settlement, Medienne.  Throughout all this there have always been other<br>
humans willing to trust the elves for their ethereal beauty and grace<br>
that seems to set them above humans, even as others found these traits<br>
alien and frightening.<br>
<br>
Ents are considered a curiosity, sought by many as few are rarely seen. <br>
Soon after humans tend to lose interest in ents finding their slow,<br>
deliberate ways too drawn out for their tastes.<br>
<br>
Humans have peculiar dealings with orcs, with most contact between the<br>
races occurring through dealing of a very mercenary nature.  Orcs aren't<br>
the most cohesive of races and humans have had to deal with dozens of<br>
various orc tribes whose only constant factor has been a tendency towards<br>
brutish strength and barbaric vulgarity from a human perspective. <br>
Despite these social faux pas, orcs have been considered both allies and<br>
enemies from time to time.<br>
<br>
Likewise, humans have had similar dealings with ogres.  While ogres are<br>
typically considered more dangerous and more predictable only because you<br>
can only count on two things (that an ogre will be bigger than you are<br>
and more disagreeable) humans have, on occasion, hired ogres as guards or<br>
workers when their appetites for violence and food can be sated.<br>
<br>
Humans tend to avoid trolls and goblins, finding the former race too<br>
ready to eat humans regardless of how you handle them and the latter<br>
race too capricious and filthy to be trusted.  In either case the races<br>
are best avoided or pushed elsewhere to let others deal with them.<br>
<br>
Vyans, primarily because they look so much like elves, are treated with<br>
the same cautiousness if at all.  Typically only humans steeped in the<br>
darker aspects of evil culture have any dealing at all with vyans.  Those<br>
humans that lean towards the light not only distrust the vyans for their<br>
elf-like appearance, but more so for the utter acts of evil purported to<br>
be their doings.<br>
