<br>
Appearance: Lacking hair for a description, lizardfolk often employ the<br>
description of various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the way a<br>
snake's scales form interesting patterns, many lizardfolk also develop<br>
patterns.  Most often patterns are recurrent in clan members and are the<br>
primary identifying mark of a particular tribe, clan or familial group of<br>
lizardfolk.  Lizardfolk skin/scales are typically soft and smooth like a<br>
snakes, though wet, fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been<br>
noted before as well.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk have sharp claws that sometimes make grasping and manipulation<br>
a little difficult, but which prove quite useful in unarmed combat. <br>
Lizardfolk are also lacking lips and can not whistle and must improvise<br>
when calling pets.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk, as a whole, live solely in regions of swampland.  Serpentmen,<br>
a distant relative, tend to prefer the more arid desert climates. <br>

Option Advice for Role Playing Lizardfolk<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk are typically a fierce yet contemplative people who are<br>
withdrawn in dealings with any other race then their own.  They prefer<br>
the solitude of their own kind whenever possible, but will work alongside<br>
others in times of need.  Within almost every lizardperson a war is raged<br>
at all times between the hot-headed violent nature of brute survival<br>
against the contemplative wisdom of peace.  Most often it is the youths<br>
who are the fighters and warriors of a tribe, their easy anger reigned in<br>
by the wiser, older lizardfolk who act as elder guides.  It is with time<br>
and age that true wisdom and peace are acquired, quenching the rage<br>
within though never stilling the fierce strength that came with it.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk come from a tribal background where many small tribes fought<br>
with each other over territory.  It was not until two tribes managed to<br>
absorb many others and, after a fierce struggle, finally came to terms<br>
with each other and joined as one large clan that their only city of<br>
Sos-kul was built in the Kissk swamp.  Though most have formed into one<br>
homogenized clan, the scale-markings that typically identified various<br>
tribes and familial groups are still pretty pure and a developing caste<br>
system indicates that they will remain distinguishing characteristics for<br>
some time yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Lizardfolk are generally a reclusive race preferring to stick to their own<br>
kind.  Despite their misgivings, however, they have come to find that<br>
they can get along well with humans who share the same tendency towards<br>
the balance of light and dark.<br>
<br>
Though contact is quite sparse, nearly being on the other side of the<br>
known world from lizardfolk, they do get along fairly well with gnomes<br>
when contact does occur.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk do not get along very well with dwarves due to several<br>
cross-cultural differences and misunderstandings despite the faith they<br>
both place in gnomes.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk do not mix well with elves at all.  Some speculate that this<br>
stems from a past misunderstanding of temporal importance while others<br>
argue that the conflict's roots relate to religious matters.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk have even less tolerance of the elves dark cousins, the vyans. <br>
Several wars have been fought between vyans and lizardfolk in the past.<br>
<br>
Similarly, Lizardfolk do not get along well with orcs, ogres or trolls. <br>
Continued raids on lizardfolk settlements by these peoples has resulted<br>
in a strong hatred for these races by most lizardfolk.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk do not tolerate the presence of goblins, considering them<br>
nothing more than useless vermin and thieves most notable for their theft<br>
of lizardfolk eggs which they sell to vyans to be trained as slaves when<br>
they hatch.<br>
