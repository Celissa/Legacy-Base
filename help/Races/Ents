Average Statistics for Ents<br>
<br>
Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"<br>
        females about 6'10" - 8' tall.<br>
<br>
Hair: Bristly or "twiggy" in earthy tones<br>
      Primarily dark to light browns, red-brown, sandy-blond and<br>
      shades of gray and sometimes black.<br>
      Most ents, but not all, including females have bristly/twiggy beards.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Also in earthy colors.  Blacks, grays, browns and greens<br>
      predominate though silver and gold are not unheard of.<br>
      Their iris extends to the edge of the eye (no white exposed).<br>
<br>
Affiliation: Ents are a light race and are restricted to good aligment.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Ents have craggy, tough skin that is usually a dark brown and<br>
looks surprisingly like troll skin (only without the warts, bristly hair,<br>
or slime).  Ents have wide feet with seven toes on each foot but ents<br>
still only have 5 fingers on each hand.  Ents tend to have bulky physical<br>
forms (unless you've given your character a very low strength and<br>
constitution).  Ents are not treants and do not have bark, sap or leaves.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing an Ent<br>
<br>
The ent is the largest of the humanoids that tends towards the side of<br>
light and goodness and, as such, most are slow to anger realizing their<br>
great size and strength can cause great devastation and they would not<br>
want to cause undue harm to innocents by mistake.  Somewhere in the<br>
time-shrouded past ents became the primary caretakers of the plants of<br>
the ancient forests, primarily the Vaasa, and they usually live<br>
peacefully among the elves of the wood.  Most ents are slow to speak or<br>
act as they have long life-spans and have lived so long tending the great<br>
and ancient plants of the Vaasa that they have become accustomed to the<br>
slow pace of life, having time to consider without rash action.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
After long association with the elves of the Vaasa, ents consider them<br>
good friends.<br>
<br>
Somewhere in the past ents and halfling met and each seem to share<br>
stories about the other race and consider each other good folk.  Ents<br>
find great amusement in watching the apparantly hasty, but good-natured<br>
doings of halflings.<br>
<br>
Ents deal fairly well with gnomes and dwarves as they are usually known to<br>
serve the forces of light and goodness, though ents tend to readily admit<br>
they do not understand these ground-dwelling races.<br>
<br>
Ents deal with humans and lizardfolk fairly as well and more frequently<br>
than gnomes and dwarves.  Most often humans and lizardfolk are dealt with<br>
on a case by case basis as both races seem to fall squarely in the middle<br>
of the matter of light versus dark.<br>
<br>
Being a race that so whole-heartedly accepted the tenets of light, ents<br>
typically abhor any race that serves the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres,<br>
trolls and vyans) and would be hard-pressed to come to simple terms with<br>
one who professed to have a goodly nature.  In time, perhaps, a member of<br>
the dark races could prove themselves to an ent, but far too frequently<br>
such tactics have been little more than ploys to wreak more havoc upon<br>
ents or elves.<br>
