Dwarven beard rings and their signifigance<br>
  <br>
The diminutive race of peoples know collectively as the race of dwarves<br>
share several common traits that mark their race as a whole.  Among these<br>
traits are their shorter stature than that of most other races, a hearty<br>
endurance, generally a strong work ethic, and the ever-present beard<br>
found on both sexes.  While some races generally find facial hair to be<br>
repugnant, the dwarves all take their beards quite seriously.  To the<br>
dwarven peoples the loss of a beard to mishap is nearly viewed as being<br>
more heinous to the individual than even the loss of a limb.  The dwarf<br>
who chooses to shave off his beard risks becoming an outcast among his or<br>
her own people who will wonder what is fundamentally wrong with the<br>
individual.<br>
 <br>
Needless to say, that among such strong feelings about their beards,<br>
beard fashion would tend to become a subject of interest.  An early<br>
forerunner in the beard fashion parade was, and remains the twin braids. <br>
Among other schools of thought single braids, multiple braids, unbraided,<br>
and countless cuts and styles are also popular.  One underlying precept<br>
that took hold early on, and continues to be a highly esteemed practice<br>
among the dwarven peoples is the fashion of the beard ring.  Having taken<br>
a strong hold as a consistent fashion statement, the upper eschelon of<br>
dwarves managed to orchestrate the whims of fashion to serve a practical<br>
purpose.  Over centuries fashion became custom and the plain unmarked<br>
rings have become symbols of ones status within dwarven society.<br>
   <br>
Though the dwarves talk little of it to outsiders, considering it<br>
something of personal matter, outsiders have learned the following things. <br>
There are seven metal types used to mark the various levels of<br>
achievement: bronze, copper, silver, gold, platinum, steel, and mithril. <br>
Young dwarves are not permitted to wear the rings at all until they have<br>
proven themselves by act and deed.  Once proven experienced enough to be<br>
a member of society, the dwarven individual is permitted to wear the<br>
bronze rings.  As individuals earn honor and achievement they are<br>
permitted to purchase rings that mark the gaining of prestige among their<br>
kindred.  Most dwarves eagerly await the day when they can purchase their<br>
first set of rings and strives to improve their standing every day of<br>
their life.  Only a select few have ever been accorded the honor to wear<br>
the mithril rings, and there is even a dwarven legend of one great<br>
dwarven warrior who so embodied the dwarven ethic and achievement that he<br>
was accorded a set of liridium beard rings.<br>
