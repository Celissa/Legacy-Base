Average Statistics for Dwarves<br>
<br>
Height: male and female about 3'6" - 4'6"<br>
<br>
Hair: primarily black to dark brown, lighter brown<br>
      and blond are rare.  Gray in old age.<br>
      ALL DWARVES (male and female) HAVE BEARDS.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Black, brown, gray, green, and rarely blue iris.<br>
      White around the iris, though the iris is large.<br>
<br>
Dwarves are a light race, and restricted to good and neutral alignment.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Dwarves are noted primarily for two traits.<br>
First, dwarves are shorter than humans and have broad shoulders.<br>
Second, all dwarves have beards.  While you could possibly shave every<br>
day, every other dwarf is encouraged to shun, taunt and torment beardless<br>
dwarves at every given opportunity.<br>
Dwarves tend to have hearty, strong appearances and are generally adapted<br>
to living in the harsh conditions of the northern Cairn mountains.  They<br>
frequently have dusky, leathery looking skin that protects them from both<br>
chill wind, glaring sun and rugged terrain.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing a Dwarf<br>
<br>
Dwarves come from a culture that cherishes two things above all others. <br>
Family and work.  Most dwarves will place family and clan above friends. <br>
Sure, a human makes a good aquaintence, but if it came to a choice of<br>
friends of family, family will win hands down every time.<br>
Since family is rarely threatened, except maybe by orc or goblin raids in<br>
the mountains, outsiders more often see the dwarven work ethic come into<br>
play.  A pride in work done, most often with the hands.  In many cases<br>
this means well cared for equipment, fine smithing (one of major exports<br>
of the main dwarven citadel, Kha-da) and a belief that a job worth doing<br>
is worth doing right.<br>
Most other races will see dwarves as obstinate and gruff.  These are more<br>
realisticly just the visual appearance of their ethics.  If something<br>
falls into a category their ethics already cover, it takes little thought<br>
and there is almost no chance of changing a dwarf's mind once its made up<br>
on such a basis.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Dwarves prize other dwarves above all else, making for a pretty gruff<br>
appearance at best to outsiders they do like, let alone ones they don't.<br>
<br>
Dwarves have an undying hatred for several races - among them goblins,<br>
orcs, trolls and ogres.  Of these all, dwarves can not stand goblins who<br>
are, to them, less than worthless theives who should be burried under the<br>
next collapsed tunnel.<br>
<br>
Vyans are perceived as a particularly sinister threat due to their<br>
obvious intelligence and particularly vile brand of evil.<br>
<br>
Elves are viewed with a measure of skepticism, at times bordering on<br>
contempt.  Severe differences in dwarven and elven attitude make elves<br>
seem capricious and frivolous, something no self-respecting dwarf would<br>
find desirable (see notes on dwarven work ethic).<br>
<br>
Humans, on the whole, are seen as unnecessarily volatile and a race which<br>
really hasn't finished its adolesence, grown up, or figured out what it<br>
wants to do with itself.<br>
<br>
Lizardmen are considered somewhat of a boggle for dwarves, sharing no<br>
common territories of cultural ideologies that would bring them closer<br>
together or further apart.<br>
<br>
Gnomes are considered to be most agreeable, sensible folks closest to<br>
dwarves in attitude and demeaner.<br>
<br>
Halflings are considered somewhat reliable if a bit too care-free and are<br>
viewed somewhere between gnomes and humans.  While they can be sensible<br>
folk when it comes to settling down and tilling the earth or working, and<br>
they don't just rush into things, they are just so darned merry all the<br>
time even when there's no good reason to be.<br>
