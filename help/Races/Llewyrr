  The llewyrr live in the Mighty Vaasa, which lies over a range of<br>
mountains to the northeast of Medienna.  The Vaasa is the mightiest<br>
forest known, and dwarfs all others in its size, age, and grandeur. <br>
Llewyrr tend to dress in forest colors and have straight hair running<br>
from dark browns to blonds.  Elven eyes are always striking, and come in<br>
more shades and varieties than even those of human.<br>
<br>
.  The llewyrr have come to have very distinct characteristics which have<br>
come to depict them, and them only.  Their general attitude towards life<br>
deviates from that of many others; they believe in the sacredness that<br>
all things: elven, human, animal, plant, rock, or soil.  Only those who<br>
kill or destroy out of reasons other than necessity of survival are<br>
considered lessers.  Over the years, however, there has come to be a<br>
large generalization that all races other than elven kill needlessly and<br>
destroy nature, and so are lessers.  Several radical factions of llewyrr<br>
have been known to massacare humans and other nearby races for seemingly<br>
no reason.<br>
<br>
.  Often it is possible to tell the specific beliefs followed by a<br>
llewyrr by the beads woven into his or her hair.  This is definately not<br>
true for all though, as many simply choose their own path to follow.<br>
