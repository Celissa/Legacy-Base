Appearance: Halflings look quite like human children until they reach<br>
maturity.  They do develop wrinkles, graying hair and other human<br>
attributes, only they retain their shorter stature.  Halflings most often<br>
develop a stout build, some say due to the minimum of 5 meals a day they<br>
tend to enjoy as opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend.  For<br>
those with prior role playing experience; halflings are not hobbits.  We<br>
aren't going to ban you for having hairy feet, but realize, it is not the<br>
norm.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing a Halfling<br>
<br>
Halflings are typically good natured, care-free folk who are more<br>
interested in settling down and enjoying life rather than adventuring. <br>
Since the idea of the game is to adventure, this means you are most<br>
probably playing a halfling that is not quite that normal.  A normal<br>
"adventuring" halfling is one who still values the good things in life:<br>
good meals, good company, and cheerful surroundings.  Halflings are so<br>
steeped in the realm of light and goodness (they can be no alignment but<br>
good) that they tend to brighten any place they can go with a desire to<br>
bring simple goodness with them.<br>
The ideal adventure for your typical non-adventuring halfling would be<br>
settingling down with friends in a nice tavern to tell tales and discuss<br>
adventures while sharing food and drink.  Your average adventuring<br>
halfling, while finding the same pursuit equally exciting, tends to want<br>
to go see these places for themselves as well as talk about them.<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Halflings, though typically shy around non-halflings, are found quite<br>
frequently among dwarven and human settlements having insinuated<br>
themselves quite merrily into both cultures.<br>
<br>
Halflings tend to view elves with some awe, seeing in them their goodness<br>
and ethereal beauty.  The fact that elves treat halflings as cheerful<br>
little icons of goodness doesn't hurt either.  Halflings view ents in<br>
much the same manner.<br>
<br>
Gnomes are viewed as distant cousins as many of the same living<br>
environments have been shared over time and few quarrels have resulted<br>
over it.<br>
<br>
Halflings detest goblins and orcs, the former race being nothing more<br>
than a disruptive nuisance and the latter treating them no better than<br>
they tend to treat goblin slaves.  Confrontations between these races<br>
tends to be short and bloody.  Vyans are also grouped into this category.<br>
<br>
Ogres tend to avoid halflings as the small race tends to annoy the large,<br>
slow ogres.<br>
<br>
Halflings tend to avoid trolls, as they look like a nice feast to most<br>
trolls.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk are viewed with as a curiosity, halflings having rare contact<br>
with them and no basis for understanding the culture at all.<br>
