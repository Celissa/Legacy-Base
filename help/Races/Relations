<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The political relations between and among clans here are volatile and<br>
dynamic, and are shaped by two key times: a natural proclivity toward peace<br>
or war between two clans, and the actions of members of each of the clans<br>
toward members of others. For example, Khedrun and Eleint are inclined to<br>
ally, but continuous pejorative actions between the two will ultimately<br>
plunge them into war.<br>
<br>
The relations table show the following values, in descending order from<br>
harmony to abhorrence:<br>
<br>
        "+++"    Harmony     \<br>
        " ++"    Accord       -  Peace<br>
        " + "    Ease        /<br>
        " = "    Tense<br>
        " - "    Strife      \<br>
        " --"    Discord      - War<br>
        "---"    Abhorrence  /<br>
