Average Statistics for Orcs<br>
<br>
Height: males about 5'2" - 6'6"<br>
        females about 5' - 6'6"<br>
<br>
Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greatest of manes.  What hair does grow<br>
      tends to be black and coarse.  Occasional shades of dark brown or<br>
      the infrequent shade of ruddy reddish-brown do occur.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises.  The area around the<br>
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.<br>
<br>
Affiliation: orcs are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic<br>
neutral alignments.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Orcs frequently have dusky-hued skin tending towards shades<br>
of brown or red.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered<br>
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's more pathetic than smooth, boring skin.<br>
<br>
Orcs are not known for their great dental hygiene and often have cracked,<br>
yellowed and missing teeth.  Fortunately for them they often grow back<br>
missing teeth once lost.  Enlarged tusk-like canines often protrude from<br>
the lower jaw noticeably.  Their noses are typically upturned, giving them<br>
a pig-like or boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of the<br>
so-called good races.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing an Orc<br>
<br>
Orcs are typically slow and a bit dumb, never the less they know how to<br>
be tough, wily and strong foes worthy of respect.  Orcs primarily dwell<br>
underground and, though they can tolerate sunlight, prefer not to and<br>
will assuredly whine at being made to spend time in the light.  Their<br>
long years of growing as a society in the cramped tunnels and caves left<br>
to them as the hand-me-downs of larger, brutish dark races or the more<br>
cunning vyans has produced some pretty strong traits.  Most orcs are not<br>
shy or withdrawn and prefer to take what they can get.  This makes for a<br>
very combative society and one that has learned to take its own abuse. <br>
Their favorite hobby would have to be tormenting the goblins that somehow<br>
always manage to be present wherever there are orcs.  Its considered<br>
great sport, after all, they just keep taking the abuse and there are<br>
always more.<br>
After years of living this way, orcs finally came into contact with<br>
humans.  Though brutal at first, some orcs did see the advantage to<br>
living above ground in artificial caves (houses), particularly if you<br>
build them without windows, thus keeping sunlight out.  When this faction<br>
left, leaving more space in the caves, the remaining orcs rejoiced<br>
greatly and proceeded to fight over the extra free space.  The split, over<br>
many years, has caused orcs to evolve into two main groups.  An eastern<br>
orc, seen most commonly around Voaleth, who tend to be more tribal,<br>
chaotic and senselessly brutal.  And a western orc, seen most commonly<br>
around Brithbarad, known to be somewhat larger and more cunning in their<br>
brutal plots.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Orcs are known to to be none to fond of elves, finding their best value<br>
to be the way they bleed so easily when cut, pounded or smashed.<br>
Elves are also a good supply of elven teeth, which make fine keepsakes of<br>
memorable raids on the unwary elf hunting party.<br>
<br>
Despite their close resemblance to elves, orcs grudgingly respect vyans. <br>
After all, how bad can a people who slaughter elves even more than you do<br>
be?<br>
<br>
Dwarves and gnomes only have value as slaves, food or both in orcish eyes.<br>
<br>
Orcs are generally on amiable terms with Ogres, seeing them as little<br>
more than really large orcs.<br>
<br>
Goblins, having turned out to be poor slaves who were too weak and lazy<br>
as workers and too inconsistent in work quality, and about as hard to get<br>
rid of as roaches turned out to be almost adequate allies.  They make for<br>
great fodder in a fight and are a nearly endless source of mirth as the<br>
butt of jokes and target of cruelty.  They just keep taking it and there<br>
are always more.  When you break one, there always seems to be two more<br>
ready to take its place.<br>
<br>
Orcs and trolls do not tend to get along well at all, always managing to<br>
find something to fight over (usually involving possessions or food),<br>
except when hunting elves.<br>
<br>
Humans are an odd lot and are alternately tolerated and hated by orcs<br>
depending on whatever the current leaders' whims seem to be.  Where some<br>
humans serve the dark forces they tend to make good allies, while humans<br>
that serve the light are bothersome nuisances and frequently go the way<br>
of elves.  Which is to say they end up a smear on some orc's war club.<br>
<br>
Lizardfolk remain a nearly complete enigma.  They lived in the swamps<br>
and, as everyone knows, there aren't caves under a swamp, just more swamp. <br>
Worse than that, there are only two ways to get there.  Through human<br>
lands, and the humans keep stopping orcs to fight or talk, either one is<br>
better than walking all day.  Or through the Vaasa, and there are just so<br>
many elves to kill there's never a good enough reason to get to the other<br>
side of the Vaasa.  Why go through when you can stop half way and just<br>
keep killing elves until you're ready to go home?<br>
