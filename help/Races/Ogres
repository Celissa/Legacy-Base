Average Statistics for Ogres<br>
<br>
Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"<br>
        females about 6'4" - 7'2"<br>
<br>
Hair: Browns, black, reds and rarely gray.<br>
      It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.<br>
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though<br>
      ear, nose, shoulder and back hair are quite common.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors that are mainly<br>
      shades of gray.  Sometimes they have hints of red or black as well.<br>
      The Irises are large leaving only a thin margin of the sallow to gray<br>
      surrounding it visible.<br>
<br>
Alignment: Ogres are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic<br>
neutral alignments.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Ogres are most often quite muscular with odd protuberances,<br>
large warts and cysts most frequently, as well as having frequent patches<br>
of hair-covered warts that can confuse their bulky shape.  Most ogres<br>
have poor postures and stoop horrendously.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky<br>
shade of grey-brown, sandy-brown, or a ruddy red-brown but it is always<br>
somewhat rubbery.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing an Ogre<br>
<br>
As a general rule, ogres are big, mean and dumb.  They are typically<br>
brutish and like to bash anything smaller them as much as possible.  They<br>
particularly don't like little creatures, who tend to cause problems<br>
and/or steal things.  The general attitude of life for an ogre is pretty<br>
simple.  If you can eat it, do so.  If you don't plan on eating it, bully<br>
it.  If you can't bully it, then smash it.<br>
<br>
Ogres aren't known as great conversationalists, but they are the favored<br>
workhorse of the dark armies being the best at what is most often called<br>
for in any combat situation.  Smash, rend and tear into itty-bitty pieces.<br>
<br>
Ogres have no real central governing force, nor do they care overly much<br>
for family units.  Despite the lack of central cohesiveness, they still<br>
managed to construct a city, Denab-Knur (The ogre words for Cave you live<br>
in, further demonstrating their creative genius).  True to form, city<br>
government is based on strength.  The strong rule and the weak serve.<br>
<br>
Two varieties of ogre have evolved here.  Gray ogres tend to be the<br>
stronger and dumber of the two.  Red Ogres, so called for the ruddy hue<br>
of their rubbery skin, are somewhat smaller in stature and possess a<br>
smidge more intelligence than grey ogres, they are still about as smart<br>
as a rock by the standards of most other races.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
<br>
As a rule ogres dislike anything small.  Halflings, gnomes, dwarves and<br>
goblins are all treated with contempt and should be stomped on repeatedly. <br>
Goblins, at least, know how to tear things apart and can, on rare<br>
occasion, be useful in breaking something in a small places ogres can't<br>
reach.<br>
<br>
Trolls, though strange and frankly, pretty dumb even by ogre standards,<br>
make for useful allies.<br>
<br>
Orcs are viewed with a measure of respect, as they know how to cut and<br>
build things, though they obviously aren't as good as ogres or they<br>
wouldn't be so puny.<br>
<br>
Vyans make useful allies, as they make good diversions when hunting elves<br>
and are good at dealing with elven magic.  Unfortunately they are also a<br>
nuisance as they always seem to think they are in charge.  Fortunately<br>
they rarely get in the way of such truly important matters as smashing<br>
things when it comes time to do so.<br>
<br>
Elves and lizardmen are hated simply as a matter of course.  They serve<br>
no purpose but they do bleed exceedingly well once you get past all their<br>
silly magic and sharp claws.<br>
<br>
Humans are an odd lot.  While some are almost as good as orcs, many more<br>
are often as bad as elves and lizardmen.  Though its usually just easier<br>
to smash them the same as elves, sometimes it pays off to only smash them<br>
a little.  Once they know who's boss, they make pretty good allies.<br>
