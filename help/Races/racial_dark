Humans<br>
<br>
The basic race type, we should all be familiar with this one.<br>
<br>
Height: Male about 5 feet 2 inches - 6 feet tall on average<br>
        Female about 5 feet- 5 feet 10 inches on average<br>
<br>
Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black, red<br>
      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)<br>
<br>
Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or Gray (rare) iris<br>
      White around the iris unless very sick.<br>

Vyan<br>
<br>
Height: male about 4'8"-5'8"     (' means feet)<br>
        female about 4'6"-5'6"   (" means inches)<br>
<br>
Hair: typically stright. Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.<br>
      brown or blond (extremely rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily<br>
      violet or amber.  Though other colors such as brilliant blues<br>
      or grays to black are not uncommon.<br>
<br>
Note: Skin tones range primarily from midnight black to pale, wan colors. <br>
The vyan with the healthy glow of sun burnished skin is almost completely<br>
unheard of.<br>
<br>
Note: Vyans age very slowly.  You probaby won't see wrinkles before they<br>
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very<br>
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.<br>
<br>

Orcs<br>
<br>
Height: males about 5'2" - 6'6"<br>
        females about 5' - 6'6"<br>
<br>
Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greates of manes. What hair does grow<br>
      tends to be black and coarse.  Ocassional shade of dark brown<br>
      or the infrequent shade of ruddy redish-brown do occur.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises. The area around the<br>
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.<br>
<br>
Note: Orcs frequently have dusky-hues skin tending towards shades of<br>
browns and reds.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered<br>
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's worse than plain smooth, boring skin.<br>
<br>
Note: Orcs have poor dental hiegene but also have hearty teeth that often<br>
grow in once lost.  Enlarged, tusk-like canines often protrude from the<br>
lower jaw noticably.  Noses are often upturned, giving them a pig-like or<br>
boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of so-called good<br>
races.<br>

Ogres<br>
<br>
Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"<br>
        females about 6'4" - 7'2"<br>
<br>
Hair: Ogres have hair most frequently in browns, blacks, and reds<br>
      and rarely gray.  It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.<br>
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though<br>
      ear and nose hair as well as shoulder and back hair are common.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors of mainly<br>
      greys.  Sometimes hints of red or black have appeared though rarely.<br>
      Irises are large leaving only a little of the sallow to gray<br>
      surrounding the eyes visible.<br>
<br>
Note: Ogres are often muscular, but odd protuberances as well as frequent<br>
patches of hair-covered warts can confuse the bulky shape.  Most ogres<br>
have poor posture.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky shade of grey-brown,<br>
sandy brown, or ruddy red-brown and is always somewhat rubbery.<br>
<br>

Trolls<br>
<br>
Height: males about 6'4" - 7'4"<br>
        females about 6'6" - 7' 6"<br>
<br>
Hair: Swamp trolls tend to black hair, not always on their<br>
      head.  Where hair grows it is either greasy or coarse.<br>
      Ice trolls tend to have white hair, with at least<br>
      some on their head more so than elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.<br>
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.<br>
<br>
Note: Trolls have green skin in varying hues (though none are what would<br>
be termed bright, neon, or electric green), They are often warty or have<br>
cancerous appearing growths though these do not seem to affect their<br>
health negatively in any way, rather it appears to be an excess of their<br>
ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost never have scars, as they heal so<br>
incredibly well.  For a race that is typically foul, corupt and evil they<br>
have the incongruous gift of incredible regeneration at the cost of a<br>
never-ending hunger.<br>

Goblins<br>
<br>
Height: males and females about 3'6" - 4'4"<br>
<br>
Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.<br>
      What hair they do grow is usually black or brown and often<br>
      caked in muck and fiflth.  Goblins have no facial hair.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are primarily<br>
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of<br>
      dark brown or reddish-brown.  The iris extends to the edge<br>
      of the eye with only a pupil which dilates between a pinprick<br>
      in size to a large circle as lighting permits.<br>
<br>
Note: Goblins have craggy skin in colors of earthy greens and browns or<br>
patchy/mottled earthtone mixes.  Though they have warts and protuberances<br>
less frequently than orcs, ogres, and trolls they are not completely<br>
infrequent in some clans.  Goblins tend to have sharp teeth, though they<br>
are small and wouldn't ordinarily be called fangs.<br>
