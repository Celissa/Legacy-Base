Average Statistics for Vyans (aka Dark Elves)<br>
<br>
Height: males about 4'8" - 5'8"<br>
        females about 4'6" - 5'6"<br>
<br>
Hair: typically straight.  Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.<br>
      Extremely rarely brown or blond.  Vyans have no facial hair.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily<br>
      violet or amber.  Other colors, such as brilliant blues or<br>
      anything from gray to black are also not uncommon.<br>
<br>
Affiliation: vyans are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic<br>
neutral aligments.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Vyans look much like humans though they generally have a<br>
smaller, more slender build than humans.  Vyans tend to have smooth<br>
unblemished skin ranging from midnight black to pale, wan colors and<br>
ashen castes.  The vyan with the healthy glow of sun burnished skin is<br>
almost completely unheard of.  Despite their apperance as a result of<br>
living primarily underground for countless centuries, vyans tend to<br>
possess a beauty to equal that of elves.  Their dark beauty has drawn in<br>
many an unwary victim who later fell pray to whatever schemes the vyans<br>
were planning.  You probably won't see wrinkles on a vyan before they<br>
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very<br>
faint and hard to notice for a few hundred more years.  Vyan hair<br>
typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a<br>
thousand years of age, if at all.  Like elves, vyans have upswept,<br>
pointed ears.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing a Vyan<br>
<br>
Vyans are a haughty race, indeed perhaps the most haughty of all races. <br>
They will refer to themselves as vyans or simply as The People, as they view<br>
any other race as chattel to be used or destroyed at a whim and with no<br>
more remorse than if they were objects.  They believe it is their<br>
divinely given right to rule and they very nearly manage to succeed.<br>
<br>
If playing a normal vyan, it might be suggested that you imply that you,<br>
or another vyan, is the undisputed leader of any group you are in.  If<br>
anyone disputes this you should probably follow them into the nearest<br>
playerkilling zone and kill them or have a loyal minion kill them in your<br>
name.  After all, it is divine will that ordains your rulership.  Just<br>
don't confuse leadership with tanking (being the one who takes all the<br>
hits in a group).  That's what sturdy minions are for, preferably ogres<br>
and trolls, who are just big dumb brutes adapted to taking such beatings.<br>
<br>
Vyans hate to be called dark elves.  Once, long ago the elves and the<br>
vyans may have shared common ancestors, but the elves have proven to be<br>
weak fool relying on the good will of life where they should accept their<br>
role as an elder race along with the vyans and rule through power.  Long<br>
wars have developed due to the rift in elven and vyan philosophies and<br>
there is no hope of a peace ever developing now.  To call a vyan an elf,<br>
even a dark elf, is to imply that they are weak and foolish.  Ideally<br>
only other vyans should be permited to even speak to you, however, on<br>
those occasions when a minion must speak with you they should refer to<br>
you as master.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
As the only true people, vyans view every other race with some measure of<br>
contempt, though some more than others.<br>
<br>
Trolls, Ogres and Orcs make good minions and cannon fodder in a fight.<br>
<br>
Goblins are a nuisance best destroyed unless you have raised them from<br>
birth to be subserviant slaves.<br>
<br>
Humans, while occasionally producing a few dark-minded folk who can serve<br>
as good as ogres, trolls and orcs, are primarily still pretty useless and<br>
are better destroyed than ignored before they get lucky and find some way<br>
to cause trouble.<br>
<br>
Dwarves, halflings, and gnomes typically serve the force of light and<br>
should be destroyed outright as they are meddlesome nuisances.<br>
<br>
Elves have become the bane of vyan existence.  These close cousins embody<br>
all the weak, pathetic ideas that the vyan nation finally overcame and<br>
cast off.  An unending war has raged for countless centuries between<br>
these two races that emobody the paths of light and dark.<br>
<br>
Ents, as servants of the light and close allies of elves are hated, but<br>
only about as much as one could be said to hate a dangerous animal.  They<br>
are dangerous, but they aren't really people.  If not for the fact they<br>
aid the elves much in the same way ogres and trolls are of use to the<br>
vyans, ents would be a concern that could be left off for a later, more<br>
convenient date.<br>
