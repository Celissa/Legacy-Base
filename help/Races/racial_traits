To help people figure out what things are required to be in or left out<br>
of their appearance and desc, based on their race I came up with a<br>
compendium of information for the races.  Unfortunately, it gets a bit<br>
long.  To help facilitate the two, I've divided the list into racial_dark<br>
and racial_light.<br>
these are not necessarily mandatory, but they should give you an idea<br>
what the normal is.  Where something is mandatory it should be somewhat<br>
notable (ie elves don't grow facial hair, ents are not trees, all dwarves<br>
grow facial hair (notice I said grow, not have) ).<br>
<br>
(light races begin the game in the human/light town of Chiiron)<br>
(dark races begin the game in the dark town of Voaleth)<br>
