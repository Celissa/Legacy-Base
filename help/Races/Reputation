This world of this mud is divided into several races which have a<br>
propensity to war.  You have a reputation for each race.  If you attack<br>
members of that race your reputation will drop.  Members include player<br>
characters, guards, citizens, and shop keepers.  But races at war with<br>
the race you attacked will approve of your action and your reputation with<br>
them will go up.  To see your reputations type "reputation".  To see the<br>
relations between the different races type "relations".  You should<br>
becareful of attacking town guards as they will summon help if given the<br>
oppurtunity.  A list of characters who are wanted by clan can be<br>
shown under the command "wanted".  If you kill one of them and bring the<br>
corpse back to your town you can collect a bounty from the local<br>
officials.  <br>
