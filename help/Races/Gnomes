Optional Advice on Role Playing a Gnome<br>
<br>
Gnomes are considered to be small, industrious workers and are known to<br>
produce excellent spell-casters.  In temperament they are indeed<br>
industrious as well as curious.  They tend to have an innate curiosity<br>
about how things work and want to disassemble, study and reassemble<br>
anything that can be taken apart, fixed or improved.  It is this<br>
curiosity, coupled with their tendency to study the most minute details<br>
to death, that has lead to the fame of many a gnome wizard or inventor.<br>
<br>
Gnomes are most comfortable living in an underground city or burrow, or in<br>
a small home on a rolling hill in some bucolic country setting.  In the<br>
past, most gnomes lived around their great underground city of Orlumber<br>
and conducted trade with humans in both Pennan and Narak and the dwarves<br>
of Kha-da.  Since the destruction of Orlumber by vyans the gnomes have<br>
moved to wherever the manage to feel comfortable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
Sharing a number of traits with them, gnomes tend to get along best with<br>
dwarves and mix well in settings suited to both races, though not without<br>
the occasional misunderstanding or cross-cultural problem.<br>
<br>
To gnomes, the elves are a complete mystery.  Elven behavior is<br>
considered inexplicable, mystifying and frustrating to most gnomes. <br>
Their most redeeming quality is the fact that they typically serve the<br>
light, and thus, oppose those races that most often like to prey on<br>
gnomes.<br>
<br>
Gnomes have an even less positive contact with vyans, the dark elves, who<br>
in past times have appeared out of nowhere to ravage and destroy the<br>
works of the gnomes (including Orlumber).<br>
<br>
Orcs, ogres, trolls and goblins come just behind vyans on the gnomes'<br>
list of least favorite peoples.  Gnomes have a particular distaste for<br>
goblins and categorically deny all claims that there is any similarity<br>
between the two races.<br>
<br>
Much like elves, gnomes are hard-pressed to understand the motives of<br>
lizardfolk thus the dealings between the two races are infrequent and<br>
cautious.<br>
<br>
Having insinuated themselves into human culture, gnomes have managed to<br>
come to an easy peace with most humans and deal well with them.  After<br>
all, humans travel wide and far and often manage to bring back<br>
information and interesting things that gnomes just love to study.<br>
