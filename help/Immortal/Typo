typo [message]<br>

<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
This command is used to link a message to a specific room and is used for<br>
noting typos in descriptions or errors in that rooms specific actions. <br>
It can only be seen while in the room you post the message and only by<br>
immortals, so it is of no use if you post it ten rooms after you notice<br>
the mistake or if you notice a mistake on a wandering creature.<br>
<br>
In the case of typos in rooms that are out of the way, on mobile creatures<br>
and on items it is best to post a note on the bugs board.  If you do not<br>
know about the bugs board check under help noteboard.  If a note is related<br>
to a specific room, you can use the typo command to get the room number<br>
which should be included in your note.<br>
