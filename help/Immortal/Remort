Upon reaching level ninety, a player will be given a personalized<br>
object with twenty-five free levels of affects.  The player will<br>
determine at which level he wants to be able to use the item and what<br>
affects he wants to be included on it, then it will be adjusted to fit<br>
standards by the immortal in charge of objects.  The player will also be<br>
able to determine what sort of item they want it to be, such as weapon,<br>
armor, mana or regen item...basically anything that is a current affect<br>
can be added as long as it doesn't exceed the number of affect levels.<br>
The remorting player may also keep 50 platinum from their bank.<br>
