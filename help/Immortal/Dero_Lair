Perhaps kin to dwarves or gnomes, the diminutive dero lack any of the<br>
artisan skills of either.  Instead, they make a living by murder and<br>
thievery, challenging even the ratkin in brutality and mischief making. <br>
Sunlight they hate, all other races they hate, only pausing to kill, eat<br>
or enslave anyone they run across.  Despite their size, they have a giant<br>
appetite when it comes to precious metals and gems, putting slaves - even<br>
the lesser of their own kin - to work in mines to extract what they can<br>
not steal.  Lead by a vicious war leader, packs of dero sulk in the<br>
darkness of forgotten catacombs and caverns, waiting for their next<br>
victim.<br>
