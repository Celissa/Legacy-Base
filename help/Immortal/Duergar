<br>
Hair: Primarily shades of grey from medium to dark, rarely any lighter. <br>
Some older Duergar have been known to have their hair go white, but this<br>
is rare and considered a throw back to their Dwarven origins.<br>
All Duergar have thick grey beards matching the colour of their hair,<br>
though it has become the trend among many Duergar to shave the top lip<br>
lending their beard more of a face-framing quality.<br>
<br>
Eyes: Shades of grey, occasionally so dark as to appear black.  Rarely<br>
any lighter than medium grey.<br>
<br>
Appearance: Duergar differ from their dwarven cousins in many key areas. <br>
Their skin is almost exclusively a mid grey in colour, generally a shade<br>
or two lighter than their hair but rarely altering far to the darker or<br>
lighter side from mid grey.  Duergar are quite a bit thinner than<br>
dwarves, less broad across the shoulder and often less muscular.<br>

Optional Advice on Role Playing a Duergar<br>
<br>
Duergar are considered an evil race by many, and though one may find the<br>
occasional individual with a more neutral calling in life you would never<br>
find a Duergar supporting the cause of good.<br>
Duergar society exists underground, and as such most duergar will have<br>
spent the vast majority of their lives underground, giving rise to an<br>
innate fear and distrust of all surface dwelling creatures.  Living<br>
underground has also made the duergar most comfortable in darkness to the<br>
extent that they will go out of their way to avoid exposing themselves to<br>
excess light, particularly the daytime.<br>
The influence this has had on the duergar as a race is marked, they are<br>
most comfortable sneaking around and keeping to the shadows whenever<br>
possible, lending to the rather natural feeling of distrust that they<br>
provoke in most other races.<br>
<br>
Racial Relations:<br>
<br>
Duergar have inherited the ability (talent?) to hold a grudge to the<br>
extreme from their cousins the dwarves.<br>
<br>
Dwarves cannot be abided.  Duergar and dwarves hold a deepset and<br>
unyielding hatred of everything the other embodies.  Other light races<br>
are viewed with suspicion, although the duergar's withdrawn society means<br>
that they have had little contact with these races and as such have not<br>
had an opportunity to build up any substantial grudge.<br>
<br>
Vyans are feared and mistrusted due to a past history ivolving<br>
inslavement of the duergar by the vyans.<br>
<br>
Goblins are the only race with which the duergar have friendly relations<br>
due to colaberation in the past and the duergar's innate feeling of<br>
superiority over goblinkind.<br>
