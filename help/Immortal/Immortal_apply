Applying for an immortal position:<br>
<br>
The position you will be applying for is Apprentice, where you will help<br>
other immortals build and maintain areas, as well as build your own area.<br>
<br>
STEP ONE:<br>
Mudmail to Guin a short description of an area idea.  Remember that<br>
the theme of this mud is medieval fantasy, though possibly more fantasy.<br>
Include in your mudmail, which should be no more than 60 lines, some sample<br>
room descriptions in your area.<br>
<br>
STEP TWO:<br>
If your application is intriguing and your writing ability adequate, you<br>
will likely be asked to submit a longer application via email and<br>
possibly asked to Avatar for a trial period.<br>
<br>
NOTE:<br>
An immortal position is NOT an invitation to party and otherwise goof<br>
off.  You are applying to work.  Moreover, you will be logged and of<br>
course, any immortal found cheating will be deleted and their mortal<br>
likely banned for a period, if not forever.<br>
<br>
In return, you have the opportunity to see your work and creations come to<br>
life and entertain the masses.  You will aid in Legacy's Dawning's course<br>
and design.  You will be not only a creator of the realm but also its<br>
protector.<br>
