The removal of a curse from an item is possible once clerics learn a fair<br>
amount about curses and their removal.  There are rumors and stories of<br>
many fabled items becoming usable by people after much work being done by<br>
the clergy.  This particular spell will only work 'before' the item is<br>
worn.<br>
