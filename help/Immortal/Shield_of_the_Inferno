As the mage increases their mastery over fire they are able to imbue more<br>
heat into their spells whilst maintaining the safety of their target. <br>
This spell surrounds the target with a super heated bellowing blaze, it's<br>
flames licking out at opponents who touch it for significant damage.<br>
