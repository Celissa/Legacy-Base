Years ago, an aspiring wizard named Arinosh, determined his goal in life<br>
was to be a helping hand to the forces of nature...to create and change<br>
the way nature functioned without disruption of the balance that nature<br>
brought.  To this end, he sought the council of the elves, those beings<br>
most closely tied to the very earth itself.  His character spoke true and<br>
so the mage dwelt among the elves for some years, learning from them and<br>
watching their peaceful coexistence with land.  Alas, Arinosh left the<br>
elves, and traveled out into the wilds to carve out a home for himself. <br>
Scouring the countryside, he found a suitable spot and set to work<br>
crafting a domain.<br>
<br>
             ******************************************<br>
<br>
Arinosh settled in the hills near the ogre town of Denab-Knur, where he<br>
began creating a garden paradise.  Thieves and brigands raided the<br>
location often at first, but then Arinosh developed some mysterious<br>
manner of defense and the vagabonds withdrew to leave the hedge wizard to<br>
his own devises.  Unfortunately, the peace was short-lived.  Recent<br>
messages received by Prenslie of Chiiron and Krasnog of Medienne tell of<br>
a desperate situation forming at the hedge garden.  Arinosh has detected<br>
a sinister presence infiltrating his plant creations and has asked for<br>
help from his fellow mages and their champions.<br>
