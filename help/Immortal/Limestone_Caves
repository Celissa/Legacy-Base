Eons of water flow have changed much of the tar caverns, eating out rooms<br>
and churning away tunnels until the maze of rock stretches far into the<br>
underdark.  Where pockets of limestone rock intermingle with the hard<br>
black volcanic stones the effects of the water are much more dramatic,<br>
churning the soft rock into stone sculptures and twisted pillars.  Some<br>
underground creatures find the wet conditions ideal for their particular<br>
habitual needs, making the caves a tad more dangerous than the well<br>
trodden path.<br>
