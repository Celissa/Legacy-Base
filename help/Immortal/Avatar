An AVATAR is a mortal designated to approve players.  The reason for<br>
their existence is to reduce the workload on the immortals and to have<br>
people that newbies can turn to when confused.  Clan leaders will not be<br>
considered for becoming avatars as selecting them could be seen as<br>
showing bias to their clan.<br>
<br>
Avatars may also help players construct an acceptable appearance,<br>
keywords and description.  However, all players are urged to read the<br>
helps, beginning with HELP APPROVAL.<br>
<br>
Avatars should not approve anyone who is a friend or whom the avatar is<br>
otherwise emotionally connected to.  So do not ask your pal to approve<br>
you.  Ask another avatar or an immortal.<br>
<br>
Applications for avatarhood should be mudmailed to Azerin, and<br>
should contain the following: <br>
<br>
A sample description of one dark and one light race character and<br>
appearances for those descriptions.<br>
<br>
Applications will be considered for English, creativity, and conformance<br>
to the approval rules.  Those who meet the criteria will be promoted<br>
whenever there is a need for more avatars.<br>
