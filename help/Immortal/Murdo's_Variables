/Murdo/portal/open ....  set on room 52671.  1 is open, 0 is closed. <br>
Portal rooms are 52671 and 2305.<br>
<br>
/Murdo/CaveYeti/Position ... 1-7, marks position in grid.<br>
/Murdo/CaveYeti/Front ... 1 means front row, 0 means back...<br>
These variables are not part of a fuctioning code as of yet...  it's an<br>
experiment (interrupted..  ongoing?) in giving players more options<br>
during combat..  chars can move around inside the room to various<br>
positions to try to out-strategize the cave yeti...  the implication<br>
being that those who simply stand and swing will take the full blunt of<br>
the damage.<br>
