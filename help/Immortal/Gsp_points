Gossip points are a method to limit the amount a player uses the global<br>
channels.  The desire for this is due to some players having a tendency<br>
to be rather loquacious if not somehow muffled.  A player begins the game<br>
with a small amount which slowly increases to a maximum of 1000 with time.<br>
Using chat or OOC costs 1 gossip point, gossip requires 10 and shout<br>
requires 500.  Minor swearing invokes a penalty of 50 gossip points.  The<br>
number of gossip points your character has is displayed on score.<br>
