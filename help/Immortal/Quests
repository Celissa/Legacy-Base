<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The land of Legacy's Dawning is filled with intelligent people of<br>
all sorts..  and not so intelligent ones.  Many of these people (NPCs)<br>
are in need of aid for one situation or another.  Others have wondrous<br>
items to pass on to the deserving but wish to test your worthiness to<br>
receive such a treasure.  Still others have the most important of all<br>
gifts to pass on, the gift of knowledge for those that follow in their<br>
footsteps.  Many of these 'quests' are received merely by telling a<br>
particular character 'hello' ( to [mob] hi) but some require 'asking'<br>
about a specific item, skill, spell or person to assign their task. <br>
Completing the assigned 'quest' results in quest points and/or knowledge<br>
of a trainer or skill.  Almost anyone can have a quest, so be inquisitive<br>
and question every NPC you come across.<br>
