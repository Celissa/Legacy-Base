METALS OF THE REALM<br>
  <br>
Copper<br>
A soft, abundant, easily mined metal, copper is cheapest coin of the<br>
realm.<br>
  <br>
Silver<br>
Soft and gleaming, silver is rarer and more valuable than copper.  One<br>
piece of silver is worth ten pieces of copper.<br>
 <br>
Gold<br>
Most of the gold of the realm comes from the mines of the industrious<br>
Dwarves of Kha-Da.  Gold is a rare, extremely heavy metal.  One piece of<br>
gold equal ten pieces of silver.<br>
 <br>
Platinum<br>
Earlier finders of platinum condemned it as "false silver" and threw it<br>
into the ocean.  They came to learn the value of the hard, light metal,<br>
however.  Platinum is silver-white, is very rare, and quite expensive. <br>
One platinum piece equals ten pieces of gold.  While almost everlasting,<br>
it is too soft and expensive to use in most armor.<br>
  <br>
Bronze<br>
Soft, malleable, and plentiful, bronze was the first metal used by<br>
mortals for making weapons and armor.  The practice of using bronze has<br>
not gone out of style, however, because bronze is inexpensive and easily<br>
replaceable.  Bronze is usually impure, thus bronze weapons and armor are<br>
inordinately heavy.  Also, because the metal is so soft, it tends to<br>
blunt easily.  Bronze tends to be easy to enchant.<br>
  <br>
Iron<br>
A heavy, hard metal, iron is the most prominent material used in weapon<br>
making.  It can be forged by even apprentice blacksmiths, and is abundant<br>
enough to be relatively cheap.  Found deep in the earth, iron tends to be<br>
impure, and is therefore heavy.  It does not blunt readily as bronze,<br>
however, so consqeuently is ideal for armor and edged weapons.  Iron is<br>
fairly easy to enchant.<br>
  <br>
Steel<br>
Steel is iron which has been super-heated to boil out impurities. <br>
Extremely hard, steel is surprisingly light-weight.  Steel weapons will<br>
keep their edges, and steel armor will not dent easily.  Because only<br>
experienced blacksmiths can work with steel, it is quite expensive.  The<br>
Dwarves generally claim to have discovered steel, as only their mighty<br>
forges could have produced enough heat to draw steel from iron.  Steel is<br>
very disruptive to mage spells, and it tends to resist enchantment.<br>
  <br>
Electrum<br>
A rare alloy consisting of gold, silver and copper, electrum is<br>
silver-gold in color, is lighter than gold, and is quite soft. <br>
Therefore, it tends not to last when forged into weapons and armor. <br>
However, ancient mages discovered that electrum is extremely receptive to<br>
magic, so much so that it does not hinder a mage's spell-casting ability.<br>
  <br>
Mithril<br>
The process of creating mithril is one of the most guarded secrets of the<br>
elves, whose ancients were said to have worn suits of enchanted mithril<br>
chainmail.  However, though no outsiders know how to create mithril, many<br>
know how to forge it.  Several master blacksmiths claim to have learned<br>
the secret of shaping the incredibly hard, lighweight metal.  Mithril is<br>
a bright, almost white, glimmering silver color.  Among metals, it is<br>
second only to liridium in hardness.  Unlike liridium, however,<br>
mithril is easier to enchant, although it does hinder a mage's spell<br>
casting ability.<br>
  <br>
Krynite<br>
Rumors abound concerning the origins of the strange, dark purple metal. <br>
The most popular of these rumors is that the metal came from an ancient<br>
race of godlings, whose weapons of krynite sank into the ground of the<br>
battlefield where they destroyed themselves in a terrifying war.<br>
Whatever its origins, krynite is undoubtedly magical in nature.  All<br>
krynite exudes a soft, pallid glow, which fades as the metal gets<br>
fatigued.  However, because every pore of the metal is infused with<br>
magic, it will always resist infusions of further energy, such as<br>
enchantment.  Krynite will not interfere with a mage's spell casting<br>
ability.  The metal is incredibly expensive, and so difficult to work<br>
with that only a genius could ever hope to forge it.<br>
  <br>
Titanium<br>
A rare metal found occasionally in the deepest of mines, titanium is dark<br>
gray in color, almost silvery due to its luster.  It is very hard,<br>
extremely light and resists corrosion.  The dwarves, who are rumored to<br>
be the first to have encountered this metal, value it highly and have<br>
perfected methods to temper and shape it.  However, only the best of<br>
armorsmiths and weaponsmiths are able to tame it into a useable form. <br>
Small amounts of titanium occasionally finds its way into jewelry, as the<br>
metal seems to have the quality of nullifying magic, being vary stable in<br>
form and extremely resistant to change.<br>
<br>
Liridium<br>
Almost nothing is known about this rare, dull-gray metal.  It is said<br>
that those who discovered and could forge the metal have all died. <br>
Another rumor holds that liridium is so hard that it can be forged only<br>
with the combination of a giant's strength and archmage's magic. <br>
Liridium is second only to diamond in hardness.  A warrior's metal,<br>
liridium makes incalculably valuable weapons and armor.  It is<br>
extremely difficult to enchant, and is, for mages, the most disruptive<br>
material known.<br>
