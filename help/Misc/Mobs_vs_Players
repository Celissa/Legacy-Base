Far too often we see notes on the bugs, general, and ideas board asking<br>
why mob skills that mimic player skills are better than player skills, or<br>
even demanding that the mobs be better balanced as they have better<br>
skills than the players.<br>
   <br>
This extends to things such as...  My level 10 warrior can only have 2<br>
attacks, so why can the mob I'm obviously better than have 3 attacks? <br>
...Why can this mage I'm fighting cast a fireball every round yet it take<br>
me several rounds?  ...How can this mob cast lightning bolts at me and<br>
manage to claw me twice at the same time?  ...How can this mob is using a<br>
sword like a fighter, spin kicking me like a monk, and casting a fireball<br>
at me like a mage?<br>
   <br>
Trust me, the mobs ARE balanced to the players.<br>
     <br>
The experience on a mob is automatically determined by several factors,<br>
which include how much damage the mob generally does and how long it<br>
lives.  This leaves only a few options open to us to keep the mobs of Legacy's Dawning<br>
interesting to the players.<br>
- Either we give every mob you come across the same types of armor the<br>
players have, meaning almost everything would have a hodgepodge of +1,<br>
and +2 armor with every slot filled with something.  This would greatly<br>
devalue the cost of equipment and one of the things that we strive for is<br>
to have value placed on valuable equipment, so this is not an option.<br>
- Or we modify their attacks.  Even here a balance must be struck.<br>
  <br>
Since there must be higher lever, more powerful mobs for the more<br>
experienced players to fight they must be able to do enough damage to<br>
provide a threat to people wearing the kind of armor and defensive spells<br>
our high level players use.  To this end Legacy's Dawning has a set of standards to<br>
which the builders adhere when creating mobs.  When a mob is assigned its<br>
level, the standards determine how much life the mob has as well as how<br>
much damage it must have the capacity to deal.  To preserve the value of<br>
equipment, and insure everyone isn't pulling Flaming Mithril Swords of<br>
Death +3 off of the kobolds, this means we modify them and give them<br>
special attacks.  Sometimes this means we will give them a few extra<br>
attacks in the round with mundane weapons, or modify the damage so they<br>
tend to be doing more damage with a mundane weapon then it normally deals. <br>
For all you know, they are just better trained to use it.<br>
  <br>
Spells...  Not every spell you see a mob cast is exactly what the players<br>
have.  The damaging effects of spells are also a part of the damage<br>
covered under our standards.  If a mob is able to cast a fireball every<br>
round, faster than you, it is only doing the damage it is supposed to and<br>
its experience reward will reflect that.  Perhaps they just cast it<br>
differently and had a better teacher or perhaps they have a better inate<br>
ability to focus magic.  Deal with it.<br>
  <br>
We do try to keep them sensible, but we can not apply the same rules to<br>
the mobs that apply to the players.  Otherwise there would probably only<br>
be a handful of mobs on the mud yielding over 5000 experience.  Even if<br>
that seems like a lot to you now, it won't later.  Later on, when you<br>
need a million exp, or even just a few hundred thousand, and you need to<br>
be killing mobs that yield 10,000 or more exp at a time having mobs whose<br>
skills and equipment are the same as players that yield only a 5000 exp<br>
tops will seem quite boring.  How fun do you think it'd be to kill a<br>
million rabbits over several hours and still not level?  So bear with us,<br>
play, have fun...  But most of all enjoy it.<br>
