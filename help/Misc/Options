<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>

<h1> Description </h1>
The 'options' command will allow you to view and configure the options<br>
which control your interface and affect your environment.<br>
<br>
By typing 'options' with no arguments, you will see the options you<br>
currently have set.<br>
<br>
By typing 'options' followed by one of the available keywords, you<br>
will toggle the stated option.<br>
<br>
example : opt no_summon will toggle that option on or off.<br>
You will see a message stating : "No_summon set to TRUE" (or FALSE, as<br>
the case may be).  If the message were, "No_summon set to TRUE," then you<br>
cannot be summoned.<br>
<br>
Note that the '*' after the flag indicates that the option is 'on'; eg,<br>
no_summon (*) indicates that you cannot be summoned.<br>
<br>
Options under 'Option Levels' can be set from 0 to 3 by typing option<br>
[option] [#], and the number is shown in parentheses.  Setting an option<br>
level at 0 will turn off the level-settable option and be indicated with<br>
a hyphen with the parentheses.<br>
