<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
One may buy pets in pet shops, which are located in various towns.  Only<br>
two pets are allowed at the same time, which explains the need for the<br>
abandon option.<br>
<br>
NOTE: When naming your pet, do not use numbers or anything other than<br>
letters and don't name it anything even remotely resembling your name.It<br>
can cause all sorts of problems.<br>
 <br>
NOTE: Be very careful when using the abandon command.  Abandoning<br>
aggressive pets in areas where they aren't normally found, is highly<br>
frowned upon by the staff, especially if that area is a place frequented<br>
by newbies.<br>
