As a player, you are responsible for your own actions and your own<br>
account.  If you give your password out or share your account with<br>
someone else and they cuase trouble and get your account banned, then it<br>
is as much your fault as theirs.  You will be held just as accountable as<br>
they are.<br>
   <br>
You are responsible for following the policies.<br>
  <br>
You are also responsible for keeping up with the changes of the mud. <br>
Look before you leap.  All major/important changes are posted on either<br>
the motd, which you see on log in or can read through help, or on the<br>
announcements noteboard.<br>
  <br>
If you charge into combat, only to find some command vital to your<br>
success has changed, odds are it was posted and there will be no<br>
reimbursements of death for it.  The exception to this rule is mobs. <br>
Sometimes (rarely) a mob may change a little.  If it is found that a mob<br>
is extremely susceptable to some new skill, they may be granted something<br>
to compensate.  It is always a good idea to consider a mob before<br>
attacking it.  Look before you leap.<br>
