Your "saving throws", or resistances, are listed when you use the<br>
score command.  They are displayed as a percentage value, with 0%<br>
being the hypothetical "average" human's resistance versus a particular<br>
element.  Negative values imply an increased susceptiblity to that type<br>
of damage, while a positive number indicates that you will take that<br>
percent less damage.<br>
