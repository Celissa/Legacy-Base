<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Using the skin command, you may get items such as: skins, furs, meat, and<br>
other body parts from the corpse of a mob.  This, however, does *not* mean<br>
that all mobs will produce items when skinned.  Using skin, you can<br>
retrieve any useful items from the corpse of a creature.  This is most<br>
useful on creatures with fur, such as rabbits, foxes, and deer.<br>
