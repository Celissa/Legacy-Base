<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
quit : saves your position and ends your session<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Use this command when you are finished playing.  It will save all of your<br>
items, pets, location, and mail.  (There is no rent at the Forest's<br>
Heart).  You may quit virtually anywhere, with a few exceptions (such as<br>
being unable to quit in a town where you are wanted by the clan in<br>
control, or during combat).<br>
<br>
Be careful where you quit; you might come back later to find an<br>
aggressive mob waiting for you if you choose to end your session in an<br>
unsafe location.<br>
