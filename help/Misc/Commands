commands                      : lists all command categories<br>
commands [category]           : lists all commands in the category<br>
commands -p [permission_flag] : lists commands requiring that flag<br>

<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
This displays all commands divided by logical category or by permission<br>
flag.  Most players only have the none permission flag so the second<br>
option is irrelevant to most.  You can also type Help [letter] to see<br>
help files starting with a particular letter of the alphabet.  Ex: Help A.<br>
