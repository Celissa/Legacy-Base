<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The banking system provides a convenient mechanism for storing and<br>
retrieving money.  The bank performs all transactions in units of copper<br>
pieces, and returns to you the correct distribution between all coin<br>
types.  <br>
<br>
Your money in the bank is not insured.  While there is currently no<br>
mechanism in place to rob a bank, there will likely be a way in the<br>
future. Additionally, the bank does not provide interest to its account<br>
holders.  <br>
