Legacy's Dawning has no class guilds per se.  Instead any mob can<br>
be a teacher of any skill.  Lower level skills are taught in starting<br>
towns or nearby by shopkeepers and a few dedicated trainers.  Most of the<br>
higher level skills have to be quested for.  To see if any mob in the<br>
room can teach any skills to you type [prac]tice.  If there is a<br>
trainer in the room you will be told there is nothing they can teach you<br>
or will be given a list of what they can teach you and how much<br>
everything costs.<br>

Legacy's Dawning has player-run guilds, they operate in a similar way to<br>
a clan but operate toward a more financial gain.  See 'help clans' for<br>
more information.<br>
