This may seem like a strange catagory to have on a mud, but in dealing with<br>
immortals Legacy's Dawning has some standard policies of what is allowable.<br>
Realize that the immortals on the mud are donating their time and effort to<br>
improve this mud.  And with the number of complaints, requests for help<br>
that any immortal gets it is difficult not to become abrupt and ignore many<br>
of them.<br>
<br>
* You should always know which immortal you are dealing with.  An immortal<br>
should not punish someone without going visible for at least a brief<br>
instance.<br>
<br>
* Immortals should not switch to mobs in an attempt to kill a player or<br>
harass them.  Switching to a mob to amuse/confuse a mortal is fine, but<br>
should be done in the spirit of fun.  If a player has found a bug to kill a<br>
mob which they should not be able to kill, switching to the mob and killing<br>
the player is not an acceptable solution.  Asking the player to stay away<br>
from the mob and then fixing it is recommended.<br>
