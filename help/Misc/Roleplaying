Role Playing<br>
---- -------<br>
<br>
Role playing(RP) is when you act like your character you are<br>
playing.  For example, if you play a troll warrior you act like a dumb<br>
troll, you talk like one, fight like one, and do everything like one.  Or<br>
if you are a rich noble you act like a snobby rich bastard, if you are<br>
one.  RPing makes the game take on a whole new dimension you are no<br>
longer just hacking and slashing you are truely living the game and it's<br>
far more enjoyable than just hack'n slash.<br>
<br>
To RP though you need to have a background for your character and a<br>
detailed DESCRIPTION.  This will allow you to play a consistant<br>
character and not confuse everyone.  Its a little tough in the beginning<br>
as you round off the ruff edges, but once you get it going, you'll love<br>
it.  Also, keep in mind, there is a difference between being a jerk, and<br>
playing an evil character.  <br>
<br>
So ROLE PLAY!!<br>
