<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
auction                  : lists items for sale<br>

<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Auction places an item on the auction block from anywhere throughout<br>
the land.  When an item is placed on the block, a timer is started. <br>
Players may bid on an item using the bid command.  To place a bid you<br>
must have sufficent funds in your bank account.  At the end of the time<br>
whoever has placed the highest bid receives the item.  If no one has bid<br>
on the item it is returned to the seller.  If either seller or buyer has<br>
quit the game the transaction still occurs with the player file being<br>
modified as appropriate.  Gold is only transfered between bank accounts<br>
so if an item is sold the seller's bank account will be credited with the<br>
bid price and the buyer's debited.  The auction undo command removes<br>
an item from the block assuming it is issued shortly after the item is<br>
auctioned.<br>
<br>
The auction gremlin charges a small fee for his services.<br>
