In order to gain in proficiency in a skill, one must be trained in that<br>
skill by the appropriate teacher.  Trainers for higher level skills,<br>
generally anything above 15th level, are often found in out of the way<br>
locations, and will usually require some exploration and thought to find<br>
them.  Don't be afraid to ask NPCs(non-player characters) about skills you<br>
want to learn.  Please note that a teacher for a particular skill of one<br>
class may not teach that same skill to another class and that one can be<br>
trained in a skill only up to level 7.  Further increases in skill level<br>
will depend upon successful use and your character's intelligence and<br>
wisdom.<br>
