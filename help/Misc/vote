vote [poll] [category]<br>
<br>
WHAT ITS ABOUT<br>
<br>
Occasionally, a change will be such that we (the immortals) can't decide<br>
a proper direction to take, so the vote system was implemented.  Your<br>
votes may very well affect the course the mud takes.<br>
<br>
Examples<br>
<br>
vote (with no arguments brings up a list of polls, their results, and<br>
whether they are still open or not.<br>
<br>
vote [pollname] (no category argument) brings up the list of categories<br>
you can vote for <br>
<br>
vote [pollname] [category] will register your vote, you only get one vote<br>
per poll.<br>
<br>
So take the poll Shield.Spells for example.<br>
vote Shield.Spells will bring up a list of these categories and how to do<br>
it.<br>
<br>
It will list these options:<br>
Allow.Similar.but.No.Opposites<br>
No.Similar.or.Opposites<br>
Allow.Only.One.Shield.at.Time<br>
<br>
So say you want to vote for the one.shield.at.time option<br>
You would input:<br>
<br>
vote shield.spells Allow.Only.One.Shield.at.Time<br>
