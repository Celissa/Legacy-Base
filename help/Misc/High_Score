<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The high score list allows you to compare your level of experience with<br>
other players.  The command displays two columns of lists.  On the left,<br>
the top ten characters in the entire mud will be listed, while the right<br>
column displays your current position and the players nearest your level<br>
of experience.<br>
<br>
Entering "high #" will have the list start at that number.  It will<br>
display that number and the next 19 characters in order of experience.<br>
<br>
Any players who have the incognito option set appear as ???  in the<br>
lists, thereby preserving their anonymity.<br>
