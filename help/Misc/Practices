Practice Points:<br>
Practice points may be gained according to the following criteria:<br>
<br>
as "bonus" practices, gained while leveling;<br>
or when a skill is used successfully;<br>
they are not determined by XP gain;<br>
every so often, one has a chance to gain a prac if he or she uses a<br>
   skill successfully;<br>
one's chance to gain practice points is modified by INT and WIS.<br>
<br>
INT and WIS also affect the maximum number of pracs which your character<br>
may possess at any one time.  ("The Grey Matter Quotient", also affected<br>
by level.) <br>
<br>
For example:<br>
Bob "Genghis" Khan goes about fighting critters, in his battles he uses<br>
skills he already knows.  Bob "Genghis" Khan then gains a practices point<br>
because he is using his skills and has a high wis and intelligence.  Then<br>
after a while again he gets another, becuase his situation met the above<br>
criteria.  Bob "Genghis" Khan can then use those practices once he has<br>
found a teacher and practice any skill which is available.<br>
