<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
 It is often simplest to write your message one sentence at a time etc.. <br>
This is so that you can insert lines of text between what you have<br>
already written (use even line numbers for this) and format it<br>
afterwards, using [subj] #-#, which will make your sentences into<br>
organized paragraphs.<br>
<br>
!NOTE!<br>
<br>
 [subj] is any one of the following: note, mail, or desc.  There are<br>
some editor functions that only work for a specific subject, so make sure<br>
to read the help on note, mail, and desc before going much<br>
further, if you haven't already.<br>
<br>
Example :<br>
Typing "Desc 1 This is a test" would add "This is a test" as the first<br>
line of your description.<br>
