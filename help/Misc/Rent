There is no rent at Legacy's Dawning.<br>
<br>
You do not need to go to an inn to quit, or to continue playing to earn<br>
money so you may safely rent.  Instead, merely use the Quit command. <br>
You may quit wherever you may wish, with a few restrictions (ie not while<br>
during fighting, or in a town where you are wanted), and when you do so<br>
your position is saved.  Any pets which you may have are saved where they<br>
may be, your items, whether carried by you, in the bank, or on your pets,<br>
are also saved, and all of your mail is likewise kept.<br>
<br>
A word of caution - consider well where you quit.  A wandering aggressive<br>
mob might be waiting for you when you return if you choose a dangerous<br>
spot.  Towns are popular places to quit, and are usually safe.<br>
