<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
So to set your terminal to ansi type 'color ansi' then to make room names<br>
appear in bold type 'color room_name bold'.  To have a status bar type<br>
'option status'.  Note though for any of the colors to work you need to<br>
have your term_type set to something other than dumb.  The possible<br>
formats for the various groups are listed by typing just 'color'.<br>
The colors such as red/green/yellow only work in ansi mode as vt100 does<br>
not support these colors.  <br>
