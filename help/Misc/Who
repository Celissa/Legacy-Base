<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
The who list will list all players who are visible and online.  Each player<br>
is placed in a category according to how well you know them.  The first<br>
category is self-explanatory: Immortal.  The befriended category will list<br>
all people who are on that are befriended to you.  The known category lists<br>
people who you are introduced to but not befriended.  The unknown category<br>
lists people who you have not been introduced to.  Each player can only<br>
appear once on the who list, so someone who is befriended will not appear<br>
in the known category.<br>
