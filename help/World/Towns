This is a current list of towns, their current status, and which race<br>
dwells in each.  This list is under construction constantly so be aware<br>
things do move.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Chiiron]<br>
[Humans: Secomber]<br>
<br>
The city of Chiiron lies a few miles west of the Sea of Stars.  This city<br>
is the primary home of the humans in this region of the realms.  Although<br>
it started out as a trading post, Chiiron quickly grew to be a thriving<br>
community and welcomes all light races.  Chiiron is also the starting point<br>
for many new and brave adventurers.<br>
<br>
WARNING: Chiiron does not tolerate those of evil intent.<br>
<br>
[Medienne]<br>
[Humans: Secomber]<br>
<br>
Medienne was once a thriving merchant community until a long and deadly war<br>
with the neighboring elves ravaged the city.  The city has slowly begun to<br>
rebuild itself to its former glory but is also in constant danger due to<br>
the nearby forest and graveyard filled with many dangerous creatures, both<br>
living and undead.  Despite its hazardous locale, many adventurers call<br>
Medienne home due to its tolerance for both light and dark races.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Medienne is tolerant of all law-abiding citizens.<br>
<br>
[Darkhaven]<br>
[Dark Races of evil alignment]<br>
<br>
Darkhaven is the small underground city that serves as a home to the most<br>
evil characters of the realms.  Many humans, vyans, ogres, trolls and the<br>
like call this city home due to its hidden location.  No light race has<br>
ever ventured into the city and returned to tell what lies beyond its<br>
closely guarded gates.<br>
<br>
WARNING: Darkhaven is tolerant only to those of evil intent.<br>
<br>
[Pennan]<br>
[Humans: Secomber]<br>
<br>
Pennan is a sprawling farming community a few miles west of Chiiron.<br>
Surrounding the city, lush green hills serve as grazing grounds for the<br>
local farmers' herds.  Pennan is under constant threat of attack by an<br>
active band of renegade gnomes and marauding hobgoblins that lie<br>
dangerously close to the village's outskirts.  Pennan is known for their<br>
superior armorsmiths which have setup shops and make finely crafted armors.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Pennan is tolerant of all law-abiding citizens.<br>
<br>
[Kha-Da]<br>
[Dwarves: Khedrun]<br>
<br>
Nestled deep inside the Cairn Mountains lies the dwarven stronghold known<br>
as Kha-Da.  The city is home to superior dwarven armorsmiths and<br>
weaponsmiths.  A few dwarves call this city home as is it so isolated that<br>
it rarely has any trouble from the nearby monsters.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Kha-da is tolerant of all law-abiding citizens.<br>
<br>
[Brithbarad]<br>
[Orcs: Azak]<br>
<br>
Brithbarad is a large orcish outpost several miles north of the Black<br>
Hills.  The outpost is surrounded by grassy plain regions, home to several<br>
varieties of dangerous animals.  Many dark races, in addition to orcs, call<br>
this city home, due to the tolerance the orcs have for other races which<br>
someday may be needed as allies.<br>
<br>
WARNING: Brithbarad is tolerant only of dark race people.<br>
<br>
[Denab-Knur]<br>
[Ogres: Karse]<br>
<br>
Located in the side of the Dragonspire Mountains, this ruined town was once<br>
a thriving human settlement.  After several brutal battles, the ogres of<br>
the land slaughtered all the townsfolk and claimed it as their own.  Since<br>
then, it has grown steadily more decrepit and ruined.  The main home for<br>
ogres, the town also holds a tolerance for other dark races.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Denab-Knur is tolerant of all law abiding people.<br>
<br>
[Vaasa]<br>
[Elves: Eleint]<br>
<br>
Little is known about this elven city for only a selected few of<br>
non-elven heritage have ventured into it.  Those that have seen it have<br>
come back to tell about its beautiful view overlooking the Vaasa and its<br>
marvelous construction.  Hidden among the trees, only elves seem to be<br>
able to find its extremely well hidden locale.  WARNING: Rumors<br>
persist that the vaasan elves hold little welcome to those of non-elven<br>
heritage unless they are accompanied by an elf, are an ent or have joined<br>
the Shuvana Guard.  Whispers speak of jails and dank pits well on the<br>
edge of elven influence.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sos-Kul]<br>
[Lizardmen: Stahl]<br>
<br>
Most would call the Kss'sk swamp a dark, dank place where only fierce<br>
beasts and giant leeches dwell, but to the lizardmen, the swamp is known as<br>
home.  Nestled within the swamp is the lizardman city of Sos-Kul.  Although<br>
not as advanced as other races, the lizardmen pride themselves upon being<br>
able to live in such an unforgiving enviroment.  The city lies far to the<br>
south and the path is dangerous to all but the most experienced adventurer.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Sos-kul is tolerant of all law-abiding citizens.<br>
<br>
[Voaleth]<br>
[Vyan: Dvyie]<br>
<br>
Located off The Great North Road between Denab-Kur and Medienne, Voaleth<br>
can only be reached by a series of long tunnels that lead deep<br>
underground to the city gates.  Home primarily of the vyans, ogres and<br>
trolls serve them well by guarding the city from the intrusion of the<br>
hated light races.  The city, itself, faces few threats from outsiders. <br>
Whether this is due to its location or the inhospitable location no one<br>
has ever determined.<br>
<br>
Warning: Voaleth is tolerant only of dark races and light races of<br>
neutral alignement.<br>
<br>
[Dulthor's Hold]<br>
[All races are welcome]<br>
<br>
This small fishing village is located on the seaward side of the Cairn<br>
Mountains, far to the north of Kha-da.  The hamlet welcomes all people of<br>
all races...those that are hardy or brave enough to venture the dangers<br>
of the road.  A dwarven armorsmith and serveral other craftsmen of no<br>
mean skill have made their homes along the frigid shores of the Moonfall<br>
Sea.<br>
