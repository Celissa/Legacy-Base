[Abhanthorp]<br>
[Halfling - All races welcome]<br>
<br>
Deep in a valley lying far to the north and west of Chiiron, lies the<br>
diminutive halfling village of Abhanthorp.  Little is known of its<br>
history since it was only recently rediscovered by the outside world. <br>
The townsfolk are friendly and welcoming to all who wander there, but<br>
there are rumors that the local scouts are fiercely protective of the<br>
small population and the peoples' memories are long.<br>
<br>
[Warning:] - The protectors of this the town do not forget those that<br>
dare to attack the town or its citizens.<br>
