Although the different races keep track of history and the passage of<br>
time in different ways, a common calendar has arisen throughout the realm<br>
to aid sailors, traders and merchants, the churches...and a number of<br>
other multi-racial social elements and institutions.  The year is based<br>
on eight months. The first six months have forty days each, and the<br>
winter months, Searg and Dorchva have 39 and 38, respectively.  The year<br>
starts in the spring.<br>

Month 4 - Na'Suan<br>

Month 7 - Searg<br>
Month 8 - Dorchva<br>
