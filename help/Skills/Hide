You have to actively try to hide.  If you succeed, you will remain hidden<br>
from normal visual senses.  Even if you leave the room, people will only be<br>
able to hear you leave. You need to type it again to stop doing it.<br>
<br>
Alot of commands will disrupt your hiding attempts, and you will need to<br>
rehide yourself.  Sometimes you will think you are hidden and are not, as<br>
far as you are concerned you managed to hide from normal senses, but you<br>
don't always do it successfully.<br>
