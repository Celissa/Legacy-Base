This skill allows you the possibility to attack twice per round.  Most<br>
classes can attain this level of combat skill.<br>
<br>
This skill is automatic, but note that learning second attack even to<br>
level 10 does not mean you will have two attacks all the time, every<br>
round.  It merely gives you a higher chance of getting in an extra attack.<br>
