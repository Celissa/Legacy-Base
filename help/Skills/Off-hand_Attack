This skill allows players to wield a weapon in each hand.  Doing so<br>
eliminates the possibility of using a shield or a two-handed weapon, but<br>
given an intelligent choice of weapons it should increase the damage a<br>
warrior can do.  Only dagger type weapons can be wielded in the off-hand,<br>
as two swords, for example, would be completely unmanageable.<br>
<br>
The command to use a secondary weapon is : hold [dagger_name]<br>
<br>
A second off-handed attack is planned to be implemented soon exclusively<br>
for warriors.<br>
