The tool of the master thief, the assassinate skill inflicts terrible<br>
damage upon an unsuspecting victim.  It is more difficult to perform with<br>
success than its lesser sibling, backstab, and demands, like<br>
backstab, that the thief be proficient in hiding and sneaking.  Noisy<br>
items, metal armor, or a burdened status will also negatively affect<br>
success rates.<br>
<br>
More skills of this variety are planned.<br>
