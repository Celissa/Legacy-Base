Tiger paw is a monk skill allowing them to do significantly more damage<br>
with their bare hands.  At high levels a monk will be able to do much<br>
more damage with their hands than with a weapon.  You do not need to type<br>
anything to use this skill; it will automatically 'kick in' when it<br>
succeeds during combat.<br>
