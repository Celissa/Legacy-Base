This skill allows monks to sense their opponent using more than just<br>
their sense of sight.  The result of this is that they are able to hit<br>
their opponents more accurately and with more power.  This skill is<br>
automatic, and is so ingrained in the monks repertoire they are not aware<br>
of it in action.<br>
