Swimming is a useful skill that all players should acquire at some point.<br>
It allows you to move underwater with a reasonable cost in movement points.<br>
Without it you flail uselessly getting nowhere and using all your movements<br>
points.  Since drowning is quite possible, some skill in swimming is<br>
necessary to enter any water region.  This skill is automatic.<br>
