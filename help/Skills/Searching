<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
When you are actively searching, you spend a few more points of movement,<br>
but you are more likely to find traps and secret doors.  NOTE: Finding a<br>
trap will only work if you are a Thief, or a Ranger.  And the ease of<br>
finding said trap is descending in that order.  So Thieves are the best<br>
at finding them.  They are also the ONLY class that gains the ability to<br>
try and disarm them.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Searching takes extra movement.  Please also see help file on<br>
options.  Also see help file: untrap.<br>
