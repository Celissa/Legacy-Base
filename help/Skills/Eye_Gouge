The most nimble and dexterous of thieves, after years of experience<br>
stabbing their opponents, have perfected their aim, and are able to gouge<br>
out their foe's eyes, rendering them blind for the duration of their<br>
lives.  Of course, even the most practiced can miss, and will be punished<br>
for their clumsiness.  In order to perform this correctly, the thief need<br>
only type 'gouge' followed by the name of their foe.<br>
