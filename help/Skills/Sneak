SYNTAX:<br>
<br>
sneak :  toggles sneak on or off.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION:<br>
<br>
You toggle this skill off or on.  When on, you use up more movement<br>
points, but no one will notice you enter or leave a room.  Even mobs are<br>
susceptible to this.  This can help you get past aggresive monsters, and<br>
can sometimes help getting past guards that would normally keep others<br>
out.  Please see help file on options.<br>
