Shadow Dance is a monk skill allowing them to focus their mental energies<br>
during battle to become part of the shadow plane for a very brief<br>
instant avoiding damage from an attack.  The skill is not without dangers<br>
though as there are rumors of monks stepping too far and getting trapped<br>
in the shadow plane.  <br>
<br>
This skill is automatic; in other words, there is no need to type in any<br>
command.<br>
