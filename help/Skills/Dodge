This skill is very useful for nimble characters.  It allows you to dodge<br>
enemy blows.  The chance of success is dependant upon dex and your<br>
comparative level to your opponents.  <br>
<br>
This is a passive skill, in that there is no need to type in any command<br>
for an attempt at dodging.<br>
