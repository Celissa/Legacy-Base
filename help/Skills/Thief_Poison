People who deal in the black market often also deal in lethal items,<br>
particularly those you use to poison a weapon, food or drink with.  There<br>
are few with any skill in the craftmanship, but they are said to hold the<br>
secrets tightly amongst themselves.  If you can find someone willing to<br>
teach you in the crafting and application of poisons it can have many<br>
different affects, depending on what you use to make the poison with. <br>
<br>
There are many different types of poisons, all with different affects,<br>
although through much effort it has been determined that a person can<br>
only be affected by one type of poison at a time.<br>
