Thieves, always so interested in causing death instantaneously, have long<br>
tried perfecting the art of the garotte, the method wherein the thief<br>
uses a thin coil of wire (or other cord type object) and attempts to<br>
shut-off all oxygen to the person.  Rumor has it, if the thief is strong<br>
enough, and using the proper type of garotte, he will behead his victim.<br>
