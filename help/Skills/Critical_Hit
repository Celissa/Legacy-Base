Critical hit is a monk skill which allows them to precisely aim their<br>
blows to do great damage.  Each time a monk scores a successful hit with<br>
a body part he has a chance to score a critical hit.  If the monk<br>
succeeds, the damage done by the blow is significantly greater than<br>
normal.<br>
<br>
A critical hit only be done using an attack or weapon with which the monk<br>
has familiarity; in other words, a monk will never critical hit with a<br>
sword.  Note that this skill is automatic; there is no need to type in<br>
any command to attempt a critical hit.<br>
