SYNTAX:<br>
<br>
Spot<br>
<br>
Their years of experience in the wilderness allows the ranger to learn to<br>
notice oddities in their surroundings - a slight shift in the shadows is<br>
all that is needed for the older foresters to see things hidden from<br>
other's sight.<br>
<br>
Experienced thieves have acquired this skill as well, learning it instead<br>
with the dark shadows of the alleys and secreted doorways of the towns.<br>
