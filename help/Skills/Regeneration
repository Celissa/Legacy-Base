A paladin, after many years of laying hands to help those in need, may be<br>
able help the injured heal even faster after the battle is over. <br>
Regeneration is the name of this skill, one which can even help<br>
dismembered limbs to be reattached and gain their original functionality. <br>
***NOTE*** This skill is activated with the 'lay hands' command.<br>
