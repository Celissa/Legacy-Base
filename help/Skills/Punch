<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Punching is much like a brawling skill.  It increases the amount of<br>
damage that you inflict in unarmed combat with punching attacks.  This<br>
skill, however, does not increase the damage inflicted by monk special<br>
attacks.  Nevertheless, it is a very important skill for monks, as even<br>
the most powerful of monks will sometimes use this skill in combat.<br>
