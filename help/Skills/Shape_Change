Druids learn how to manipulate their own bodies, and how to change them<br>
into other forms.  Their ability to shift allows them to assume many<br>
different forms, allowing them fantastic abilities.  To return to their<br>
natural form, they must shift return.<br>
<br>
With even more experience a practiced druid can shift his form, even in<br>
the heat of battle, and their shifting in form increases in speed.<br>
