Warrriors, as they advance in the art of combat, learn their opponents<br>
are constantly broadcasting signals about their next move or their<br>
fighting style.  They learn how to read this body language to defeat a<br>
creature of any race.  Going into a berserk rage cancels the benefit of<br>
this skill.<br>
