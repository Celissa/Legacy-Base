As monks become more proficient in their ability to master their minds and<br>
their bodies, they slowly learn to focus their excess energy so that it can<br>
be shared with others.  This ability, called energize, increases another's<br>
energy while reducing their own.  The ratio is dependent upon their<br>
expertise at this skill.<br>
