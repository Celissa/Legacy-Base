<h1> Syntax </h1>
<br>
flee : attempts to make you flee from current battle<br>
flee [direction] : attempts to flee from battle in a specified direction<br>
<br>
<h1> Description </h1>
This command is very useful when you find that you are in a losing battle<br>
situation.  You lose some experience points for fleeing with amount loss<br>
dependent on how powerful and badly hurt the foe is.  However, the amount<br>
loss is usually minimal compared to the amount loss from death.  So<br>
sometimes it may be better to flee to live to fight another day, rather<br>
than be brave and die today.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This command is not fail proof, and you may sometimes not be able<br>
to flee due to lack of movement points, being bashed, bad luck, or<br>
whatever.<br>
