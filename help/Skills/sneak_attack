After years of skulking about in the shadows a thief learns to pick times<br>
in the hectic melee to strike a distracted foe.  Such blows deal<br>
considerable damage to the vitals of a target, often a few well place<br>
knifes can end a fight quicker than a straight toe to toe slugging. <br>
Because a roguish fighter needs the attention of a victim diverted from<br>
them, it is not possible to sneak attack without having a helping friend<br>
or two engaging the target.<br>
