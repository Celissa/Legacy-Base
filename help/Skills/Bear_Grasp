A powerful throttling attack, bear grasp is a skill available<br>
exclusively to monks.  Upon a successful hit, a monk's grasp becomes as<br>
ironclad as the greatest of bears; the slightest tightening around a<br>
victim inflicts great damage through the monks' focusing of his or her<br>
inner will and advanced training.<br>
