<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
Craft with no argument will return a list of what possible potions you<br>
can create with your experience and skill level.  Some craftions will<br>
require a skill level higher than 10, so you will need to find some items<br>
to synergize your skill higher yet.<br>
<br>
Craft's arguments must match exactly one of the names revealed by craft<br>
with no argument.  This will either start the craftion process, or tell<br>
you what your missing.<br>
