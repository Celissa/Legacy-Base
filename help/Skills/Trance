<h1> Description </h1>
  <br>
Trance, a higher level of meditate, allows monks to relax their bodies,<br>
curing their wounds much more quickly than normal.  When a monk has<br>
mastered meditate, and reached his 25th level, trance can be learned to<br>
augment meditation.  It allows an even higher rate of regeneration when<br>
one meditates.<br>
