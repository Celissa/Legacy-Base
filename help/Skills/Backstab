<h1> Description </h1>
<br>
   A skill associated with thieves and thugs.  With their skills at<br>
sneaking and hiding, they get behind a target, and useing a piercing type<br>
weapon, stab it into very damaging parts of the body.  You don't actually<br>
have to try and sneak and hide to use the skill, but be aware it takes<br>
you a few moments to recover from the attack.  <br>
<br>
Damage depends on several factors - these include: level, dex, if victim<br>
can see you, and how noisy your armor is.  You have a very good chance to<br>
hit a sleeping or unconcious victim, but an alert victim who can see you<br>
is impossible to successfully backstab.<br>
