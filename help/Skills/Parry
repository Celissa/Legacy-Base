Parry is a skill which allows you to block some of an enemy's attacks. <br>
It is most effective with a sword or other long weapon, though daggers<br>
and other short weapons or fists can be effective to a lesser extent.<br>
<br>
This is a passive skill, in that there is no need to type in any command<br>
for an attempt at parry.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This skill is not the same thing as the "parry" option.  See help<br>
options for more information on the parry option.<br>
