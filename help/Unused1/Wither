Those well in tune with nature are able, at times, to call upon it to cause<br>
their mortal enemies to wither and die.  This high-level spell does two<br>
things simultaneously: it causes the target to lose some of their life<br>
force (constitution) as well as immediate damage due to the magical<br>
strength of the spell.<br>
