Inside a Squat Tower of Sand~
The interior of this short tower of sand is surprisingly sophisticated
for its decor is nothing what you might have expected in the desert.  The
tower is completely round on the inside and stands about forty feet tall. 
Spiraling around the resin-coated walls are shelves of sand which jut
directly out of the walls.  Upon the shelves are a variety of scrolls,
tomes, and objects, each of which looks anywhere from mildly old to
extremely ancient.  The floor of the tower has been tiled with small
squares of alternating red and black glass, upon which sits a chair,
table, and desk, all made out of sculpted sand.  On the east wall, just
under a particularly high bookshelf, hangs a worn and tattered tapestry
and to the south stands a door formed from bound reeds.

E
door bound reeds~
Thick, century-old reeds, bound together with strips of hide, form a door
which is set into the south wall.  Though crude, the door prevents the
elements for wandering in uninvited (as well as vagrants) and is lockable
from the inside, by way of a descending bar.
~
E
worn tattered tapestry 1 east~
Woven from bleached desert grass, the tapestry which hangs here is very
old and perhaps dates back to the founding of this small settlement. 
Most of the tapestry is too faded to make out, but from what you can see,
it appears that a deadly scene of conquest is taking place.  Hordes of
crab people are fleeing from the great pyramid while a bolt of lightning
strikes its tip.  At the edge of the tapestry, you notice that a bar
mechanism runs behind it and you realize that the tapestry is a concealed
door out to the east.
~
E
scrolls **M**~
Out of all the scrolls lining the shelves, very few, if any, appear
useful.  Most seem to be ancient and would probably crumble to dust at
the slightest touch.  Each scroll is carefully rolled up and bound with a
single ribbon of hide.
~
E
tomes **M**~
This modest library of books contains more volumes than many you have
seen previously.  Unfortunately, if the foreign scripts down their spines
are any indication, all of them are illegible.  The tomes vary in size,
color, and shape; from a round, palm-sized volume bound in blue, scaly
hide to a two-foot, green librum which is about as thick as your arm and
has been bound in the shape of a triangle.
~
E
objects **M**~
While the scrolls and tomes outnumber the objects on the shelves, the
objects themselves are nonetheless as interesting.  Placed at the
beginning and end of each shelf, probably as bookends, the objects vary
in type and oddity, from the skull of what you think must be a crabman,
to a stylized string instrument.
~
E
bookshelves shelves **M**~
The bookshelves which spiral up and around the tower are actually
extensions of the red, sandy walls themselves.  They jut straight out,
providing a flat surfaces for the books to rest upon.
~
E
floor tile squares black red **M**~
Small tiles of black and red glass stretch around the length of the floor. 
The pattern of colored-tiles alternates so that there is never two tiles
of the same color side by side.
~
E
chair~
A high-backed chair with an unusually wide seat sits behind the desk and
to the side of the large, sand-sculpted table, so that it might be used
for sitting at both.  Formed from resin-coated red and black sand, the
chair matches the alternating tiled floor perfectly.  The arms of the
chair bear deep scratch marks, as though they were the frequent victim of
someone's agitation.
~
E
table **M**~
Sculpted from black sand and coated with a clear, hardening resin, this
table stands about three feet high and lies adjacent to the desk in the
chamber.  The surface of the table is clear of everything, except for a
few pieces of old papyrus.
~
E
old papyrus **M**~
The papyrus on the desk appears to be some type of official document.  It
is written in a flowing script you would not have credited the crab
people with and bears some type of official seal down at the bottom.
~
E
desk **M**~
Sculpted from red sand and coated with hardening resin like every other
structure and piece of furniture you have seen thus far, this desk stands
in front of a large chair and adjacent to a large table.  The desk has
but a single drawer and its surface is clean of anything but a quill of
sorts, a few sheets of blank papyrus, and a bottle of what must be ink.
~
E
ink bottle **M**~
The bottle on the desk contains a thick, black fluid which looks harmless
and is probably what you think it is: ink.

Before a Squat Tower of Sand~
The red, sandy plains of the desert are fairly level here.  Except for a
series of unusual formations of sand to the east, this area looks as
though the sand has been artificially leveled.  Abruptly to the west, a
squat tower of sand ascends into the sky (at least for thirty or so feet). 
From the side of the tower hangs a mat of braided grasses.  The walls and
towers of red sandstone castles can be seen in nearly every direction.

At the Base of a Spiraling Column of Sand~
You stand along side one of the southernmost edges of the great canyon
which surrounds the entire Naraki desert.  The endless sands continue
outward, lapping at the base of the canyon walls like errant waves.  Out
of the center of these waves of sand, a single, columnar-dune rises,
twisting and spiraling upward like an alicorn.  A few loose pebbles rest
along the foot of the spiraling column of sand.  The battlements of two
identical castles built from red sandstone peek up over dunes of sand to
the southeast.

The loose pebbles which lie at the base of the spiraling dune of sand are

Twins in every respect, two castles built from red sandstone stand to the
near southwest.  You cannot see much more than their battlements from

Inside a Spiraling Tower of Sand~
The interior of the column of spiraling sand is actually part of a
slender tower which extends upwards, into the spire of the sandy pillar. 
The floor consists of hard, packed sand and the walls of the tower are
molded from black sand and coated with clear resins.  A simple mat of
woven grass lies on the floor and next to it there is a fat, tapered
candle and a pile of sand about five feet wide.  While there appears to
be at least a second story to this odd tower, there is no way of reaching
it.  In front of a door-shaped depression in the wall is a straight row
of pebbles.

Woven from alternating colors of green and brown, a medium-sized round
rug lies in the center of the room.  The alternating colors of grass have
been braided around a spiraling pattern that is half-hypnotic.
~
E
fat tapered candle~
Poured from melted animal fat, this odorous yellow candle is about a foot
thick at its base and stands more than four feet tall.  As it rises from
its iron cauldron holder, the candle twists and tapers to a fine point.
~
E
pile sand~
Beside the round, woven mat of grass rests a pile of sand.  The sand has
multiple depressions in it, as though something had been resting on it. 
Flakes of chitin lie on the surface of the sandy pile.
~
E
walls black~
Rather than being sculpted from red sand like most other structures here,
the walls of the spiral tower are lined with black sand and covered with
hardening resins.  The black sand is not indigenous to this region of
desert and hard toils must have been underwent to bring such a great
amount of it to this tower.
~
E

The floor of the tower consists of hard packed, red sand.  Except for the
pile of sand which lies next to the rug, the floor has been swept clean.

At the Top of the Tower~
As you gaze around in the upper part of the spiraling tower, the first
thing you notice is there floor.  There is not one!  Or at least, not a
visible one.  Like the illusions cast to protect the crabman village from
intrusion, it appears some magic has been cast on the floor, turning it
invisible.  A single table with an angular chair behind it rests on the
invisible floor, towards the back of the tower room.  Shelves made from
sand and coated with a thick, hardening resin stick out from the walls of
the tower.  On the shelves, there is a large collection of scrolls and
tomes which look remarkably well preserved for being in a desert climate.

E
ladder~
The ladder itself, once illusion is not masking it, looks quite ordinary. 
It has evenly spaced rungs that are durably fastened together to the
frame of the ladder.  Though a bit wider than most ladders, it looks like
it could easily support your weight.
~
E
scrolls~
A few of the scrolls resting atop the shelves are parcially open,
allowing you to catch a glimpse of their contents.  Universally, the
scrolls' contents are detailed pictograms.  No words to read, no
hieroglyphics to translate.  Just a bunch of pictures with crabmen in
them.  The great pyramid also figures into the scrollwork quite heavy as
well.  Browsing through all the scrolls would take a lifetime.
~
E
tomes~
Bound in red, blue, and green leather hide, many of the volumes look
extremely ancient and would probably fall apart at the slightest touch. 
Currently, you have no use of anything you might find in this library.
Browsing through all the tomes would take a lifetime.
~
E
shelves~
Sculpted from sand and layered with hardening resin, the shelves
themselves are an artistic creation.  They have filigree along the edges
and curls along the sides.  And they are still remarkably level and flat. 
A number of scrolls and tomes rest along the various shelves.
~
E
table~
The table which stands towards the back of the room has a relatively
small surface top.  It, like most of the furniture in this odd little
settlement, is sculpted from sand and coated with a resin to preserve its
shape.  Atop the table, there are several claw marks, which appear to be
little more than a crabman's nervous scrapings.
~
E
angular chair~
Much to wide for a normal person, this chair looks to have been made
especially for a crabman.  Sculpted from sand and coated with a hardening
resin, the chair as a slick look to it.

info1~
Upon the scroll, you find detailed information about a complex ritual of
summoning.  You see a diagram of nine standing stones, with a shadow of
the seven stone falling across the middle marker.  Though much of the
scroll is too old to read, you see mention of needing a cauldron,
spider's eye, and a horse's horn.
~
E
info2~
Upon the scroll is a drawing of the desert as it must have looked quite
some time ago.  You can see the great pyramid at its center, btu around
it are three obelisks.  The obelisks stand to the east, north, and south
of the great monument.  At the bottom of the scroll, there is a note:

@RThe eastern obelisk is liable to collapse at anytime.  The underground
water there is weakening its foundation.

chain.  The borders of the scroll are etched with chains of lightning.

Before Twin Castles of Red Sand~
To the south, at the edge of the red desert, stand two castles of
sandstone, whose turrets and battlements rise into the sky as tall as any
dune.  The castle which stands to the direct south has three towers, each
of whose top is graced by tiny green flags which flap in the breeze.  The
shadow of an enormous spiral of sand stretches in front of the castle
from the west.  Adjacent to this castle, to the east, looms its twin. 
The walls between each castle are oriented so that the eastern castle
cannot be reached directly from here.

towers battlements~
At the points along an imaginary triangle, three towers rise up, forming
the corners of the castle.  The battlements which branch off from the
towers have alternating indentations, designed for defense.  The
indentations, though, appear too thin to offer much protection.
~
E
walls~
What look to be individual blocks of red sandstone have been closely
stacked and fit together to construct the walls of this fortification. 
The surface of the sandstone, though, has a dew-like sheen on it.  Set
into the frontmost wall is a flat, driftwood beam several feet across.
~
E
driftwood beam~
A beam of driftwood, larger than most, stands upright against the front
castle wall.  The beam is very old and half-petrified and stands in the
exact middle of the castle wall, like a door.
~
E
dew-like sheen~
On closer inspection, the dew-like sheen is actually a hardened resin
which has been applied to each inch of the castle's surface.  Indeed, the
walls are not made of sandstone blocks, but of sculpted sand!
~
E
spiral shadow~
The shadow which stretches across part of the western twin castle belongs
to a spiraling tower of stand which stands like a silent sentinel to the
west.

Inside the Western Twin Sand Castle~
The inside of this sand castle is relatively plain and not too large. 
The chamber probably stands about thirty feet tall and goes back about
twenty feet.  It has few embellishments.  On the western wall there
stands a brazier forged of a dark, smoky glass and back towards the south
wall stands a statue on a marble pedestal.  The floor is covered with
loose sand and a heap of the sandy material lies against the eastern wall
of the castle.  A single table and chair are the room's only pieces of
identifiable furniture.  A giant beam of driftwood, several feet thick
and wide, hangs from hinges set into the northern wall of resin-coated
sand. The giant piece of driftwood is being used as a door.

Forged from melted black sand, this fire brazier stands about two feet

1 south statue~
Sculpted from white sand and glazed with hardening resin, this statue
bears close resemblance to a human with the head and poise of a cat. 
Obviously feminine, the statue rests upon a pedestal of marble, giving it
a height of about five feet.  While in good condition, a few cracks mar
the base of the statue, probably from age.

~
E
chair **M**~
This red chair is shaped from the sand of the desert and mixed with
resins and pigments to harden and darken the color of the medium.  It has
a low back and long, wide arm rests.  Loose sand has been piled in the
seat of the chair, to provide a softer surface on which to sit.
~
E
driftwood beam~
This thick beam of salvaged wood stands about six feet tall and is
approximately four fe to the northern wall by brackets and strips of
leathery hide.  Two slots, one to either side of the beam, allow for a
much slimmer beam of wood to be placed in between them in order to
barricade the door.  Such a piece of slim wood leans up against the
corner of the chamber.

Inside the Eastern Twin Sand Castle~
The inside of this sand castle is not too large and relatively plain. 
The chamber probably stands about twenty feet tall and goes back about
thirty feet.  It has few embellishments.  On the eastern wall there
stands a brazier forged of a light, tan glass and back towards the south
wall stands a statue on a malachite pedestal.  The floor is covered with
loose sand and a heap of the sandy material lies against the western wall
of the castle.  A single chair and table are the room's only pieces of
identifiable furniture.  A giant, fresh water oyster shell hangs from
hinges set into the northern wall of resin-coated sand, acting as a door.

brazier light tan glass **M**~
This delicate fire burner is truly a work of art.  Graceful limbs of
glass curve down from its fiery bowl to form four, geometrically enhanced
legs.  Around the rim of the brazier, tiny glass forest animals dance and
frolic around a scene of foliage and life.  As the brazier consumes
handfuls of dried desert grass, it gives off a pleasant and smokeless
scent.

1 south statue **M**~
The statue resting upon a malachite pedestal has the features of a
humanoid woman.  She is not old, but nor is she young.  In fact, the
features of the statue are hard to place an age upon.  She wears a
flowing gown and her features and poise are vaguely reminiscent of a
predatory cat.
~
E

This cylindrical wedge of stone is made of a dark green malachite and has
been polished to perfection.  Not a single rough edge or spot remains on
the pedestal.  The sides of the pedestal slope slightly inward.
~

The floor of this castle is covered loosely with sand, giving the
impression that you have never left the desert.  Some of the sand looks
to be piled into a nest or bed along the western wall.

The heap of sand resting alongside the west wall looks purposefully
placed and well piled.  The heap seems reminiscent of a nest or a bed.
~
E
table **M**~
This small, round table has six legs and a round top.  The legs of the
table are sculpted from red sand while the top of the table is made from
black sand.  Both are covered with hardening resin, to help them keep
their shape.  There is nothing on the surface of the table.
~
E
chair~
This simple, high-back chair rests a comfortable distance away from the
table, next to the fire brazier.  Fashioned from pieces of petrified
wood, the chair looks extremely hard.
~
E
giant oyster shell ~
A giant, fresh water oyster has been killed and its shell mounted by
hinges on the northern wall.  Thus, it serves the purpose of a makeshift
door.  To either side of the shell there are notches through which a
sliding bar can be dropped into place, thus keeping anything out of the
castle chamber.  Next to the oyster shell is just such a bar.

The sliding bar next to the door appears to be made of petrified tree
bark.  Not much could probably get through the oyster shell door once
this bar were dropped down into place.

Before Twin Castles of Red Sand~
To the south, at the edge of the red desert, stand two castles of
sandstone, whose turrets and battlements rise into the sky as tall as any
dune.  The castle which stands right in front of you has six, slender
towers, each of whose top is graced by large blue flags which lie limp,
regardless of the breeze.  The walls of the eastern twin castle are
oriented as such that the other castle cannot be reached directly from
here.  In the distance, to the north, stretches a path which runs north,
back into the main desert.

E
towers battlements~
At the points along an imaginary trapezoid four towers rise up, forming
the corners of the castle.  The battlements which branch off from the
towers have alternating indentations, designed for defense.  The
indentations, though, appear too thin to offer much protection.
~
E
walls~
What look to be individual blocks of red sandstone have been closely
stacked and fit together to construct the walls of this fortification. 
The surface of the sandstone, though, has a dew-like sheen on it.  Set
into the frontmost wall is a curved, shell from a giant, fresh water
oyster.
~
E
giant fresh oyster shell~
The giant shell has a speckled white and blue surface, with bits of rock
adhered to it.  From the ridges along its lip, the oyster looks to have
come from a large body of fresh water.  Rather than leaning up against the
wall, the oyster shell looks to actually hang from the castle wall, like
a door.
~
E
dew-like sheen~
On closer inspection, the dew-like sheen is actually a hardened resin
which has been applied to each inch of the castle's surface.  Indeed, the
walls are not made of sandstone blocks, but of sculpted sand!
~
E
spiral shadow~
The shadow which stretches across part of the western twin castle belongs
to a spiraling tower of stand which stands like a silent sentinel to the
west.
~

1 west twin~
The castle whose walls adjoin this one is its exact twin.  Save for
having a different amount of towers and colored flags, both twins look to
be mirror images of the other.

Red Desert Path with a Branching Trail ~
Continuing unimaginatively onward like a caravan slave, the path through
the red desert sweeps ever on its course, from north to south. 
Characteristic red blocks of granite stand to either side of the broad
desert trail, marking, perhaps, the safe points in the path.  Here
though, the trail branches to the east and has cruder blocks of red
granite demarcating it.

Outside of a Large Tent~
A crude, rectangular tent fashioned from strips of animal hide attached
to slender poles has been erected at the end of the desert trail's only
branch.  The tent looks very old and smells of ill-cured hides.  The
front of the tent has leather fastening strips, along where the material
looks to part.  Red blocks of granite stand to either side of a path
which winds to the west and merges with a wider trail heading north and
south.

animal skins hides~
For the most part, the animal skins are light in color and sewn together
crudely with yet more strips of animal hide or leather.  The majority of
the hide is covered with short, soft fur, which reminds you of a desert
hare.  The rest consists of various, unidentifiable shreds of skin.
~
E
slender poles~
These slender poles appear to be a type of reed or bamboo that you have
not seen growing in any part of the desert.  The poles are dead and
lifeless, having been cut sometime ago.
~
E
leather strips~
The leather strips on the front of the tent seem to be meant for securely
closing the tent during times of privacy, need, or rising desert storms. 
Currently, the strips of leather hang loose and unfastened on the tent
flaps.
~

The flaps of the tent are really nothing more than two large animal skins. 
The skins, if the odorous, shaggy fur still attached to them is any
indication, once belonged to a camel.

blocks granite red~
The blocks of granite here are not as smoothly polished or as cleanly cut
as the rest of the blocks which form the desert trail just to the west. 
In fact, not only are the blocks more crudely fashioned, but they are
also crooked and uneven, and look to have been placed here as an after
thought.

Desert Trader's Tent~
Fashioned from animal skins sewn together with crude skill and ribbons of
leather, this small tent stands about eight feet tall and has barely
enough room for three, maybe four people of human height to stand
comfortably.  The interior smells of rotten flesh and contaminated water. 
In the middle of the tent stands a tiny, ironwork brazier, which gives
off a faint amount of heat.  Woven blankets and hides lie on the floor of
the tent, offering but little comfort from the hard, sandy ground. 
Hanging from a support pole in the ceiling of the tent there is an unlit
lantern.  Shadows clamber around the corners of the tent.

This rectangular tent is constructed from supple but dried reeds and
pieces of animal skin.  Two large, shaggy furs hang from the west end of
the central tent pole.  Between the two skins runs a seam along where
leather straps can securely fasten the two flaps closed.

The two flaps of skin hang limply at the western end of the tent.  The
flaps can easily be parted though.
~

A wide, supple reed runs the length of the tent's ceiling, supporting the
fabric of animal hides hanging off of it.  A chain hangs from this
central support and from it, a lantern swings gentle from side to side.
~
E
unlit lantern~
Unlike most lanterns which hold oil, this one holds a simple, fat candle. 
The lantern is forged from pieces of iron melded together and curled with
an eye for detail.  Triangles of glass with a shiny, metallic backing
line the interior of the lantern with the apparent purpose of directing
all the light out of one panel.
~
E
woven blankets~
A few old, woven blankets lie on the floor of the tent.  The blankets,
though riddled with holes and tears, look well cared for.  Woven from
plant fibers, the blankets are a little rougher than you would like.
~
E
hides~
The majority of the animal skins the tent fabric is composed of are
small, furry, and soft.  Many of them remind you of desert hare skins. 
The others look to be either camel or lizard hides.

brazier ironwork ~
Forged completely from iron, the brazier is very elegant in design.  It
has a flowing rim and curving legs.  Pieces of rose-colored glass are set

Red Desert Path - Before A Colossal Sand Castle~
Blocks of red granite run parallel to one another as they create a
north-south section through part of the Naraki Desert.  Located to the east
of the path lies a sandstone castle of colossal size and architectural
complexity.  Towers rise off the main castle wall at the corners of the
massive fortification.  Stained glass windows with frames of petrified
bark are set into both the castle and tower walls while the castle itself
is surrounded by a moat of brown silt.  The red granite blocks part
briefly at the entrance to the castle, right in front of an opaque glass
drawbridge.  Smaller, less grandiose castles of sand stand among the
dunes along the western horizon.

opaque glass drawbridge~
Forged from melted sand, the castle's drawbridge is one solid piece of
thick glass.  The glass is opaque and framed in heavy bronze.  Upon the
center of the drawbridge is a coat of arms.  The drawbridge appears to
some how lower, providing a bridge for the moat of brown silt encircling
the castle.
~
E
stained glass windows~
The stained glass windows are composed of slim ingots of colored red,
black, blue, clear, and tan glass which have been pinched between bronze
framework patterns.  Predominant among the window glasses is a theme of
the ocean.  Within the patterns of glass strange, multi-colored fish and
grasses swim through watery depths.
~
E
walls castle~
The walls of the castle stand tall and wide, topped by dovetailing
parapets.  The surface of the walls have a glossy look to them which is a
result of a special resin which has been used to coat its surface. 
Instead of being built out of individual blocks of stone, the red, sandy
walls are sculpted from the sands of the desert itself and hardened with
this resin.  Lines are engraved into the walls to give the illusion of
stone.
~
E
towers~
Towers of sculpted sand emerge from the corner walls of the grand
fortress The dimensions seem all wrong, however.  They seem too stilted
and flat to actually be part of the castle structure.
~
E
coat of arms~
A three-part coat of arms has been etched into the surface of the
drawbridge.  The first part consists of a shield bearing the emblem of a
pyramid.  Over the pyramid, forming the second part, rise great storm
clouds and a descending bolt of lightning.  To either side of the etched
pyramid, broken chains grasped in crabman claws make up the third part of
the emblem.
~
E
path blocks red granite~
Rectangular blocks of red granite demarcate a path through the red sand
desert, from north to south.  Each block has been polished and smoothed
and bears not a single blemish.

passage over its drawbridge the only possible way into it.  To either

Inside the Colossal Castle~
Behind a door of opaque glass set into the west wall spreads a vast room. 
While the interior of this sand castle lacks many of the fascinating
architectural feats the exterior displayed, it nevertheless has a charm
all its own.  A tattered but serviceable rug stretches from the threshold
to a dais, upon which stands a throne of sparkling glass.  Hung upon the
sandy walls are a variety of tapestries and rough sketches.  At each
corner of the sand-sculpted chamber, there are small iron braziers.

E
opaque door **M**~
Though opaque, you can tell from the glare and the door's texture that
someone has managed to forge glass into a sheet large enough and thick
enough to use as a door to ones abode.  The door has a faint, reddish
cast to it and has been made in the shape of a drawbridge.
~
E
variety tapestries~
The tapestries are made of woven grasses which have been either dyed or
pigmented in some way.  Most of the tapestries consists of nothing more
than everyday scenes of life that the crab people living in this part of
the Naraki Desert share.
~
E
scenes everyday life~
In the first scene, two larger, older looking craw people busy themselves
with watching over a pack of smaller crabs.  In the second, a crab person
is sitting atop a dune of sands, strumming a stringed-instrument with its
claw.  In the third, a robust crabman stands over a hot forge, with a
hammer in one hand and what looks to be an ingot in the other.  In the
final scene, a pair of crab people, identical in every respect, stand
beneath the two moons and a dim aura of light surrounds them.
~
E
sketches~
There are two sketches, both of which represent the same thing, but from
different angles.  Each sketch is a diagrammed representation of the
construction of a vast pyramidal structure.  The diagrams are drawn upon
sheets of beaten papyrus paper with pieces of charcoal and look
relatively well preserved.  The only thing which belies their age are the
cracked, upturned corners of the second diagram.
~
E
diagrammed representations~
The sketches are divided into several sections, with each section
depicting yet another stand in the structure's completion.  From the
underground foundation, to its tip, from its base to its limestone
sheathing, every step of the pyramid's construction has been carefully
documented.  Prominent in both diagrams is the use of crabmen as slaves
and laborers.
~
E
cracked upturned corners **M**~
The resin applied to the surface of the sketched diagrams appears to have
broken down at the corners of the second sketch.  This is probably
because the second section of sketched papyrus is almost twice as thick
as the first.
~
E
dais **M**~
The creatures who constructed this place have a knack for sculpted sand
into the shapes they desire and for making the sand harden.  The dais
stands at the edge of the long rug which extends towards the doorway.  It
is round in shape and stands only a foot or two off the ground.  The
dais, like the walls, ceiling and floor of the sand castle, is sculpted
from red sand.  Atop the raised platform sits a throne made entirely of
glass.
~
E
throne **M**~
Made entirely of glass, an ornate throne sits atop the sculpted sand dais. 
Unlike the opaque door of glass which serves as the drawbridge to the
castle, the glass the throne is made from is clear as crystal and not
solely red in color.  Each section of the throne has been forged from a
different color of class.  The arms of the throne are clear, the seat of
the throne is red, the base and sides of the throne are a light brown,
and the back of the throne is of a rich blue.  The surfaces of the throne
are etched with indecipherable glyphs and symbols.
~
E
rug~
Woven from thin strands of grass and plant fibers, this old and tattered
rug stretches the length of the room.  Though the edges are worn and the
dyes are faded, you can still see the sharp, geometric patterns which
adorn the narrow carpet.
~
E
geometric patterns~
The geometric patterns consists of a series of concentric squares,
circles, and triangles.  Each of the patterns seems to revolve around one
large triangle, which is situated at the center of the rug.
~
E
center triangle~
At the center of the rug, there is a triangle about a foot long.  Around
it, a multitude of geometric patterns spawn across the surface of the rug
wildly.  The pigments on and around the triangle are heavily worn, as
though people stand in this spot more oft than not to address their
grievances to the occupant of the throne.

Within a Sand-filled Tunnel~
Sculpted in the same manner as the castles of sand which stand in the red
desert, a tunnel extends to the east from the secret opening behind the
dais.  The tunnel is taller than you might have expected, but a lot
grimier too.  The walls are coated with a thin layer of slime and there
are a couple of piles of bones stacked up along the floor.  On the floor,
there is a large, metallic basin and set into the side wall is a length
of iron chain.  From here, you can see that the tunnel does not extend
much beyond this point.

As you examine the walls, you make two startling discoveries.  The first,
is that the slime coating the walls smells more than yesterday's dung

instead, saliva.

The metallic basin at your feet is made of steel and has been bolted down
to the floor.  The content of the basin looks to be water, but it is so
cloudy and unappealing that you don't think drinking it would be such a
good idea.  Along the side of the water basin, there is a panel of etched
hieroglyphics.

Red Desert Path~
Impenetrable and immense, the sheltering walls of the canyon loom
overhead to the east, its cliffs sloping inward towards the desert.  And
to the west, spiraling dunes of sand emerge from an otherwise flat,
scarlet plain of sand.  Between the two natural barriers runs a rough but
visible trail.  To either side of the trail stand blocks of red granite,
whose polished surfaces gleam.

canyon walls cliff~
The granite walls of the sunken valley lie just to the east.  The wall
here is so tall that cliffs are formed up above.  However, the canyon
walls slope inward, making scaling the cliffs an impossible feat.  In
places, the rough granite surfaces of the cliffs are tinged with red,
marking them as a probable source for the granite blocks lining the edges
of the desert path.
~
E
spiraling dunes~
Unlike barchan dunes whose sandy crescents dot the majority of the main
desert, the crimsons sand here spiral around a central column of sand,
creating a swirling design in the sandy canvas.  The dunes stand as tall
as a hundred or so feet, and oft block what lies beyond.  Between two of
the slimmer spiral dunes, though, you can catch a glimpse of a red,
sandstone castle to the west!
~
E
polished granite blocks~
Each block has been cut with precision and in the exact same shape and
size as the one next to it.  These rectangular blocks border the edge of
a desert path which courses north to south through this red desert region. 
The path looks well maintained and traveled.

Red Desert Path~
Bordered on either side by blocks of polished red granite, a trail winds
north to south through the red desert.  Dunes of impenetrable sand loom
along the edge of the canyon to the east while to the south, you see the
walls of some type of structure, possibly that of a castle.  To the south
you can also see the tops of similar, castle-shaped structures.  There is
also something strange about the sand to the south that might need
further investigation.

In the Center of the Red Desert Expanse~
Blood-red sand fills your gaze in every direction as rising dunes dot the
landscape.  Blocks of red granite, set in pairs, lie to the far east,
denoting a path through the desert.  Across from the path stands an
imposing castle.  Castles of sand lie in all other directions but they
are no where near as large or impressive as the easternmost one.  Swirls
of sand cascade over the surface of a stone formation to the near south.

Before Two Castles of Sand~
A plain of red sand, hot as burning coals and red as blood stretches out
before you and beyond to the east.  The arid land undulates as dunes of
sand rise and fall across its surface.  Ascending out of the sands,
though, stand two castles.  Each castle is built entirely from sand and
stands of near-equal height.  Their walls have the look of being built
from individual blocks of cut, red sandstone and gleam with a wet look. 
The castle of sand to the west has short, stocky battlements and spindly
minarets rising off its sides.  The castle which stands adjacent to it,
though, has simpler walls and towers.  A drawbridge of woven grass is set
into the small castle to the west while a mass of beaten chitin lies up
against the castle of sand to the north.  The top of a squat tower can be
seen to the south.  In the distance, to the northwest, you can see the
tip of a very large pyramid rising above the castles.
~
[Ssleestaq] should be stretches out to the east and south, the 'you' implies i'm facing south which is damned odd.

E
squat tower~
To the far south stands a squat tower sculpted from sand.  It has no
windows or apparent doors that you can see, but it does seem to be a
purposefully constructed building.
~
E
l west~
The castle of sand which rises to the west is small but detailed.  It has
short, stocky battlements and blood-red minarets branching off of its
side towers.  The castle has no windows, but it does possess a drawbridge
of tightly woven grass.  A plume of smoke rises up from the center of the
castle's roof.
~
E
1 north~
Modest both in design and size, the castle of sand which stands to the
north has no windows and but two towers.  The castle's front is graced by
simple arches and modest pieces of statuary.
~
E
mass beaten chitin~
The mass of chitin shell set into the front of the castle has been
hammered into a roughly rectangular shape.  Attached to the chitin is a
strip of hardened leather, like a handle.  The hammered mass, on closer
inspection, is a swinging door.
~
E
grass woven drawbridge~
Bound together with strips of leathery hide, sections of long-stemmed,
desert grass have been woven together into a drawbridge.  Judging from
the chains hanging down on either side of the gate, it looks serviceable. 
Perhaps you should knock?
~
E
walls blocks red sandstone ~
On closer examination, the walls of the sand castles are not built from
blocks of sand stone.  Rather, the castles have been sculpted by hand. 
Lines carefully drawn into the sand gives the appearance of individual
stone blocks.  Every surface has been coated with a thick, clear resin
which lets the sand maintain its shape.
~
E
modest statuary~
The statuary out front of the sand castle to the north consists of a few
simple sandstone sculptures of miniature crabs.  The crab statuary rests
on the ground, all around the base of the castle.
~
E
pyramid monument tip~
A pyramidal structure looms to the northwest.  Its polished, pale-green
limestone practically gleams.  Along the upper part of the pyramid, near
the tip, you can barely discern several tracks of hieroglyphics.

Within the Modest Sand Castle~
The inside of this sand castle resembles only partially what one might
expect the interior architecture to look like.  The resin-coated walls of
red sand have been etched with lines to give the appearance of blocks of
stone and the floor has been covered with a pigmented resin, to give it a
green, marbleized look.  A few tattered tapestries hang from the walls of
the castle, as well as a mantle which protrudes over a small fireplace. 
Heaps of sand shaped closely to beds rest towards the back of the
chamber, near the fireplace.  All in all, this abode looks quite modest. 
Set into the south wall is a beaten door made of chitin.

Inside a Small Sand Castle~
The first thing you notice about the inside of this small sand castle is
the incredible amount of heat confined within the room.  The walls are
coated with a sooty fill.  In the center of the room, taking center
stage, stands a huge fire pit and forge.  Unlike a metalworking forge,
this one seems to be suited for only forging and blowing glass.  A giant
bellows lies at the foot of the fire pit, as does a basin filled with
some black rocks and dried reeds.  Beside the forge stands a
sand-sculpted rack.  A column of wispy smoke rises from the fiery pit to
escape through an opening in the ceiling.  The walls of this chamber are
unadorned, save for a single tapestry which has been fastened to the
north wall.  To the east stands what looks like a drawbridge made of
woven grasses.

Surrounded by rock and melted sand, a large pit is sunk into the floor. 
The pit is filled with burning black stone and dried reeds, which give
off an incredible amount of heat.  The heat seems to conduct itself up a
column of stone rises up out of the center of the pit.  There are a
couple of hollow cubbies in the column, suggestive of miniature kilns. 
The top of the column looks smooth enough to be able to turn or spin

up against the rack.  Most of the tools seem like they would prove useful
in forging or blowing glass sculptures.
~
E
reeds black rocks basin~
The basin beside the forge is made of a dark, smoky glass and has a
series of imperfections running through it.  Inside the basin, there are
chunks of hard black rock and cut sections of an extremely woody reed. 
Both the reeds and the stone look like they might burn well.
~
E
hole ceiling~
The hole in the ceiling allows all the smoke to escape from the fire pit
and forge.  It is rimmed with a heavy layer of black soot.
~
E
tapestry~
The tapestry hanging on the northern wall has been coated with the same
clear resin that the walls have been treated with.  It is made from high
quality, woven threads and the dyes and embroidery upon the tapestry are
extraordinary.  The tapestry depicts a creature with a body of stone,
wings, claws, and a grim but apathetic look.  In one hand the creature
holds a balance, while in the other he holds an anvil.  All in all, the
fine tapestry looks out of place in this sandy abode.
~
E
woven drawbridge~
Piles of dried brown desert grass have been tightly banded together with
strips of hide to form a working drawbridge.  The surface of the gate
shines and has been lavished with several heavy coats of clear, hardening
resin.  The massive gate is set into the east wall and appears to have an
actual, working mechanism which lowers and raises the drawbridge.  There
is also a bar which can slide back into the wall mounted on the
drawbridge, so that the gate can be held against invaders.

Amidst Strange Sand Formations~
In most cases, the surrounding arid land is level and flat, with its
sands forming protective dunes around the area.  But here, the sands are
piled in miniature dunes and mounds and are wrought with strange designs
and shapes.  There are also a few statue-like sand sculptures as well,
rising up from the sand.  Each formation has a creative touch to it and
could not have been formed by nature alone.  The walls of a large,
sandstone castle lie to the south and southeast.

Sculpted from sand, three statues stand here.  Each statue is nearly

Outside of a Plain-looking Sand Castle~
The dry, arid terrain of the red desert extends to the south.  A
collection of dunes soar one atop the other to the west, blocking all but
the barest glimpse of a north to south trail.  But while seemingly
boundless desert expands to the south, here stands a sandstone castle. 
The castle has no windows or towers; rather, it is but a simple fort
complex with sturdy walls.  A slab of petrified tree bark lies up against
the front of the castle.  To the east, nearly adjoining the walls of the
plain sandstone castle, looms a large but still modest sandstone
construction.

trail~
Bordered to either side by blocks of smooth, polished granite, a trail
winds itself through the desert, taking a north-south path at the eastern
edge of the canyon.  The trail looks moderately traveled from what you
can see from your present vantage.
~
E
slab petrified tree bark 1 north~
Cut at one time from a giant and ancient tree, this slab of bark has
since undergone petrification.  Rectangular in shape, the slab of bark
lies up against the face of the castle, like a door.  The slab is
actually a fashioned cross-section of a tree, and rings can clearly be
seen in the brown-black bark.
~
E

One hundred.  Two hundred.  Three hundred.  After counting as many as
four hundred rings upon the surface of this slab of bark, you grow weary
with determining its age.  Needless to say, it is old.
~
E
walls~
Though the castle lacks battlements or towers, it does have small,
exterior walls which merge with the castle itself.  Mounds of sand litter
the base of the castle walls.
~
E
mounds sand~
Piles of red sand gather in heaps along the base of the castle walls.  At
one spot, the sand appears to be obscuring something beneath the wall.
~
E
castle~
The castle which stands to the north rises maybe forty feet tall.  It has
no windows or battlements or even a drawbridge.  In fact, there does not
seem to be a way into the castle.  The exterior of the castle gleams
faintly, like no sandstone should.
~
E
sandstone~
The sandstone which comprises the bulk of what the plain castle to the
north is built from is, in fact, not sandstone at all.  As you run your
eyes over its surface, you can see traces of an external resin, which has
been applied to the castle.  The clear resin serves, as it seems, the
purpose of hardening the sand to which it has been applied.  The castle
before you is really a sand castle, built entirely of sand.

Beneath a Spot in the Castle's Wall~
Below the wall of one of the sand castles is a small limestone cavern
which stretches back to the south.  While the hole in the cavern ceiling
looks fresh and recent, there is no doubt that this cavern is very old. 
The floor, which can be seen beneath patches of covering sand, has been
scraped smoothed from constant passage and the upper walls, near the
opening, have eroded to fine, rounded edges.  Up above, you can see some
of the foundation stones protruding down through the cavern's ceiling.

foundation stones ceiling~
The foundations stones sticking down through the ceiling of this chamber
are some of the resin-coated blocks of sand that the crabmen use for
building their castles.  These particular blocks are long and thin,
indicating that they are projections from the castle wall.  Just by the
precarious way some of the blocks hang out, you seriously doubt the
crabmen know of this place.
~
E
floor~
Beneath patches of loose sand, you catch details of the smooth, limestone
floor.  It seems as though constant traffic and rubbing has brought the
floor to its current polish.  The only disturbing thing about the floor,
though, is that there are deep scratches and the occasional marking that
looks like a puncture.

$n toils hard and eventually clears enough rock and sand
out of the crack in the ceiling to make it wide enough to pass through.

Scorpions' Lair~
Little more than twenty feet wide and deep, the small, green limestone
cavern is plain and drab.  No exotic formations of rock creep up from the
ground nor descend from the ceiling.  The walls are coarse and the floor
is covered with a thin layer of sand which has no doubt drifted in from
the desert above.  The discarded remnants of many a meal lie around this
cavernous chamber, tossed into the corners of the room.  Near one such
macabre display stands a pool of crystal-clear water.  Reeds of some
green plant grow around the back edge of the water, opposite the cavern's
only entrance.

reeds plant~
Along the edges of the shore grows a variety of aquatic sedge.  The tall,
bamboo-like plant has thin, leafy shoots jutting out from the water. 
Each shoot is segmented and has a strong, musky scent.
~
E
pool water~
The crystal-clear waters of the pool look to be the only pure thing
within the entire cavern.  Remarkable, all the discarded bones have
managed not to find their way into the pool and thus it has been kept
from contamination.
~
E
bones corpses meal discarded remnants floor~
You heave a sigh of relief as you note that not a single body amidst the
piles of discarded corpses is fully humanoid.  In fact, a majority of the
corpses appear to be those of crabmen and fish.

Inside a Plain-looking Sand Castle~
The interior of the rather ordinary castle of sand is as plain as its
outside architecture.  The walls and floor are formed from hard-packed
red sand while the ceiling rises inward, creating a dome.  From the
center of the domed ceiling hangs a crude, but serviceable lantern. 
Along the floor of the castle, there are several piles of loose sand,
some of which have depressions in them.  A slab of petrified tree bark
stands against the wall to the south.

walls **M**~
Sculpted from the bright red sands of the desert here, the walls remind
you of barriers of blood.  The walls appear to be coated with some type
of clear, hardening resin, to help them keep their shape.
~
E
lantern serviceable **M**~
The lantern hanging from the ceiling appears to have been, at one time, a
work of art as well as a light source.  By now, the delicate brass
filigree spiraling off its corners are covered in green corrosion.  You
notice, though, that the oil the lantern burns for fuel is smokeless.
~
E
domed ceiling~
With its highest point being in the middle of the sandy room, the ceiling
arcs slowly to create a dome over the room.  From the center of the dome,
a slender chain has been bolted into the ceiling, from which hangs the
lantern.  A few cracks run through the dome, but they look to have been
recently patched up with globs of resin and handfuls of sand.
~
E
piles loose sand **M**~
In a few places inside the castle, piles of sand rest upon the floor. 
The piles vary in side and shape, but generally, most are about twice as
big around as a barrel of stout ale.  Depressions mar the surface of a
couple of the piles, as though something had been recently sitting upon
them.
~
E
depressions **M**~
The depressions in the sand look as though the crab people of this small
community use these piles of sand as both their chairs and their beds.
~
E
slab petrified tree bark~
Hard as a rock and just as big, the stab of wood standing against the
south wall has been petrified from quite some time.  It is hard to tell
what type of tree the wood once came from, probably an oak or an elm. 
The left edge of the slab is attached to interior hinges and the door
appears to be equipped with a crude bar lock.

findsgold~
Searching through the pile of sand, you discover two things.  The first,
is that this mound of sand doubles as both a chair and a bed from the
denizen of this sandy abode.  The second is a small gold coin, lying just
beneath the bed's sandy surface.

After searching the pile of sand for a few moments, $n smiles 
and tries to nonchalantly pocket a gold coin.

findschiton~
Searching through the pile of sand, you discover two things.  The first,
is that this mound of sand doubles as both a chair and a bed from the
denizen of this sandy abode.  The second is a piece of rough, red chitin,
evidently shed from this crab person.
~
E
rfindschitin~
After searching through the sandy mound, $n holds up a
piece of shed chitin before pocketing it.
~
E
empty~
As you search through the depressions of sand, one thing becomes evident. 
That the denizens of the red desert must use such piles as beds and
furniture.  Judging from the depressions, this one is obviously a bed,
for you can make out the vague imprints of folded crabman legs.
