Passageway of Roots~
Tangled roots form a narrow passageway to the north, their grasping
tendrils and gnarled bark making the going difficult.  The sweet aroma of
pinesap permeates the air, each breath seeming to infuse itself deeper
into the lungs.  Spotted toadstools and basket fungi nestle upon the
rotting leaf litter and decaying tree fall.  Southward, the tunnel of
roots ends at a cobbled road.  A wrecked @Rsign@n lies on its side beside
the path.

Fork in the Passageway~
The passage of roots splits at a t-junction that offers an east and west
exit as well as the southern entrance way.  Overhead, a tangled roof of
foliage has been bound by sticky webs that block out most light, leaving
the under-passages shrouded in gloom.  Dusky brown bracken and spotted
fungi appear to be the only plants that can survive in the barren sea of
gnarled roots and pine needles.

Rocky Clearing~
A ridge of rock allows for a small clearing, centered in the otherwise
mire of roots.  A scattering of bamboo shoots, growing in the shallow
soil, break in colour from the drab browns and blacks of the pines.  A
dense curtain of webs and branches has been draped across most of the
ceiling.  The vegetation to the north appears to be a tad clearer;
perhaps a determined person could squeeze through it and continue onward.

Water-Filled Clearing~
A burbling stream bubbles out of the ground and forms a shallow pool in
the center of a small clearing.  Duckweed and watercress cover the pond
and at the edges, a few bulrushes grow between the grasping roots of the
massive pine trees.  A fallen white pine has carved a swathe of
destruction to the east, allowing passage some way along its shattered
trunk.  The ribbon of water escapes the pool and runs northward, the wall
of roots preventing attempts to follow its path.

A shallow pool of fresh spring water is caught in a basin in the centre
of the clearing.  The crystal clear stream, sparkling as it catches the
sunlight, rushes down a narrow, gravelly course and disappears beneath a
barricade of roots.  The merry burbling of the stream brings tranquility
to this primeval glade.
~
E
duckweed watercress bullrushes~
Thriving around the edges of the pool, spindly bulrushes sway as a passing
fish gently nudges them.  Gleaming leaves of watercress intertwine with
duckweed to create a covering over most of the pool.  The small white
watercress flowers and the occasional pale yellow flowers of the duckweed
add a touch of colour to this sanctuary.
~
E
roots pine tree~
Ominous pine trees tower high above the clearing, their roots planted
firmly in the ground.  The tangled roots twist into an impenetrable wall
preventing all but the smallest of creatures from weaving a path through
their blockade.  The ground is sprinkled with a light covering of pine
needles and remnants of some cones lay strewn about the area.
~
E
white pine fallen destruction~
Although the wood of a large white pine is soft from the years of
decaying, part of it is still strong enough to serve as a pathway for
anyone travelling in this direction.  New undergrowth encroaches over
trees and ferns that were uprooted when the pine crashed to the ground. 
A myriad of insects make their homes in the decomposing trunk, and the
skeletal remains of leaves and long abandoned spider webs lace the fallen
tree with an eeriness of time gone by.

Along a Fallen Tree.~
Shattered branches and torn bark form a difficult but not impossible
passage along the length of a fallen tree.  Widely splayed roots form an
umbrella of dirt and debris to the west, a curtain of branches and spider
webs entangled in its top.  The remaining pine trees crowd close to the
fallowed ground, their outstretched branches attempting to grab as much
light and rain as possible.

Crushed branches of the fallen pine, protrude at awkward angles from

~
E

Dirt and debris tangled across the roots of the fallen pine create an

The fallowed ground, leeched of all its nutrients, struggles to support

Before a Woven Hut~
Dense curtains of intricately woven webs drape across the fallen tree's
former canopy, the broken branches and leaves pulled into together to
form a strange dwelling place.  A web and leaf-litter doorway has been
set into the eastern wall.  Underfoot a lush layer of sphagnum moss and
umbrella fungi spread across the rotting bark.  Below the tree trunk a
narrow opening offers the possibility of continuing northward.

High above the hut, a glimmer of sky can be seen through the gap in the

curtain of webs.  Softly the leaves filter down through the tangle of
branches and vines, to rest peacefully on the ground.
~
E

Lashed together with strands of thick web, the broken branches create a
dome-shaped structure.  A door, made of twigs and leaves interwoven with
web and vine, covers the arch that gives access to this peculiar building. 
Almost imperceptible rustling exudes from the forest floor as a subtle
breeze sweeps a leaf into an erotic tango on the doorstep.
~
E
sphagnum moss umbrella fungi~
Rotting bark, crumbled under the footfalls of many creatures, now
provides sphagnum moss and umbrella fungi with an ideal location in which
to spread their spores.  The nutrients leeched from the decaying tree
encourage vibrant colours to emerge in the moss and fungus as they grow
liberally.

tree trunk opening~
Beneath the trunk of the pine a debris-clogged opening allows some
passage through the tangle of branches and tendrils.  A few broken webs,

Inside a Woven Hut~
Surprisingly spacious, the woven hut has been crafted from dense layers
of web and tree branches.  A few gaps in the ceiling allow some air to
circulate.  Dangling around the opening are four globes, each one
emitting a soft illumination.  In the middle of the room a stump of a
sizable tree branch has been polished and carved into a serviceable desk. 
A web and leaf litter door has been set in the western wall.

Under a Fallen Tree~
A rich muddy loam has formed under the fallen tree, the combination of
water, earth and leaf litter coated in a fine dusting of mould and mildew. 
Duckweed and algae coat the edge of the brackish pools and many of the
tangled tree roots.  The dense canopy overhead lets little light filter
to the ground, leaving the area in perpetual twilight.  A waterlogged gap
in the mass of tree roots to the north allows access onward.

Reeking of decay, these stale pools cannot deter duckweed from occupying

Pine Forest Stream~
A slow moving stream meanders through the tangled walls of roots and
ferns.  At several points its muddy waters spill across the forest floor,
forming miniature bogs that duckweed and watercress thrive upon.  The
tunnels of gnarled trees gather tightly together encircling the water,
their hungry roots digging deep into the ground.  A narrow seam to the
south allows a determined person a way onward.  An equally challenging
opening to the north offers similar opportunity to continue in that
direction.

Sedately meandering through the root-choked soil, a muddy stream
passively erodes the riverbanks, creating many unstable overhangs.  In

Before a Massive Pine~
Dominating the sea of roots are the massive, gnarled tendrils of a
towering pine tree.  With a rough-bark trunk at least ten yards in
diameter, it could be hundreds, if not thousands, of years old.  Some
twenty feet overhead, the tangle of web-coated branches spreads outward,
forming what appears to be a serviceable platform.  An opening under the
looping tree root cords allows travelers to continue westward.

A Tangled Forest~
Roots of the massive trees rise up into a wall of tangled, gnarled
tendrils.  Sphagnum moss and lichen drape from the wood, their mottled
surfaces dripping with moisture.  Muddy pools of water spread underfoot,
a quagmire of mud and watercress making movement a challenge.  Toward the
north, a rise of rock allows the determined to scrabble onward out of the

Precariously balanced roots, reaching up through the surface of the fetid
mire, seem to have been an after-thought of the trees that vied for
sunlight and life.  The gnarled, twisted roots appear to yearn for
fertile soil as they emerge from the depths of the repugnant water. 
Ropes of tangled tendrils hang from the canopy of the massive trees,
choking the undergrowth and denying all a clear path through the
encroaching lianas.
~
E
sphagnum moss lichen~
Moss and lichen cling to the exposed roots and lower trunks of the trees,
stippling the area with patches of dull green and brown. Sphagnum moss
floats on the surface of the water creating the false impression of solid
ground, while the lichens slowly disintegrate rock into soil.  It is clear
from the sickly colour of the moss and lichen that sunlight has not touched
these parts in many years.
~
E
muddy pools quagmire mud~
The air hangs thick with mosquitos as they breed in profusion on the
murky water.  A frog negligently whips its tongue out at this abundant
food source.  The scungy skeleton of a stag lies half submerged in the
stagnant pools - a sure sign that unseen treacheries lie beneath the
surface.  The reek emanating from the quagmire discourages even the most
hardy of creatures from lingering in this part of the forest.
~
E
watercress~
The white flowers of the ever-persistent watercress give some relief from
the monotony of the dank forest.  Heart-shaped leaves glimmer faintly as
they reflect the meagre light that manages to invade this dingy area. 
Poisonous marshwort, an almost spitting image of watercress, lures the
untrained with its pale flowers and slender leaves.  Confusing one with
the other could prove to be a fatal mistake.
~
E
rise rock~
Jutting out of the dirty brown mire is a slime-covered rock, still rough
from the lack of exposure to the more corrosive elements.  Beetles and
slaters scurry over the rock, thriving off the rancid vegetation.  Fresh
scratch marks exposing the rock indicate that a creature has recently
struggled in this direction, seeking firmer ground.

At the Edge of a Fairy Ring~
The remnant of an ancient tree stump sits in the center of a grassy
clearing.  Encircling it is a swathe of brightly capped toadstools,
forming an almost perfect ring.  Walls of tangled roots rise up around
the clearing, the mass of wood stretching over ten feet in height.  The
dark-green needles of the towering pine trees spread out above the
ground, their matted branches encased in webs.

Shrouded in a tangle of abandoned webs are the hollowed-out remains of
what must have been a towering pine.  The wood of the stump is smooth
from elemental exposure and a wreath of pale blue forget-me-nots grows in
its centre.  Sparkling with dewdrops, a magical ambiance emanates from
the ancient stump.
~
E
toadstools ring swath~
Toadstools, flecked with luminescent white spots, rise out of the ground
like a scarlet sea and surround the ancient stump in an almost perfectly
round circle.  The earth inside the ring has been trampled into a mottled
pulp of limp brown grass, whilst outside the circle, the grass is plush
and vibrant.
~
E

A wall of knotted roots rises out of the ground and towers high above the
clearing.  Drifts of pine needles lie thick against the wood, where
prevalent breezes have neatly stacked them.  Tyrannous strands of web
choke the branches and entwine the spindly needles in a deceitfully
fragile trap.

Rainbow Pool~
Surrounded by lush bulrushes and flax sits a rainbow hued pool.  The
multicolored waters ripple as water bubbles up from the center, perhaps
from an underground stream.  A tricking stream burbles way from the
enchanted pond and flows eastwards, as it goes it turns to a mundane
muddy color.  The towering trees spread their roots across the ground
forming an impenetrable barrier in all directions.

Choked with waterweeds and young-growth bulrushes, the muddy stream slows
here to a gentle trickle.  A layer of duckweed, the tiny green leaves
home to a swarm of mosquitos and water beetles, spreads across the

masses of tree roots, the stream barely providing enough liquid for the
towering giants.

Bramble Wall~
A verdant wall of thorns encircles a clearing filled with a patchwork of
clover and thistles.  The tightly packed brambles encase the roots and
lower branches of the towering trees, effectively blocking any movement

layers of web, a few cocoons dangling down from them.

Tendrils of moss and ivy drape across the cave mouth, their leaves and
tips strangely brown as if dried by the sun.  Mounds of neatly stacked

Inside the Cavern~
A dry heat radiates from the rocks around the cavern entrance, strange
runes encrusting their surface.  Although not hot enough to burn, they
quickly make things feel like a desert.  The floor of the cave has been
worn smooth, strange whorls covering the ground where something has
repeatedly crawled or dragged itself along.  Splitting the western wall
of the cavern, a narrow opening spirals away into the darkness.  Years of
the acrid smoke have formed a scattering of crystal fragments upon the
rocks within the opening, their hexagonal structures reaching a few
inches in length before shearing off.

Smoothed by many years of repeated friction, the eroded floor displays

A narrow opening, set into back in the west wall, admits a draft of stale

In a Massive Pine~
The massive tree bifurcates sending branches in all directions, the main
trunk of the tree continuing upward through the sea of leaves and wood. 
A particularly stout beam juts out to the south; its surface levelled to
allow it to be traversed with ease.  Densely woven webs drape between the
clustered trees, several entangled together to form a branch highway. 
Wooden slats have been spiked into the main tree trunk, creating a
passageway around its sizable girth to the west or north.  The lush
growth and spreading webs obscure what lurks below, although a fall from
this height would not be pleasant.

have an innate sense of perfect balance.

Evenly spaced slats, hewn out of the finest wood, jut out from the trunk,

inhabitants.

Secured tightly together by sticky webs, the branches construct a wide
highway.  Most of the bridge is wide enough for several drider to
traverse at a time, making movement between the platforms easy.  Some
distance beneath the bridge, the lower branches of the tree, laced with
excess web, spread out, hiding all that lies below.

Branch Highway~
Clear of lesser branches and cut until it is almost level, the massive
branch stretches outward toward another towering tree.  Bridging the gap
between the two firs is a narrow walkway of silk and pine planks, its
center dipping below the edge of the branch's end.  Overhead another
walkway cuts through the forest canopy, the strands of silk and pine
needles forming a seemingly solid bridge.

Hewn to be almost horizontal, the unerringly straight branch extends

Linking the two branches together, the wooden walkway lies securely
fastened in a silken web cradle, which is suspended from the branches

Pressed against the rough bark of the main trunk, it is possible to see a
single room hut woven from branches and web, a narrow walkway of wooden
slats and web rope stretching out to its entrance.  A few feet below,
steps have been cut into the tree allowing someone to scrabble down to
the walkways beginning.  Jutting from the gnarled surface of the trunk,
are pine beams, allowing passageway around the trunk, to the south.

A wooden platform encircles the mighty pine, its planks held in place by
woven silk rope.  A bridge of pine slats and silk stretches northward,
its center dipping down below the platform's level.  Cut into the trunk
to the south, a circular opening offers access to the inner tree, the

dangles in the doorway.  A walkway of branches winds westward, the

Carved from the heart of the pine tree, the wooden hut appears warm and

Despite the damage to the tree it appears to be in good health,
apparently not affected by the sizable excavation.  A spiral staircase

door, the wooden likeness of a spider covers the only exit of the hut. 
Protruding from the right side of the doorway are four peculiar branch
stubs that seem to be used as pivots for opening and closing of the door,
as there is a sizeable gap surrounding each one that has been roughly
patched with a fine coating of the durable drider silk.

Landing Platform~
A net of rope and vines spreads out at the fork of a solid-looking
branch, a knotted rope dangling down from a higher limb, offers the bold
an opportunity to swing eastward.  Toward the west the wide canopy of a
massive fir tree spreads its limbs outward.  Jutting from the main trunk
is a woven hut; the structure precariously perched on the northern limbs.

Piercing the upper layer of the dense canopy, the massive fir tree,

themselves to the tangled webs.

Branch Highway~
The narrow bough has been reinforced with slats of pinewood, allowing for
a relatively easy passage in either an eastern or western direction. 
Overhead the tangled canopy of branches spreads outward, the dark green
needles drenched with sparkling dew and sticky webs.  Toward the north a
wagon-sized hut perches on the ends of the northerly branches, its
circular doorway painted a deep blood red.  The massive trunk of a
towering fir tree stretches skyward to the west, its highest limbs
reaching well over three hundred feet in height.

A blanket of webbing encases the bark, branch and vine walls of the

High Platform~
A platform of white-washed wood spreads among the forest greens.  A
netting of spider silk stretches from their tips to the overhead
branches, forming what appears to be slender pillars of web.  Slats of
wood cover the limbs that thrust from the fir tree's trunk, allowing
travelers access to the forested canopy to the east and north.  A spiral
stairway, cut into the bole of the tree, leads upward into the high
canopy.

A domed room of web encases the trunk of a massive pine tree, the spun

Tufts of apricot-hued vines entangle the tree branch, clusters of cream
flowers covering their ends.  The sweet smell of nectar fills the air
from the blooms, a handful of mason bees darting between each of the
petals.  The high canopy rises around the walkway, the trees towering
over fifty feet before their branches end.  A woven hut dangles from
silken cords to the north, a circular door allowing access to its webbed
interior.  More huts dot the forest to the east and north, their mottled

Woven Hut~
Cocooned in layers of spider silk and branches, the woven hut would be
near impossible to detect from the ground.  About thirty feet in diameter
and a near perfect circular shape, it consists of a single room with
openings in the southern and eastern walls.  In the chambers middle, a
nest of bracken and ferns make up a serviceable bed.  The desiccated
husks of deer and birds dangle from cords in the ceiling; their grim
remains obviously a driders snack.

Disturbingly suspended from the hut's ceiling the brutally flayed

Funnel Web Tunnel~
The layers of soft silk have been spun together to form an opaque tunnel,
reminiscent of a spider's lair.  Tangled branches and web-twined rope
reach outward from the structure, adding stability to the woven
passageway.  Toward the south, the tunnel ends at a circular hole carved
into the trunk of a massive tree.  To the north, the tunnel branches into
a side corridor, cutting westward while the rest of the walkway continues
onward.

Acrid bands of black ash lash the pale silken walls, as if a burning whip

together.  A broken paper lantern dangles from the high ceiling, its torn

The woven tunnel bends around the gnarled branch of one of the towering
pines, the silken road cutting through the trees in an easterly and

outer surfaces painted with skittering spiders and slithering serpents. 
Underfoot, the sturdy, lace-like lattice of web and branch provides solid
footing, allowing for ease of travel among the high trees.

Last year's needles lie across the floor, scattered like the dead from a
bloody battle.  A few insects brave the encasing web to feast upon the
decaying matter.  Out the southern door, the web tunnel weaves like an
exposed intestine, the silken structure cutting sharply through the high

branches of the mighty pines, reinforcing the silk against the buffeting

Silken Room~
Bolts of dyed silks bedeck the branch-formed walls of the circular room,
the bright cloth gleaming with a soft luster.  A high desk rests against
the southern wall; its redwood polished and carved with inserts of
flights of cranes and mountain scenes.  A hammock of spun silk has been
draped between two branches, allowing the room's occupants to rest above
the floor.  A curtained arch in the northern wall appears to be the only
exit from the room.

Draping negligently from the leafy branches that form the walls of this
large circular room are cascading bolts of silk dyed garishly bold
colours.  The flowing cloth adheres to the web wrought walls in loosely
overlapping folds.
~

desk redwood carved inserts~
Shaped to perfectly fit the curve of the wall, the high desk dominates
the majority of the southern arc.  Ornately etched into the solid wood,
depictions of soaring cranes flying high above jagged mountain ranges
cover the polished surfaces.

hammock~
Thick strands of elastin web have been loosely woven to create a
supportive hammock.  Strung between two sturdy branches, the hammock
swings about waist-height off the floor.
~
E
curtain arch~
Draped across the archway in the northern wall, a gossamer thin curtain
hangs in luxuriant folds.  The arch itself is constructed by two flexible
branches, one on the east side, the other on the west, which have been
drawn together by a large quantity of durable web.

Heartwood Chamber~
Carved from the richly grained heart of the ancient pine tree, the
circular chamber stretches over twenty feet in circumference.  The wooden
floor and walls have been worked with sweet-smelling oil until their
grain gleams with a luster.  An archway in the eastern wall leads into a
vaulted chamber, the walls and ceiling formed from woven silk.  An
opening in the north leads out on to a balcony, the web-coated forest
spreading out beyond it.

Branch Lookout~
The emerald hued canopy spreads across the landscape, the flickering of
paper lanterns dancing between the foliage.  Below the branch lookout the
dense forest gathers its limbs close together between the pines run
silken walkways, their looping strands connecting a scattering of web
houses that between the massive trees.  An opening in the trunk to the
south allows entrance into a chamber carved from the very heart of the
tree

[Azerin] jump off?
[Guin] Acode needs to dump them in 8516 with inflict 500 damage.
[Guin] Seltha says - "you should make a fun script with a bunch of rooms
on the way down, each room does damage..  eg: falling thru the tree: as
you continute to plummet toward the ground, a branch whacks you in the
face ** DISMEMBERS ** ...  that way by the time they hit the ground you
could have done more than 1000 damage

The dense foliage hides the drider houses from the ground below.  A
smattering of orange and golden leaves intermingle with the dominant pine
needles to create a mosaic of color.

Elegant round paper lanterns swing gently in the breeze. Painted in dusky
reds and yellows, with black patterns of fine spider webs and leaves
around the edges, a soft glow flickers in the centre of the lanterns.

Nets of silvery white webs form these silken walkways.  Tightly

Hidden Chamber~
Pine panels have been woven together with silk rope to form the room,
their surfaces unfinished and sightly rough.  A strip of bark runs along
one edge, clearly the crafter spent little time on their construction.  A
single paper lantern dangles from the roof, its soft moonlight
illuminating the room.  Underfoot, sheets of webbing have been bound with
branches to form a mostly stable floor.

pine panels silk rope~
Unevenly cut panels of pinewood are lashed together by haphazardly spun
silk rope.  In several places along the plaited rope, desperate attempts
of repair have been undertaken to prevent the twine from unravelling
fully.  Many gaps are present between the hurriedly constructed walls,
inadvertently allowing plenty of ventilation to flow through the room.
~
E
paper lantern~
Hanging on a short silken rope, the solitary paper lantern swings gently
on an elliptical path as a cold draft whistles through the room.  The
fine panels on the fragile wicker frame sit rather skewed, and their
battered surfaces look as though they have been caught in the middle of a
violent crossfire.
~
E
sheets webbing branches floor~
Dense sheets of web cover the floor of this shoddy room with a layer of
grimy material.  Roughly hewn branches protrude through the grey-white
mesh, their leaves a rusty brown colour.  Extensive repairs have been
made in several places in order to keep the floor in a relatively good
condition.

Falling.......~
Falling...midway down the length of the ancient pine.  Trees and branches
intertwine to form a semi-solid barrier, reaching out to grab at skin and
clothes, arms, legs..even face.  Just below, a thick bough, the size of a
giant's arm lays in wait...
