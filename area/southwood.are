Winding Southern Road~
Flanked by a rough cliff on the west side and a steep drop to the east,
the dirt path winds in a generally southward direction.  A few stones
scattered across the road create a hazardous walk.  Above the crumbling
shelf of rocks, a dense forest breathes life and sounds of animals echo
upwards from the chasm below.  Cast by the dense, verdant canopy of huge
beech trees, deep shadows mottle the ground with varying shades of grey. 
To the south, the road dips and turns, ducking behind a jutting rock
before disappearing from view.  The road meanders towards a stone-white
bridge and across the eastern valley floor.  A sea of green grass
disperses into the area, the dusty brown and green stems swaying in the
breeze.

Cliffside Trail - Beside a Muddy Stream~
The trail dips as it heads in a southerly fashion, winding around a
boulder as it descends into the grassland.  Climbing steeply, the road
cuts across the side of the valley as it heads towards a white-stone
bridge.  Flanking the road is a muddy stream it's swirling waters feeding
watercress and the occasional flax stand.  Ripe seed-heads of rye and
barley grass sway in the strong winds that whip across the valley floor.

Murky silt blocks the view of the bottom of the stream, but it cannot be

Cliffside Trail - Beneath a Rock Shelf~
A crumbling rock shelf rises to the west; the road, running beneath it,
gaining shelter from an oncoming wind.  A muddy stream follows the road,
the waters allowing a few ferns and flax bushes to grow in the deep
shadow of the towering cliff.  The valley basin stretches as far as the
eye can see, the grasslands swaying in the breeze.  To the north, the
trail works its way up the side of the cliff.

Cliffside Trail - Winding Path~
Trailing alongside the murky water, the winding path continues to weave
its way through the forest.  Small dust clouds, billowing as each gust of
wind whips through, create a dusty visage across the eastern forest.  A
crumbling ledge towers over the road, providing plenty of shade for any
passers-by to sit beneath and rest.  As the path continues to follow the
stream to the south, drifting slightly away from the riverbed in places.

Cliffside Trail - Beside a Muddy Stream~
Running alongside the muddy stream, the path continues in a north-south
direction, the murky waters denying any passage to the east.  A cliff,
deteriorating as age slowly takes a firm grasp upon it, towers to the
west, casting elongated shadows across the trail. Redirecting the
buffeting wind in a random direction, the massive cliff continues to the
south.  Fragments and shards of tiny rock clutter the riverbed making
passage a bit more difficult.

Cliffside Trail - Near a Fallen Tree~
Towering over the trail to the north, an enormous cliff looms covetously
over the narrow road.  The cliff abruptly veers to the west here, and the
path continues to wind alongside its base.  Off to the east a stream can
be seen, although the proliferation of thick grasses and bushes prevents
any easy travel in that direction.  At some point in the recent past, a
huge oak tree has fallen, blocking off the forest to the south.

Forest Trail~
Flourishing noticeably, the trees here are enormous in comparison to
those that grow off in the distance.  The path is well worn and looks as
though it has been travelled upon recently.  Far off, the top of a jagged
cliff barely peeks over the tips of the towering trees.  The forest is
far too dense to the north and west for travelling through, but there is
a steep, yet climbable slope to the east, although the rise blocks any
view in that direction.

The path rises slightly here, overlooking a portion of the surrounding
forest.  A sharp descent drops into a more densely wooded area, the
treetops just barely visible in the distance.  Crowding the path, thick-
stemmed weeds grown in fat clumps, some with delicate, pale flowers and
others gone to seed.  The path passes by a gnarled, aged tree and begins
to gently ascend beyond.

Weeds of various colours lie just before an overcrowded forest, halting
any trail that strays from the main path.  Many different trees fill the

either through the interference of fauna or the tenacity of the wind

Forest Trail - By a Colossal Oak Tree~
A colossal tree, growing steadfastly in the centre of the road, splits
the well-travelled trail in two, causing both paths to veer on either
side of the wide bole, before coming back together just beyond.  Wild
grasses grow in profusion around the gnarled tree, their delicate blades
crushed by the footfalls of passers-by.  Partially obstructing the view
of the sky, the vast canopy of this lofty oak stretches high above the
other nearby trees.

Forest Trail - Light Woods~
The winding trail continues through the sparsely tree-populated section
of the forest: rays of light streaming through the branches illuminate
the entire area.  While few in number, the trees have matured to their
maximum potential; bright green leaves, clumped together on well-grown
branches creates a wall of dense vegetation.  As leaves drift down from
thick branches, they litter the forest floor with a myriad of autumnal
hues dappling the floor; the occasional grass clump sending bright green
blades through the groundcover.  An ancient, gnarled tree lies to the
north, splitting the well-travelled path in half before it continues
beyond the tree as a single path once more.

Forest Trail - Base of a Craggy Hill~
The well-travelled dirt path inclines up a steep, craggy hill; roots from
the nearby trees protrude from the earth and have been used for leverage
in the sharp ascent.  While not densely populated, the matured trees and
their many leaf-filled branches still create a thick verdant canopy,
making long distance sight rather difficult.  Smothering the forest
floor, leaves of many shades mottle the ground, with an occasional root
and clump of grass sprouting from the ground beneath.

Forest Trail - Upon a Craggy Hill~
The trail drops steeply to the north, winding precariously down a craggy
hill.  The trees pull back from the edge of the hill, their roots poking
out from its near-vertical face to provide handholds for the descent. 
Fallen leaves, now in various shades of decay, clutter up the ground at
the bases of the trees.  Atop the hill, the thin forest can be seen
stretching across the vale below, a canopy of leaves, varying greatly in
colour, nearly disallowing any view of the ground, but still in a few
places, the leaf-strewn floor can be seen.

Forest Trail - Before a Massive Tree~
The trail splits here, avoiding one particularly massive tree that grows
to the south.  Its gnarled roots spread over the path, leaving the
surface uneven and precarious.  Smaller trees grow densely on either side
of the path, their foliage bright and green.  Fallen tree leaves carpet
the ground in varying stages of decomposition.  A break in the trees
lying to the west leads to a more open, well-groomed path, flanked by
younger trees.

Forest Trail - Fallen Tree~
Winding through the dense foliage, the path runs before a massive, fallen
tree trunk, which is much to large to cross in the north.  Long-fallen
and ground-embedded leaves, in varying forms of decomposition, construct
the path.  Newly fallen leaves drift silently between the towering trees,
roving across the forest floor until they find a place to settle.  No
particular genus of tree dominates the formation of the forest - elms,
oaks, pines, and innumerable others filling in the empty spaces.  A small
patch of mushrooms, growing up to and upon the long-ago fallen trunk,
stick out from the leaf-littered floor.

This huge trunk looks as though it fell a long time past, decay has
started to soften the pale flesh and small insects have burrowed into the

to the ground and lie festering on the forest floor nearby.

Forest Trail~
Growing in a misshapen circle to the northeast, the verdant rows of trees
halt any travel with their tangled roots protruding from the moist earth
and massive trunks competing for enough space to spread their leafy
boughs.  The leaf-filled path is covered with the decomposing, tree-fall
that has accumulated over the years, while other, more recently fallen
debris, are tossed about the area with an occasional gust of wind.  The
bark on nearby trees has been shredded and torn off the wide boles
exposing the pale wood beneath, stark evidence of recent animal activity
in the surrounding forest.  A few small tracks disturb the soft ground,
wandering off in various directions.

Forest Trail - Amidst the Declining Trees~
The stature of the forest slowly dwindles away as the trees decline in
size.  Continuing to hug the leaf-littered path, even the bushes seem to
lessen in size, the berries dotting the scrubby plants not yet ripe
enough to pick.  As the trail continues south, it turns from tree-fall to
trampled wild grass, as it exits the leafy forest.  Rocks the size of
stout dwarves lie against the immature trees greatly reducing their
ability to grow.

Grassy Field - Beside a Dense Hedgerow~
Clumps of knee-high green grass sprout all over the dry ground; small
divots ripple the soil with hair-thin cracks emanating from the compacted
earth.  Scattered across the pastureland, small stones varying in size
from small pebbles to large boulders lie, half-buried in the dirt, the
more sizable rocks positioned just before the fringe of a mighty forest. 
An occasional tree, no more than a sapling, grow with tiny branches
barely shading the area.  A dense hedgerow grows to the west, blocking
any movement in that direction.

Grassy Field - Border of the Forest~
A network of diminutive cracks criss-cross the dry earth, breaking the
arid ground into a brickwork formation.  A lack of care and misfortune of
weather has lead to baked, drought-ridden grassland; the only sign of
life is an occasional wind-blown leaf floating in from the northern
forest.  Towering trees run rampant, growing in countless numbers to the
north where a cramped forest seals off any passage in that direction.

The field sprawls in all directions, sharp edged, brown-tipped grasses
growing from the arid, dusty ground.  A fine network of cracks splits the

unlikely to reach maturity.  Rocks and pebbles are scattered around the

The burnt out remains of a stone and thatch cottage stands to the east,
its door gone and shutters hanging in tatters.  Grass sprouts from what
remains of the thatching upon the ruined roof, the green stems beginning
to camouflage it.  The forest grows up to the southern wall of the crib
the branches of a particularly massive beech tree overhanging the entire
building.

stone thatch cottage crib~
Built from squared blocks of white stone, interlaid with rich-grained
wood around the door and window frames, the cottage seems to be in pretty
good shape considering that it has, at some point, been subject to fire. 
In some places on the roof, the thatching has fallen to the ground as a
result of disrepair; soft green grass has started to sprout in the denser
patches, camouflaging the rooftop with the surrounding forest.
~
E
beech tree branches~
Lengthy, well-leafed branches arch over the decaying roof of the small
cottage, a few twigs and fallen leaves mottling the holey thatching. 
Quite smooth silvery grey bark covers the trunk, with sporadic patches of
pale brown wood on the lower portion of the tree that has been exposed
due to recent animal activity.

Inside the Ruined Cottage~
Constructed from white-stone and a rich-grained wood the cottage has
survived without maintenance reasonably well.  The interior of the single
roomed house shows signs of fire damage; smoke stains marring the surface
of the windowsills.  The remnants of broken, rotting furniture lie
scattered over the earthen floor.  The thatching is missing in several
locations, the decaying clumps of roofing lying upon the ground.  Windows
in each wall allow views of the outside fields and forest.  Standing
firmly lodged in the eastern wall, the small door should open out into
the lightly forested area, but due to long years of weathering and a lack
of general maintenance it has been jammed shut.

Cottage Before the Woodlands~
Nestled amongst the weeping branches of an ancient willow tree stands a
run-down cottage.  Whitewashed walls have turned slightly yellow in
colour, and peeling layers of clay lie around its base.  The thatching on
the roof has begun to decay, several holes appearing in it.  A solitary
window looks out upon the woodlands here, and a small warped door stands
fast, unable to be moved an inch.  Overrun with weeds, the remains of a
fair sized vegetable garden stretch out beneath the trees, the once
tilled earth now awry with rampant plants.

This worn-down cottage is settled deep amidst the trees of this dappled

roof.  The back door of this cottage has become warped - twisting so

It is possible to see where straight neatly tilled lines of earth lay in
the garden, the ground still slightly bumpy from whenever the plot was

some woody marrows, and a few other vegetables now compete with the
obdurate weeds that vie for dominance in the nutrient rich soil.

Light Woodlands - Brambles~
A goat track winds through the light woodlands, its leaf-littered surface
often impossible to distinguish from the forest floor.  Spilling out from
between the southern trees is a wall of densely packed brambles; each
tangled vine coated with countless barbed thorns, ready to tear into
exposed flesh.  The remains of a few unfortunate animals lie scattered
underneath the prickly plants.

Greenvale - Southern Woods~
Pale-green ivy sprawls over the tangled roots of the forest, its vines
entwining up to the lower branches of many of the beech trees.  A winding
goat-track wanders beside the sea of ivy its borders slightly overgrown
by the vigorous plant.  A few tufts of wild barley grow on the east side
of the path, their seeds already eaten by hungry creatures.

Greenvale - Southern Woods~
Jutting out of the dense fern-dominated foliage is the jagged,
moss-covered surface of rock.  The shelf of stone rises upwards as it
continues north until its peak clears the leafy canopy by several feet. 
A lush covering of leaf-litter and dirt cap the spire, leaving enough
soil for slender willow and maple saplings to sprout.  Overhead the
mature trees spread their branches in a wild canopy, the red maple leaves
and pale-green of the oaks forming a tapestry of colour.

anyone's guess - perhaps there is a deep crevice hidden beneath the green

Under the mottled canopy, a grass lined goat track winds.  Ferns and
bracken encircle the path, although none grow upon it.  Speckled-flowered
hollyhocks grow in the sun-filled glades that dot the airy woodlands.  A
jutting shelf of rock rises to the west, its moss-covered surface rising
above the tree's leafy canopy.

The intersecting corner of a north and west running fence pokes above the

Field of Grass - Old Streambed~
Running through the dusty field is a shallow streambed, its surface
covered in lush dock plants and spine-covered thistles.  Smooth stones
poke out from under the vegetation, their surface worn by the now absent
water.  Sun-soaked leaves of the grasses have turned from green to gold. 
Encircling the grasslands is a wide swathe of gloomy forest, the towering
trees spreading as far as the northern hills.

streambed smooth stones~
Most of the stones are between one and two inches in diameter, although
it is possible to find larger and smaller ones in the dried up streambed
that runs through the field.  Now well and truly dehydrated, the only
plants that seem to be able to survive in the stony bed are weeds and
thistles.
~
E
new spine-covered spine dock thistles plants vegetation~
Downy violet flowers cover the thistles with a swath colour, breaking the
monotony of the mid-green stems.  Biting thorns cover the slightly
brittle shoots, protecting the plant from being viewed as a food source
for hungry animals.  A few quite large leaves spill over the stony
terrain, lush green in colour.  Standing upright from the centre of the
leaves are several brittle stems, of an almost black hue, the tops of
which are crowned with tiny dark burgundy seed-heads.

Old Stream Bed Across the Grasslands~
Winding through the dusty ground is a stone-littered streambed, it's
edges flanked by rows of wheat and barley grass.  Chickweed and fennel
grow between the rocks, their delicate stems drooping from lack of water. 
Around the base of most of the grasses the tender new shoots have been
nibbled at, leaving the remaining tougher leaves untouched.

Fields of Grass~
A stack of smooth, water-worn rocks has been piled into a rough cairn
besides the remains of a twisted and corroded plough.  Grey lichen almost
completely covers the crumbling wood.  The plough head is orange with
rust, its blade pitted and worn; a split in its edge the result of an
unseen rock.  A dry streambed winds southwards, a few thistles growing
along side it.

A large flat rock creates the base of a cairn, the surface appears to

Another smooth stone rests upon the base; nestled into the dip, while
several other chunks of rock varying in size and shape, precariously
balance on top.  It appears that over time, passers-by have added to the
pile, which now looks like it would be quite a challenge to do without

Forests Edge - Grasslands~
Wild wheat and barley grow in amongst the scattered oak and poplar trees
that make up the verge of a dense forest.  The woodlands spread
northwards, covering the rising hills in a swathe of green, and eastwards
where they become increasingly tangled amongst each other.  Fallow
fields, now filled with wild grasses, reach westwards, their leaves a
mixture of emerald-green and dusky-gold.

Field of Grass - Fence Line~
The sunbaked ground lies cracked and furrowed beside an ancient-looking
wooden fence.  Dried weed and wilted wildflowers have shrivelled and
died, a lack of water clearly to blame.  Tiny honeybees buzz around the
grasslands, on their journey to find a better source of nectar.  Mottled
greens and browns of a massive woodland stretch to the north, east and
south: a wide cul-de-sac of forest forming around the sun-drenched fields.

Dry Fields~
The fields spread onwards.  Golden kernels of wheat droop on brown stems,
bending under the weight of the ripening grain.  Cracked and dry, the
ground has begun to suffer from lack of rain.  However, the crops appear
to exhibit little wilting, perhaps fed from an unseen water source. 
Beyond the grasslands a forest spreads, the grains intermingling with
ferns at the woodland's edge.

The grasslands and ferns of the forest spread under the trees forming
mottled green-brown undergrowth.  A crumbling shelf of rock juts out into

and milkweed grow upon the shallow ground around the ridge, despite the
poor, rock-filled soil.

Field Beside a Run-down Fence~
Weatherworn posts barely support the remains of rotting wooden planks
that form the run-down fence.  Perhaps the only reason the fence still
stands is the masses of vines that entangle it.  Slender thorns cover the
tendrils, discouraging animals from grazing on the clusters of pale-
yellow leaves.  Northwards, beyond the fence, lies a collection of
buildings, perhaps the farmstead of the field's owners.  Grass and grains
grow in masses to the east and south, their leaves turning golden-brown
under the harsh sun.

Shorter than the rest of the grass in these fields, it appears that this

Grassy Field - Edge of the Forest~
The grassy field continues in all directions except south, where it is
bordered by a thick fringe of leafy green trees.  A few large rocks,
about a foot in diameter, lie in the grass the edge of the forest; light
refracting off minerals caught in their rough faces causes them to
glitter slightly.  Tiny daisies and bluebells grow in the shade of the
trees.

A thick fringe of tall, slender deciduous trees borders the field to the

lush and green in the loose soil, the tall blades rippling slightly as a
soft breeze passes.  The occasional daisy and bluebell grow in colourful
patches, while more rarely a dandelion shows its round, sunny face.

Slender, closely packed trunks of tall trees form a barricade with their
tangled roots and branches, halting any desire to travel into their
confines.  With the lack of soil in which to firmly lodge their roots, it
is amazing that these trees have grown to maturity, with a broad leafy
canopy fed predominantly by sunlight - a meagre amount of nutrients

Grassy Field - Dried Riverbed~
Slender seed heads of wild wheat and barley intermingle with the lush
green grasses; like a broad verdant sea, the pastoral fields sway
lullabilically in the winds.  Weaving between the fragile stems, small
wiry vines spread, their writhing tendrils covered in thorns.  Countless
smooth rocks lie half-buried in the soil, perhaps the remains of an
ancient riverbed.

Grassy Field - A Scraggly Bush~
Surrounded by the dry seed heads of wild grains, a scraggly bush grows,
its trunk and branches covered in a mass of sharp-looking thorns. 
Oily-green leaves grow beside the thorns, protected from predators of the
vegetation.  Around the thorn bush a lattice of fine fissures cover the
ground, forming an intricate web of minute cracks.  The southern border
of this pasture is awash with the tangled roots of trees, their dense
canopy casting a little shade across the grassy field.

Wild maize, barley and wheat grow sparsely in the dry soil, their slender
leaf tips browning in the hot sun.  Almost hidden in the long grasses
lies a circle of smooth stones stacked around a shallow depression; the
plants growing within the dip seem greener and healthier, perhaps tapping
into underground source of water.

trees curve around from the south to the east, effectively deterring

daisies and dandelions are the only disruption amidst the swathes of
grass their yellow buds swaying as each gust of wind whips at their

both northwards and to the south along a tall trellis.  A small sun-dried

Roughly fifteen feet from the ground, this branch seems to be the only
one capable of holding any weight beyond that of a squirrel. From this vantage
point, the entire forest can be seen, stretching off to the north and
west.  Knee-high grass with an occasional tree completes the view of the
