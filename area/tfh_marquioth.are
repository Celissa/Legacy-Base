Before an Obsidian Gateway~
After the noise and bustle of Sha'kymor'al just a few feet overhead, this
elegant chamber seems almost utterly silent.  The whole area is decorated
in ebony, a blackness so deep as to rival the most starless of midnights. 
Lanterns are mounted every few feet along the wall, each covered with a
translucent shield of red-colored material, leaving crimson light to pool
on the polished obsidian floor like blood.  Here and there, the lanterns'
ruby-colored light catches the gleam of gold from the decorations inlaid
upon the walls of ebony wood.  To the west, a pair of colossal slabs of
intricately carved obsidian serves as a gateway into the heart of the
mountain.

gate colossal slab obsidian~
These massive blocks of obsidian stand over ten feet in height, dwarfing
anyone passing through their dark embrace.  An intricate filigree of
silver inlay draws patterns of spiderwebs over the silky-smooth black
stone, with tiny spiders formed of rubies positioned here and there along
the maze of silver threads.  An arch of cold, polished black stone towers
above the gates, its surface gleaming with gold and silver decorations.
~
E
lanterns~
In the Realm of Shadows, no expense is spared towards making this haven
of luxury ever more beautiful and sensuous.  Even the wall-mountings of
the lanterns are made of pure, beaten gold, while the translucent shields
of ruby-red surrounding their dancing flames give the whole area a
lovely, if somewhat unsettling, effect.

Richly Decorated Corridor~
Finely woven rugs cushion every footfall from the cold, dark stone of the
floor here.  A few softly glowing mage-lights offer muted illumination,
cloaking the room in dancing shadows.  Heavy tapestries of silk line the
walls of the chamber, their deep colors adding to the overall feeling of
darkness this place radiates.  The walls behind the tapestries are built
from rounded chunks of stone, insulating this corridor from the raucous
noise of Sha'kymor'al.  A subtle, heady scent of some exotic spice
lingers in the air, though you can't be sure of its source.

Richly Decorated Corridor~
In striking contrast to the city just outside the heavy door to the east,
this place is spotlessly clean, as if no trace of dust and grime would
dare to invade so elegant a chamber.  A pair of gold-plated incense
braziers stands on either side of the doorway, filling the air with a
soft haze of smoke and a subtle scent reminiscent of jasmine and exotic
spices.  The area's faint illumination come from a few globes of
mage-light floating high along the walls.  Rugs tinted a deep crimson hue
carpet the hallway, their thick, luxurious softness making it almost seem
like one was walking on air instead of a cold stone floor.  The beautiful
silk tapestries lining the walls gleam here and there with the glint of
silver and golden embroidery.

The heavy golden braziers stand about three and a half feet in height. 
The pedestals upon which they rest are plated with the same precious
metal, their exquisite designs shimmering in the soft ambient
illumination.  Intricate carvings of knotwork patterns cover almost every
surface of the gleaming metal, detailed, but not overtly eye-catching. 
Twining wisps of blue-grey smoke drift lazily from the braziers, adding
their understated fragrances of jasmine and sweet spices to the air.
~
E
silk tapestries~
Luscious tapestries of heavy raw silk line the dark stone walls,
insulating the hallway in a veil of shimmering color.  Vibrant crimsons,
sapphirine tones, verdant greens, and velvety purples meld together into
a riot of tasteful hues.  The silk is embroidered lightly with subtle
designs woven in threads of spun silver and gold, adding a metallic glint
to the soft fabric.

Richly Decorated Corridor~
Luxuriant curtains of fine silks have been hung along both sides of this
elegant corridor, the deep jewel tones of which they are woven gleaming
here and there with a touch of gold and silver embroidery.  To either
side of the heavy wooden door just to the west stands a golden incense
brazier, from which the subtle scents of jasmine and sweet-smelling
spices rise.  Crimson rugs, soft as velvet, line the floor of polished,
dark grey stone, cushioning each step.  The many noises of the bustling
city just beyond the door are muted, blocked away by the thick stone
walls of this chamber.  The room is cloaked in the swirling patterns of
light and shadow cast by the few globes of dancing light hovering near
the hallway's vaulted ceiling.

Gossamer layers of finest silk drape the dark stone walls in a shimmer of

their pedestals, wrapping the honey-colored metal with intricate knotwork
designs.

Guard Post~
The rough granite walls of Sha'kymor'al stretch to the west and south,
looming high above any passer-by.  A few strategically placed arrow-slits
line each towering wall, offering a place to attack in the event of a
siege.  A sheltered nook on the western wall proves to hold a fire-pit,
in which a small blaze burns constantly.  The only concession to beauty
in this rather militant area is the smooth stone arches leading to the
north and east, elegant in their very simplicity.

A merry little blaze flickers in the carefully sheltered nook, giving the

years past.

Inside the Western Gate of Sha'kymor'al~
The many noises common to any busy port city reach the ears of any
traveler entering this place; the entreaties of shopkeepers vending their
wares, the cries of children dashing through the streets, and the general
bustle of many people all going about their business ring through the air
no matter what the hour.  Rough-hewn stones pave the road in uneven
cobblestones, varying in color from dark grey to a reddish brown tint. 
Smooth arches of grey granite lead to what appear to be guard posts to
the north and south, while Al'liani Street winds off to the east.  The
view to the west is dominated by an imposing gate of heavy steel,
complete with a nasty looking portcullis which could be dropped in case
of invasion.

The massive gate looms high above the heads of any passers-by, its heavy
steel frame inspiring, perhaps, a touch of awe.  A well-maintained
portcullis, kept carefully free of any damage from the elements, rests
almost lazily overhead, its sharp spikes gleaming menacingly.  Even this
is not without its touch of beauty, however, for the latticework of the
portcullis is engraved with designs of weaponry and legendary predators
such as dragons and griffons, beautifully wrought upon the dark colored
steel.

E
arches stone smooth~
Light grey granite, so pale as to appear almost white, forms a pair of
smooth, simple arches decorating the entranceways to the north and south. 
No designs or statuary adorn the arches; rather, their very lack of
embellishments adds to the elegant grace of the structures.

Guard Post~
This small building is made of rough granite stones, giving the room a
damp chill that never seems to quite be dispelled.  Dark blocks of the
same stone pave the floor, only partially covered by a heavy bearskin rug. 
A weak blaze burns in a pit towards the back of this shelter, its hazy
reddish glow doing little except to provide the place with a bit of light. 
Along one wall stands a rack of gleaming weapons, the iron and steel of
which they are crafted shining menacingly in the red-orange glow of the
fire.

bearskin rug~
Made of the tanned hide of a very large bear, this rug covers a good
portion of the floor.  The soft black fur glistens a bit in the
firelight, the individual hairs upon it sometimes glinting with a touch
of crimson.  The head of the beast is still attached, its mouth open wide
to expose a mouthful of gruesomely sharp fangs.
~
E
weapons rack~
A simple, yet effective wooden rack holds all manner of weaponry. 
Razor-sharp blades gleam expectantly, their edges honed carefully to
slice through almost anything with ease.  Spiked clubs and morningstars
rest casually in the rack, their grips worn smooth by constant usage.  A
few wickedly recurved bows hang just above the rack, quivers full of
arrows immediately at hand beside them.

Al'liani Street~
The dusty cobblestones of Al'liani Street stretch out to the east.  Just
to the west, a colossal portcullis of dark steel gleams menacingly in the
ambient light.  The stones paving the road, worn smooth by the passage of
many feet, make up an elaborate mosaic of random patterns, ranging in
color from a deep reddish brown to a dusky grey tone.  A wall of very
dark, almost black, stones rises to the south, the smoothly rounded
chunks fitting together almost seamlessly.  The multitude of noises of
any busy city ring constantly through the salt-tinged air, echoing down
the narrow streets.

Dancing patterns of colored stones weave their patterns across the busy
street.  Though their surfaces are worn and obscured by the dirt and
grime of many passing feet, splashes of brilliant color stand out against
the dust in places: here a bit of deep red, there a touch of golden
yellow, and there again patches of dusky blue-grey.  The patterns that
roll across the street are random, but at times it almost seems as if
there were other, more expansive designs interwoven with the simple
patches of colored stone.

Intersection of Zhanal Road and Al'liani Street~
The cobbled paths of Al'liani Street and Zhanal Road intersect here,
offering the pedestrian a choice of paths.  A finely-crafted wall of dark
stone rises to the south, preventing travel in that direction.  To the
north, the doors of many small shops and businesses can be seen.  Signs
hang above the doors to provide one with information about the shop.  To
the east is more roadway, a small building ending the road further down. 
Along the southern wall, a few stray flowers lift their heads bravely to
the skies.

Al'liani Street~
The cobbled way of Al'liani Street continues east and west, minor
intersections visible in both directions.  The dark black of the city
wall rises up to the south.  A short wall of stone rises up to the north,
and a lush carpet of green is visible through small cracks between the
stones.  Moss and frail-seeming ivy grow along the stones, covering it in
a gray-green layer of foliage.  The mortar holding the stones together is
either old or poorly mixed; it is disintegrating in many places and is
completely gone in others.

The wall stands at perhaps waist-height on an average sized human, made
of large chunks of fragile grey stone.  Crumbling mortar partially holds
the old stones in their respective places, leaving gaps through which one
can spy the small garden along the other side of the wall.  Here and
there, a stone has fallen from its place, sagging wearily against the old
stone barrier.

E
ivy moss~
A profusion of greenery cascades down both sides of the small stone wall. 
Wispy tendrils of ivy stretch tentative fingers of growth through cracks
between the stones, their deep emerald tones adding a hint of lovely
color to the otherwise blase stone.  Around the base of the wall,
nourished by its shade, clumps of thick moss grow heavily, forming a
natural carpeting.  Intertwined with the stems of ivy, a single
honeysuckle vine grows, its fragrant yellow blossoms inviting passers-by
to pause for a moment and enjoy the sweetness of life.

Zhanal Road~
This short by-street acts as a link between Al'liani street and the town
square.  The cobbled streets are rough, and relatively clean, as though
this area is not heavily traveled.  A squalid building of rough boards
has been erected on the west side of the road.  Very faint traces of a
sickly stench drift from the half-open door of the hovel.  The sounds of
a busy town square drift over from the north east.

A Dimly-Lit Hovel~
This room seems cloaked in shadows so heavy that even the strongest of
lights melts into faded pools of illumination.  A faint, sickly stench
hangs in the still air, smelling of dried sweat and dirty leather.  The
floor, made simply of packed earth, shows traces of recent footsteps
entering and leaving this squalid hovel.  A small table, battered and
leaning heavily against the wall, stands in one dark corner of the room,
with one very unsteady-looking chair wobbling beside it.  A heaping pile
of rags and tattered bits and pieces of cloth and leather lies abandoned
in the other corner.  The faintest rustling noises seem to emanate from
the heap, as if something underneath it all was moving.

Zhanal Road~
This part of Zhanal Road intersects not with another road, but with a
couple of courtyards.  To the east, the worn cobblestones lead into the
bustling town square, and further on can be heard the light trickle of
water, beneath the noise of Sha'kymor'al.  To the west, the cobblestones
weave into a courtyard scattered with rubble and other debris, which by
the look of it, seems to be avoided by most of the townsfolk that pass by.

A Rubble-Strewn Courtyard~
This courtyard, though large, seems quite crowded.  A disorganized pile
of broken and charred wood is stacked haphazardly at the southern end, a
wagon wheel visible among the wreckage.  Almost matching the destruction,
on the opposite side the walls are charred and blackened, chunks of stone
missing and a tangled mess of wood which looks like it has been there for
a while.  Indeed, the only area which looks safe to traverse is the
center of the courtyard, a path cleared from east to west.

A Quiet, Well-Lit Chamber~
This quiet, tidy chamber contrasts strongly to the destruction and mess
of the courtyard passed through to reach it.  Looking quite orderly, with
smooth walls of dark stone and a simple curving archway for an entrance,
the chamber is relatively barren apart from a series of barred windows to
the west end of it.  Behind the windows can be seen many vyans wearing
tidy clothing and carrying parchments and quill pens, frantically
scribing away.

Zhanal Road~
Zhanal Road reaches an end here, its winding cobblestones ending at a
wall between two solid-looking buildings made of stone.  To the east, a
door of rough wooden planks leads into a tiny shop, a banner above the
door proclaiming its name.  Likewise, to the other side, a hanging sign
above the solid oaken door gives away the details of what lies within.

The Silver Blade~
A haze of bluish tinted smoke hangs heavy in the air, coloring everything
with a faint grey tinge.  The room is quite dark, lit only by a couple of
feebly flickering lanterns hanging wearily from the northern wall. 
Though the encroaching darkness makes the walls seem to loom close from
any angle, the area is actually quite a bit larger than it appears. 
Somewhere in the vicinity, meat must be cooking, judging by the sounds of
crackling flesh, though the odors of cooking are barely discernable
through the stench of unwashed bodies and cheap malt liquor.  Several
tables stand wobbling drunkenly throughout the area, looking almost as
unsteady on their feet as many of the patrons of this shoddy tavern.

The Silver Blade~
One of the first things that draws the eye in this darkened, hazy room is
a long counter of deep brown wood stretching along the northern wall. 
It's obviously seen better days; its once smoothly polished surfaces are
now dented and scratched to the point of irrepairability.  A row of tall
stools trails along the edge of the bar, their condition not looking much
better than that of the counter-top.  Behind the bar, several tapped
casks of cheap liquor are stacked up, waiting, no doubt, for the next
order.  A firepit stands on the western side of the room, with a spit
stretched over it, continually roasting up something or other, though
what exactly it might be is better left to the imagination.  The
flickering flames dance eerily, throwing pools of light and shadow
to dance randomly throughout the area.

A ring of rough chunks of rock, each painted a brilliant scarlet,
outlines the firepit, giving even the most inebriated of the tavern's
patrons a clear warning to keep away.  Tongues of flame lick hungrily at
a barely seared chunk of unidentifiable meat hanging precariously from a
spit over the pit.  Every now and then, a drop of blood crackles as it
falls deep into the glowing coals.
~
E
casks~
Several old wooden casks, each stained in shades of brown, stand tapped
and ready for the next round of ale behind the counter.  The pungent reek
of malt liquor hangs heavily in the still, smoky air, combining with the
scent of roasting flesh to create a none too pleasant stench.

Distinctive Custom Gems~
This shop is tiny, barely able to contain what few items it does.  A
glass-covered display sits up against the north wall, and a work bench is
against the back wall.  There is a stool near the bench, and several
small metalworker's tools have been left about.  A small window is set in
the west wall; the pane consists of tiny circles of translucent glass
held together with hand-worked lead.

Looking over the Edge of the World~
This small cafe has been built up in a large niche in the face of the
cliff.  A rickety wrought-iron fence is the only thing between the cafe
and a fall to certain death, and it shows signs of rust.  Four tables of
thick wood have been set about on the stone floor, a few rickety chairs
pulled up to each.  A taut awning of coarse linen reaches overhead,
protecting this little nook from most of the elements.  A bar has been
built up against the back wall of this crevice, its top stained from
multitudes of spilled drinks.  The air is filled with the tangy scent of
the ocean, and a constant light mist keeps this sheltered alcove cool
even on the hottest days of summer.  From just off the balcony, a winding
trail leads back up the cliffside to the city.

rickety wrought-iron fence~
This small fence only rises a foot and a half off the stone floor, held
not so firmly in place with two rusted bolts at each upright post.  What
once may have been finely-wrought iron is now rather red with rust, and
the metal has begun to flake away in places.
~
E
tables chairs~
These tables are mostly square; the angles aren't quite right and the
edges aren't pefectly straight.  Constructed of thick planks of wood but
not finished, they show signs of heavy use: food stains, deep scratches
and small chunks missing.  The chairs, which are of similar construction,
look at least sturdy enough to sit on for half an hour.
~
E
taut awning coarse linen ceiling overhead~
The stripes of this awning may once have been black and white, but are
now grey and grey - albeit dark and light.  Although faded and weathered,
it still appears to be in good condition structurally, with only minor
holes around the edges and none in the middle.
~
E
bar~
Constructed of dark wood, this bar looks as though it was recently built
-- perhaps as a replacement of the original.  Dark, sticky stains cover
the surface of the battered bar, and small fuzzy bits of something have
stuck to it.  A pair of empty bottles sit on the end, candles burned down
in their mouths.

Rocky Shore at the Base of the Cliff~
The ocean crashes angrily against the rocky shore here, the frothy,
white-capped waves receding quickly, creating what could well be a nasty
riptide.  The rocks littering the beach are extremely jagged, and several
of them sit vertically, sharp edges towards the sky.  Stacked several
feet high in some place, the rocks completely cover the sand in a solid
carpet.  Small spots stain the rocks, perhaps the blood of some other
poor soul who fell from the cliff above.

Town Square~
The cobbled stones on this side of the town square are bare and barren. 
Zhanal Road begins to the west, winding its way to the clanking gate.  A
few half-barrels, filled with soil and bright flowers, have been lined up
against the wall to the north, lending a splash of color to the otherwise
drab vicinity.  Bits of earthen soil have been strewn about the ground
here, as if small hands have pulled it from the barrel and dropped it.

as if the only water the flowers get is what the wind blows in from the
nearby fountain, and what they manage to capture from the rain.

Town Square~
The town square here is wide, perhaps the largest open area in the city. 
The loosely-patterned cobblestones in this area are worn smooth, from
years of countless feet approaching the fountain to slake their thirst. 
The fountain itself is rather simple in design, carved of granite with a
wide, circular rim at its base, which could serve as a crude bench to sit
on.  At the centre of the fountain is the statue of a gruesome looking
gargoyle, its bat-like wings outstretched for flight, water pouring out
of an outstretched mouth rimmed with sharp looking stony teeth.  It looks
as though there might be a couple coins in the pool of water.

Clearly visible in the shimmering waters of the pool at the base of the

Town Square~
The cobbled stones of the town square give way to clover and grass in
what seems to be a small park in the town square.  This secluded corner
has short walls of stone rising up to the south and the west, providing a
quiet corner, complete with stone benches, to contemplate or just relax. 
Ivy grows up over the stone walls, and dandelions and daisies pop up from
between the green carpet on the ground.

Town Square~
Dominating the southern end of the town square, a tall and proud oak tree
towers over the area.  The large leafy branches stretch outwards over the
cobbled stones of the courtyard, looking as if they would provide ample
shade during the daylight hours.  The thick trunk of the mighty oak is
knotted and twisted, both strong indicators of the ripe age of the tree. 
Beneath the murmuring whisper of the leaves blowing in the wind, can be
heard the trickle of water, which seems to be coming from nearby.

Al'liani Street~
The street wanders gently towards the north, leading into the bustling
town square.  Patches of dirt and grass prevail over the cobblestones in
some areas of the road, heavily invaded by thick clumps of weeds.  The
soothing sounds of a trickling fountain and the warbling songs of birds
mix with the raucous laughter of children at play and the incessant cries
of the merchants always seeking a copper to line their pockets.  A
colossal oak tree spreads its leafy branches overhead, providing a
pleasantly shaded walkway.  The gnarled roots of the tree poke up quite a
ways in some places, the wind-smoothed burls giving children a perfect
spot to sit and play.

dirt grass weeds patches clumps~
Close around the base of the tree, patches of grass and weeds overrun the
orderly cobbles paving the street.  The blades of grass are withered and
brown in color, looking somewhat choked by the heavy influx of weeds. 
The nettles and other various undesirables, in contrast, seem to be
growing quite nicely, raising their razor-edged leaves towards the sky. 
Every now and then, a glimmer of light catches the eye from in the midst
of one of the most dense clumps of weeds.

E
tree oak~
This oak tree is a giant of its species, its girth far too large for even
an ogre or troll to reach around.  The craggy bark of the ancient tree
has been carved into in many places with words of undying love that have
likely lasted much longer than the sentiments they once stood for.

Guard Post~
Walls of cold, unyielding granite stretch high above the heads of any
passers-by.  High along the walls, dark lines of shadow denote
arrow-slits from which skilled archers could defend the city in case of a
siege.  Towering arches of simple, yet beautifully cut stone lead off to
the north and east, while to the west is a heavy door of polished
ironwood.  The floor is paved with cobblestones of various colors, the
random patterns of greys, reds and yellows providing a touch of
aestheticism to the otherwise rather unimaginative area.  A splash of
deep crimson lies sullenly across one lower corner of the southern wall.

Intersection of Al'liani Street and Nissel Avenue~
One end of Al'liani Street is here, creating a T intersection with Nissel
Avenue.  The cobblestones underfoot have been worn nearly smooth,
implying that this is an oft-traveled section of roadway.  A sign hangs
over the doorway to the east, and along with the faint smell of new
leather, provides a clue as to what lies beyond the threshold.  The
bustling of the town square can still be heard to the north.

Inside the Southern Gate of Sha'kymor'al Outpost~
A nasty steel portcullis has been set into the thick stone wall, its
bottom spikes gleaming dully.  Built onto the outer wall is a small guard
post, looking as though it would house two or three.  Cobbled roads
stretch out from this point; Khalifa Way is just to the east while the
intersection of Al'liani Street and Nissel Avenue lies to the north. 
Sounds of all sorts assail this area: Drunken voices from taverns, the
haggling of merchants, the calls and shrieks of children, and dozens of
other, softer noises.

Road To Sha'kymor'al~
Northwards the roadway opens into a bustling township, vyan traders and
common foke going about their day to day lives under the shadow of the
mountain.  Purple-hued crystals provide an ambiant light for the town,
enough for the sharp eyed vyan to see by but a strain for any surface
race.  The road to the east ends in a stone gate enabling travlers to
continue their journey through the dark passages.

Khalifa Way~
The cobbled stones underfoot have been worn smooth by countless passing
feet.  Both road and gutter are filthy, covered in an unidentifiable mess
of dirt and other materials.  A little further to the east, a dark,
wooden building rises up at the side of the road.  The smells and sounds
emanating from it identify it fairly clearly as a tavern.  Not much
further to the west is the south gate of the city.

Khalifa Way~
The road curves here, making way for what appears to be a tavern. 
Accumulations of filth line the gutters nearby, unidentifiable bits of
things coming together to create a rather unpleasant smell.  The tavern's
walls are made of dark wood planks, worn smooth over time by the elements. 
A pair of windows flank the door in the near face of the building, their
shutters hanging a little crookedly.  An archway in the east wall frames
a door of thick-planked wood, a roughly forged iron handle jutting from
its left side.  Hanging overtop of the door is a swinging wooden sign,
its hinges creaking slightly.

The road continues along, bending to allow for a stone building that has
been put up to the north.  It has been solidly constructed, of carefully
planed boards and wood-capped nails.  A single window accents the front
of the building, a tiny wooden box on the sill holding bright flowers.  A
sign hangs above the well-crafted door.  The smells and sounds of a busy

other side of the room, a new flatiron resting on the end.  A small
fireplace has been built next to where the ironing board is, and there
are a couple logs resting in a bronze holder nearby.  Several baskets of
fine fabrics rest in the back corner, and a small shelf on the wall is
home to several bolts of material.

A building directly to the south causes Khalifa Way to bend.  Light

is speckled with weeds and wildflowers, and doesn't seem to be regularly

The Bitter Moon~
The flames of a hundred candles dance at the caress of an ever-present
breeze much as a cobra will sway to the melody of a snake-charmer. 
Reflected in small panels of highly polished metal which hang along the
walls, the dancing tongues of flame fill the air with splintered rainbows
of refracted light.  Heavy rugs of deep crimson fabric line the cold
stone floors, cushioning each footstep in a nest of soft cloth.  Scarlet
tapestries cover the walls in a blaze of color, though the edges of the
material look to be a bit frayed.  The gleam of shining metal entrances
the eye everywhere in this gaudy room, but its sheen is more that of
carefully polished brass than the pure lustre of gold.  Raucous music
swirls through the perfume-laden atmosphere, enticing any passers-by to
stop and join in the merriment.

Though this area is by no means small, the constant press of humanity
makes the room seem almost stifling.  Several tables form a somewhat
lopsided half-circle around a small stage in one corner, each surrounded
by quite a few individuals of many races.  Flickering candlelight
provides plenty of illumination, filling the room with golden light.  The
air is laden with the heady scent of perfume, jasmine, rose and other
floral aromas mingling in an overwhelming mixture of scents that surely
nature never intended.  The colors of scarlet and gold assault the eye
with their overpowering brilliance, indeed, everything down to the wood
of the tables and chairs seems to be finished with a crimson hue. 
Gleaming adornments of polished metal decorate almost everything, though
the color is more of brass than gold.

sense of jubilance and festivity.  The tiny flames are reflected a
hundred times over in the myriad of little metal plates decorating
virtually every surface, burnishing the brassy metal with the lustre of
golden fire.  Sweet scents of floral perfumes hang heavily in the air,
though the clash of different fragrances is at times overwhelming.  The

A swirl of color and light dominates the view just over the stone
baulstrade running along the edge of the balcony.  The candle flames seem
to dance just in time with the everpresent cacaphony of music and the
voices of the crowd populating the tavern below.  It is darker here, the
brilliant candle flames melting into the obscurity of pooled shadows
lining the amber-gold walls.  The wild red and brassy gold tones of the
room below are more muted here, crimsons fading into sullen scarlets, and
the flashy brass hues burnished to a more subtle honey color.  Narrow
wooden stairs spiral down to the floor below, the heavily scuffed
surfaces of each step showing signs of the passage of many feet.  Over
the main room, a beautiful chandelier made of cut glass sways
provocatively, sending a never-ending kaleidoscope of reflected light
cascading over the area.

This small courtyard is framed by a stone wall that looks to be about

the door in the tavern building.  The rest of the ground is covered in
sparse, unkempt grass, a few stray dandelions poking their yellow heads
up between the razor-edged leaves of wild weeds.  Somebody has made an
effort to beautify this small space; there are little stands of bright
wildflowers in pebble-ringed clumps all over the grass.  A bronze-bound
barrel stands at the corner of the building, collecting runoff from the
leaky eaves.  A sign swings back and forth above the door.

also in centre of the vast warehouse, creating aisles down the interior. 
Many of the containers are battered and travel-stained, having seen many
long weeks on the road.  Tucked away in one pokey corner, a cluttered
desk gathers dust, documents and other assorted miscellanea.  A chair,
sitting nearby, seems more like an extension to the desk, folders and
papers stacked precariously on the hard wooden seat.

Inside the Eastern Gate of Sha'kymor'al~
A nasty steel portcullis has been set into the thick stone wall, its
bottom spikes gleaming dully.  Built onto the outer wall is a small
guard post, looking as though it would house two or three.  Cobbled roads
stretch out from this point, the intersection of Khalifa Way and Shyleza
Road is just to the west, and what appears to be a walled courtyard lies
to the south.  The sounds of drunken laughter and conversation seem to
emanate from that direction, the smell of fine ale carried with it on the
breeze.

A colossal gate of dark steel stands deterrant to any wishing to make
unauthorized entry to the Realm of Shadows.  The portcullis and gate
mechanisms have been carefully kept free from the wanton destruction of
the elements, the moving parts of the apparatus scarely making more sound
than a whisper upon their opening.  Fanciful designs of the exotic
predators of legend dance upon the backdrop of dark steel, mingled with
designs of elaborate weaponry.

Guard Post~
The rough granite walls of Sha'kymor'al stretch out to the west, looking
high above any passer-by.  Several crossletted arrowslits face eastwards,
out towards the pathways leading into Mar Quioth and whatever danger
might come from that direction.  Set into the western side of the
chamber, a softly burning fire-pit blazes, providing warmth to the guards
on their long watches.  To the south, an elegant looking archway guards
the entrance, the barbed spikes of a raised portcullis only just visible
peeking out of the stone.

Sinuous tongues of flame seethe within the small basin built into the

base of the brasier, the crimson embers seeming unwilling to give up
their last sparks of life and warmth.

Shyleza Road~
The cobbled road continues along here, stretching east past an
intersection to a gate, and west towards the city square.  The gutters at
the sides of the road are fairly clean; only a single leaf of paper lies
therein.  Rising to the south is the wall of a sturdily-made building,
its back face providing no clue as to what it contains.  North of here is
what appears to be an abandoned house, the door closed and windows
boarded over.

Abandoned Home~
This building might have been a home at one point, but now it's just an
empty house.  There are dark areas on the wall where pictures used to
hang, and the floor is a patchwork of color, as if there were rugs on the
floor that were constantly being moved around.  Dust has gathered in the
corners, and the breeze blows through the cracks in the window shutters
in the front wall, occasionally stirring it up.

A Dark, Dank Cellar~
This dark and dank cellar lies beneath the rotting floorboards of the
room above; a dim light filters down through cracks that have formed
between the warping planks.  Dust and dirt flitter around the room,
stirred from their resting places by the slight air currents that waft in
from outside.  The dust is barely visible, mere particles that move
through the shafts of light coming from overhead.  There is a small hatch
outlined in the planking above, at the top of the tied rope ladder.

Shyleza Road~
Flanked by buildings on both sides, Shyleza Road extends both east and
west, intersections not too far away on either end.  A few weeds are
noticable poking up between the loosely patterned cobblestones of the
street, which cover the majority of this area.  The building to the north
of the road has a hitching post erected outside its door, as if it is a
popular stop for travellers in these parts.

Margrove's Supplies~
This cluttered store looks as if it might be rather difficult to navigate. 
The walls are stacked high with roughly cut oaken shelves, which are in
turn stacked and filled with boxes, bags, and barrels containing a
miscellany of items.  As for the floorspace, there seems very little room
to maneuver, as the centre of the room has a large pile of sacks in it,
the only cleared floorspace being a narrow path from each door to the
rough oaken counter in the northeast corner of the chamber.

Filling the oaken shelves, from the floor to the ceiling are a large
number of wooden boxes, crates, bags, and small barrels.  The barrels
seem to be filled mostly with fruit, but a few to be filled with nails
and long iron spikes.  As for the boxes, they seem to contain tools, such
as hammers, coils of rope and cord, and simple weapons.  From the look
and smell of the bags, they seem to contain aging cheeses and breads.

E
sacks~
The pile of sacks in the centre of the room seems quite large, but it
looks as if most of the sacks are empty, almost as if they are just
thrown there after their contents are places on the shelves.  A faint
glimmer of something metal seems visible in the center of the pile.
~
E
counter~
The oaken counter, much like the shelves, is very roughtly cut.  as if it
was only built to serve a purpose, and not at all for aesthetic reasons. 
Behind the counter sits a cushioned oaken footstool, and a tall
stepladder, presumably for reaching the taller shelves.

Tawny's Weaponry~
The room is fairly empty, save for racks of every type of weapon
imaginable standing here and there against the walls.  Mirrored panels
line the walls, stretching nearly from the low ceiling all the way down
to the floor, giving anyone practicing in this arena a good view of their
workout.  A few training dummies positioned in the center of the floor
provide the only distraction in the otherwise tedious vista of musty
tanbark and mirrored reflections.  The floor is covered over with chips
of wood and bark, the woodsy aroma of the mixture hanging thick in the
sawdust-laden air of the salle.  Just inside the doorway to the north
stands a counter upon which a few of the many varieties of weapons this
place has to offer are displayed.

Nissel Avenue~
The street continues underfoot, but expands outward into a cobbled square
to the west.  The cobblestones have been worn smooth by countless feet
treading over them, and stained by all matter of unidentifiable material. 
Rising up to the east, the stone wall of the building towers over the
road.  Set into it, a window shuttered with oaken boards provides a
little insight as to what lies within.

Intersection of Nissel Avenue and Shyleza Road~
One end of Shyleza Road extends to the east of here, for in the opposite
direction lies the bustling city square.  Its cobbled stones meet with
Nissel Avenue, stretching out in both directions as far as the eye can
see down its busy pathways.  The cobblestones in this part of the city
look to be very well worn, most likely due to the close proximity of the
fountain.

Strewn across the floor, a malodorous layer of straw, in dire need of

to the walls to provide some storage space for riding gear, and a few
pieces of equipment used by blacksmiths.

Dusty Trail Along A Cliff~
This well-worn footpath leads away from the city proper towards the edge
of a towering cliff.  Stunted, sickly flowers line the path, their petals
covered with the dust kicked up by passing feet.  A few blades of grass
poke up along either side of the trail, but for the most part the ground
is pebbled and dusty.  Not too much farther north is the abrupt ending of
the cliff.

Looking over the Edge of the World~
A steep vertical drop puts an end to the trail.  The edge of the cliff
gives way to...  nothing.  The face of the rock descends countless
thousands of meters down to the invisible ground below.  The grass grows
a little more abundantly here, but the blades are still coated in dust. 
The relative safety city of Mar Quioth lies back to the south, well away
from the perilous precipice.  A small, dusty trail leads up to the very
edge of the cliff, almost looking as though it might lead down the face.

small dusty trail edge face down~
This small trail is simply a worn spot where no grass grows.  It runs to
the extreme end of the cliff, the nearby edge very crumbly and rounded. 
The bottom of the cliff looks to be at least a thousand feet down.

A Dark, Enclosed Storage Room~
Wine casks, ale barrels and dusty shelves line this room, which is
obviously this establishment's storage area.  The footprints of various
small rodents streak across the dust on the floor, concentrated more
strongly in the corner of the room where food might have once been kept. 
Three large barrels sit in a pyramid in the middle of the room.

An Out-of-the-way Alcove~
After the revel of light and color below, this small alcove seems almost
boring.  The brilliant hues of the lower level of the building are not
present here; instead, the room is decorated tastefully in deep midnight
blues and subtle silver highlights.  Several pieces of furniture are
scattered throughout the room, made of a luscious dark colored wood.  A
few candles flicker behind shades of cobalt-blue frosted glass, leaving
pools of soft illumination spilling onto the floor.  Luxuriant rugs woven
of a variety of soft blue hues line the wooden floor, covering the
unyielding wood with the plush pliability of thick, dulcet carpeting.

furniture~
A few heavy pieces of deep, almost ebony, wood are scattered tastefully
about the room.  Against one wall stands a low table, adorned by a lacy
cloth, in front of a moderately sized mirror of silver polished to a high
sheen.  On the opposite wall, a beautifully carved four poster bed
stands, looking lush and inviting, with several thick feather mattresses
and a soft, downy coverlet of deep sapphirine.  At the foot of the bed, a
carefully embroidered blanket has been tossed across..something, as
though someone was trying to conceal what lies beneath.  The third wall
holds an armoire of rosewood, carved to match the patterns of the bed and
vanity table.
~
E
table lacy~
A dainty little stool stands just before the table, its lacy covering
delicately embroidered with threads of blue and silver hues.  Upon the
vanity table itself, a vast array of face paints and cosmetics can be
found in a sort of semi-organized disarray.  Several corked glass bottles
of fragrance lie scattered throughout the tangle of cosmetics.  A light
scent of jasmine hangs cloyingly in the air, its source a single bottle
of perfume which seems to have lost its sealing cork.
~
E
rosewood armoire~
This pretty clothes press stands a bit over six feet in height.  Dainty
carved patterns adorn the length and bredth of the glossy rosewood.  A
pair of delicate silver handles are set upon the front of the cabinet,
their purpose seeming as much adornment as utility.
~
E
silver polished mirror~
A moderately sized mirror of silver, polished to a high sheen, hangs from
one wall of this room.  It is made from a dark, luscious, and rich wood
carved with intricate details.  A pattern of runed etching, highlighted
with a silver paint, inscribes the edge of the mirror.  A low table,
adorned by a lacy cloth sits directly in front of the mirror.

Luxuriant rugs woven of a variety of soft blue hued silks cover the

Descent Into Darkness~
Spiraling steps of polished ebony stone lead deep into the cold embrace
of the darkness below.  Sha'kymor'al is just a few feet overhead, but the
heavy stone insulates most of the noise from the busy streets, leaving
this place with only a faint echo of the clamor above.  Only a few
lanterns shed their light on these steep stairs, leaving patches of
intense blackness between the pools of light.  At the bottom of the
stairway, a strange, ruby-colored glow pulses, looking for all the world
like the beating of a heart.  From this point, one can either head
downwards towards the gates of Sha'rheza, or flee the all-encompassing
darkness of the Realm of Shadows, hoping to escape towards the sun-lit
realms.

Even the warm light shed by these few lanterns looks wan and pale when
surrounded by this infinite blackness.  As the steps continue ever
downward, the lanterns' brackets grow more and more elegant, ranging from
simple iron near the top to intricate designs of silver that are as much
decoration as a source of light.

Overlooking the Center of Sha'kymor'al~
A curtain of dense emerald-hued leaves forms a veil between this secluded
haven and the bustling town square below.  The enveloping arms of
greenery mute the chaos below a little, making this spot an excellent
place for relaxation..or hiding.  Many birds have made their homes along
the tree's branches, leaving bits of twigs, twine, fur and feathers
lingering all over the place.  A convergence of two large branches
provides a good seat for any wishing to merely observe the passage of
those below.  Just a little higher up the trunk, a squirrel has made a
nest.  A few clusters of acorns dangle just barely within reach.

Beneath the Armory - A Sweltering Forge~
Waves of head radiate around the room the flames of the forge sending
rippling patterns across the walls.  Tools for metal smithing lie stacked
in semi-random piles ready for an ogre or troll to begin work on the next
bit of armor.  Smoke drifts upwards from the room, enabling the air here
to be a touch clearer.

Beneath the Armory - A Sweltering Forge~
An intense heat washes over you as you enter this part of the armory. 
Here, you can that all of the major metal working tasks are done here. 
Lying in neat stacks next to the anvil are plates of various kidns of
metals.  The forge itself is huge, and the heat eminating from it is
quite intesnse.  Sitting in the middle of the room is a large anvil, and
standing beside it hard at work is a large, sweaty orc.

Gates of Sha'kymor'al Outpost~
Gates of iron and stone rise to the east, their surface coated in
spiderweb designs and framed by snaking writing.  The roadway leads from
the mighty gates and westwards along a well maintained road, a few
purple-hued lightstones casting pale light upon the path.  The sounds of
a bustling township echoes from the west the mutted cries of traders
heard above the general mummer of people.
