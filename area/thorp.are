Beyond the Mighty Oaks~
The trees encroach upon the clearing from the both sides, thick walls of
bark and leaves preventing all passage.  Dominated by a pair of huge oaks
at its southern end, this grassy clearing in the woods looks as if it has
been undisturbed for years uncounted, although there are the recent
telltale signs of travelers passing through these parts.  Clusters of
@Wdaisies@n peek out from amongst the rampant clover and short grasses, a
smattering of white against the verdant greenery.

Mouth of a Tree-Lined Valley~
Small birds can be heard chirping in the boughs above as the clearing
disappears into a lightly forested woodland.  A lattice of mossy green
rootwork criss-crosses the ground, a light covering of grass blanketing
the ground to match it.  The trees here are aged and tall, as if they
have rested here undisturbed for untold years.

By the Mouth of a Tree-Lined Valley~
The light is dim here, and the mossy ground is damp with moisture.  The
high branches of the heavily wooded forest to the west and south encroach
upon the sky, blocking out much of the light.  Out in the thick
undergrowth, the forest is filled with life, deer and fox visible but not
reachable due to the heavy tree cover and thorny bushes.  The growth of
infant tree seedlings can be seen peeking out through the moss, an
attempt at new life in this dank section of the forest.

Beneath the Weeping Willow~
The drooping leaves and boughs of a magnificent willow provide a sense of
isolation in this section of the wood, offering partial concealment from
the elements and prying eyes.  The hanging leaves cascade downward like
rain over the branches, extending out to shade some of the river to the
west.  Soft greenish moss covers the lower trunk and root structure of
this ancient tree, a cushion against the hard-packed earth.  A few
mushrooms poke up through the layer of moss covering the ground.

Riverbank on the Mighty Elhanni~
A large rotting log, the remnants of a once mighty oak long since fallen,
dominates the landscape here where it extends out into the river to the
west.  The log does little to impede the flow of the swift river's
rushing current, yet the ebbing of the waters around the end of the log
seems to provide some protection against the erosion of the moss-covered
riverbank.  Just to the north, a towering multi-colored tree rises above
its surrounding neighbors, sheltering them 'neath its spreading boughs.

On the Elhanni - Beneath a Weeping Willow~
The rapid current of the river sweeps southward, beneath the shaded
covering of an ancient willow on the eastern bank.  The hanging leaves
extend over the river, shading the swirling waters below.  The western
bank of the river, covered with a thorny hedge and heavy forest growth,
seems perilous to climb and best left alone, while the eastern has a
shallow edge and a soft carpet of moss down to the waterline.

The turgid flow of the mighty river is intense here, rushing swiftly
towards the south.  The mighty Elhanni surges against its rocky banks,
too steep and thorny to climb, its force directed against the ancient
stone bridge that arches across its banks.  The smoothed stone of the

crashing against it with the power of the current.

The rippling surface of the Elhanni river flows swiftly as it passes over
this shallow ford.  The clear water swirls and ebbs over small rounded
stones and larger rocks which poke up above the flow, a trail of stepping

Before a Great MerryBlossom~
Dominating this area stands a legendary halfling Merryblossom.  Reputed
to induce peaceful dreams while resting, the Merryblossom is a symbol of
the halfling race.  The trunk of the tree is completely covered in a
light moss, home to many different varieties of flowers and mushrooms. 
Each of it's great branches is bedecked with different coloured leaves,
all with their own unique scent and colour.  There is an abundance of
activity here, bees in particular have made this ancient tree their home,
attracted to the bright colours and promise of sweet nectar.

flowers and mushrooms.  Each great branch sprouts different colored
leaves.  Countless bees buzz around the tree, attracted to the bright
colors and the scent of the multitude of flowers.

A great many flowers decorate the MerryBlossom, each diffrent colour to
its own branch.  Each branch has the same coloured leaves as its flowers,
making for a rainbow effect.  @RRed@n, @Yyellow@n, @Ggreen@n, @Wwhite@n, @Mmagenta@n, and @Bblue@n

Pockerly~
The thin treeline to the east is structured, almost orderly in its
placement.  A close row of ash trees form a vertical wall of trunks on
one side of this spacious clearing, almost as if it was created
purposefully as a windbreak or for a similar purpose.  A single holly
bush looks almost out of place in the centre of the pockerly, its
red-hued berries and spiked green leaves standing out against the white
and yellow daisies peeping out amid the short grass.

The thick tree cover encroaches upon this small clearing close by the
riverside.  Tall verdant grass, a foot in height, grows rampantly between

Splitting of Ways - Junction on the Elhanni~
The main flow of the Elhanni river surges in from the west, beneath a
strong looking bridge of oaken logs and rope, and continues in a
southerly direction.  The grassy bank to the east has been eroded by the
powerful force of the river, its rock and clay interior easily visible a
good foot above the waterline.  To the north, a smaller tributary of the
river can be seen coursing over top of a cliff, and even above the
torrent of the river, the thundering sound of rushing water crashing
against rocks can be clearly heard in the distance.

Elhanni Falls~
The sounds of the rushing river are overwhelming here.  To the north the
swift waters rush over the edge of a cliff, tumbling down in a single
unbroken flow into the distance far below.  A tall oak tree towers
against the western bank of the precipice, a thick branch hanging over
the river perhaps ten feet above the surface of the waters, far too high
to reach.  Both banks of the river here are clad in a blanket of clay and
rocks, the forceful flow of the water wearing away the grassy blanket
that covered them once years ago.

Bridge Over the Mighty Elhanni~
A sturdy bridge of solid oak spans the raging torrents of the mighty
river, flowing eastward beneath its weathered log planks.  Handrails of
twisted rope strands, braided together, hang on either side of the
bridge, both set at two feet and four feet high.  Supporting either end
of the span, low grass-covered banks lead away into the distance.  To the
north, a huge oak towers over the edge of the waterfall.

Before an Ancient Oak~
The knobbled oaken bark and solid, gangly branches of a huge tree climb
skywards, thick roots cracking the earth amidst the grassy meadow.  White
and red spotted mushrooms grow amidst the nest of roots, some almost as
round as a human hand.  The craggy skin of the tree and its many low
branches make it look as if it would be easy to scale.  Directly to the
east of the grassy carpet, the bank falls away sharply to reveal a
rushing river, tumbling down over the edge of a cliff in a cacophony of
sound.

In the Branches of an Ancient Oak~
The deep gnarled oaken trunk spirals upwards, branches spreading out to
form a huge cover of shadow over the ground far below.  A soft gust of
wind causes the leaves to stir, the gentle sound of the rustling greenery
muffling the echoes coming from the nearby waterfall.  A particularly
large branch hangs out towards the east, parallel to the apex of the
cascading falls.  Its bark is smooth and worn, as if its length has been

On an Overhanging Branch~
This overhanging branch hangs a good twenty feet above the top of the
waterfall, the rushing water hurtling downwards into the deep blue pool
far below.  The bark of this branch has been worn smooth by the passage
of many years, hands, and feet, a prime location to dive into the
sparkling waters formed by the cascading falls.

Cliffside Trail~
The valley falls away to the east, revealing a sheltered cliffside
waterfall and pool below.  This narrow trail is framed to the west by a
towering rocky cliff, with roughly four feet of walkable space.  The
trail is strewn with fallen rubble, and in places climbing is the only
way to pass.

Secluded Pool Below the Waterfall~
The sparkling clear waters of this pool seem strangely still, considering
the raging torrent of the waterfall cascading into it from the northern
end.  There is a heady air to the atmosphere, a tingling sensation of
enchantment and magic permeating the air and waters.  The rocky edges of
the vast natural pool are surrounded by a lush carpet of clover,
extending all the way to the rocky cliff walls rimming the entrance.

Entrance of a Grassy Valley~
Here, the hillside fades gently into a valley of verdant grass, filled
with flowering thistle.  The soft sound of the wind through the grass,
the scent of flowers on the air, all combine to give a feeling of calm
and peace.  A flock of diminutive purple-feathered birds roost high above
in nooks and crannies on the cliff, fluttering and flowing in the air

Overlooking the Forgotten Valley~
The trees back away from the rocky precipice below, forming a safe
perimeter distance from the craggy edge.  Small shrubs cling desperately
to the clifftop, unprotected and yet resilient against the strong wind. 
The panoramic view of the valley below is breathtaking, a verdant
paradise of grasses and trees, with pillars of smoke gently wisping up
from the snug, palisade wall enshrouded thorp to the north.  A jagged
rocky path winds its way down the steep slope, doubling back on itself
and weaving amidst sharp boulders and earthy rubble.

Rocky Cliff Path~
The trees fall away here from the hill's edge, and jumbled rocks lie
about like a child's forgotten toys left behind after a day's play. 
Sharp edges and jagged lines define the pathway as it wends its way up
the steep terrain of the rock-strewn cliffside path.  Clinging forgotten
amongst the rocks of the trail, a small crop of daisies flowers brightly,
adding a touch of colour to the drab walls of rough stone.

'Neath a Sheltering Oak~
An ancient oak, old beyond man's reckoning, rises here 'neath a cerulean
sky, its ancient limbs gnarled and twisted with age.  Its grasping roots
dig down deep into the earth, seeking nourishment and moisture from the
virgin soil.  Wide swatches of thin-bladed grass grow up to and beneath
the old giant, basking in the protection of densely-leaved branches.  In
the distance to the north, a haze of woodsmoke lies low against the
horizon, showing signs of habitation.

Grassy Plateau~
Burnt and dessicated ground gives way, grudgingly, to a grassy plateau. 
Low hanging clouds, rising from the river mist, obscure the view of the
surrounding countryside, with the only visible landmark being a tall
stony pillar rising to the east, piercing through the clouds and
disappearing skyward.  Pathways lead away from the desolation to the
north and west, and deep, intermittent rumblings come from nearby. 
Glancing northward is the likely source - the dark opening to the
habitation of some kind of burrowing creature.

Before the Ruins~
The surrounding terrain is a scene of utter devastation.  In sharp
contrast to the verdant life visible throughout the rest of the valley,
here nothing grows.  The earth here is charred and pitted almost as
though a great flame has branded it's heat upon the very soil itself. 
The scorched, blackened remains of what was once a stone structure of
sorts lies here, strewn across the landscape.  Towards the east, a mighty
pillar rises skyward, seemingly untouched by the devastation that befell
this small corner of the valley.

Tall rocky cliffs enclose the grassy carpeting of the valley in a close
embrace, rising up to either side.  A downy, light green moss grows on

Fallen Oak - Bend in the Path~
The dessicated husk of a ancient tree, long since felled by time and
weather, lies across the path there, forcing turns to both north and
south.  Little is left of the old giant except the vast, bark-stripped
trunk and the stump of an broken limb.  Patches of moss thrive on the
fertile wood, and a cluster of toadstools lies beneath one wrenched up
root.  The trail continues northward, toward a haze hanging below an

of a grey woodsmoke haze floating against the horizon.  As far as the eye
can see, only wide patches of verdant grass and stands of delicate clover
blanket the valley floor, save a lone oak rising in the distant south.

South of a Palisade Wall~
Bordered by a stout wooden palisade, a hard-packed dirt trail flows to
the east and west, disappearing into the trees in both directions.  The
surface of the road is pitted and rutted by countless scores of passing
wagons.  Thistles and foxgloves grow in brightly colored clumps around
the path, the patches of flowers and thorns adding a splash of color to
the grassland surrounds.  Southward, copses of trees begin to cluster
into a light woodlands, the trail winding into their heart.

South of a Palisade Wall - Wagon Trail~
A dusty road winds through the wild oats and grasses; its hard earthen
surface marred by the scars of wagon wheels and ox hooves.  A
spike-tipped palisade flanks the roadway to the north and east, further
towards the north a gate carves an entrance through the sturdy
fortification.  Westward, the grasslands wash against more of the stout
fence, the golden grains dotted with soft white and blue clover patches. 
A fine collection of thistles thrive at the eastern side of the trail,
their purple flowers drooping under their own weight.

Young oak and maples fight for space around the edge of a rope-lashed
wooden palisade, the tangled trees locked in a desperate race to fill the
void left by the clearing of older trees.  Toadstools spread across the
rotting stumps of felled trees, their delicate caps brightly colored to
warn of their poisonous nature.  Westward, a dirt track cuts through the
woodlands heading in a southwesterly direction, clusters of thistles and
wild grass flanking its sides.  The path runs parallel to the palisade

Large and darkly shadowed, the uneven form of the walls makes it
difficult to determine the extent of this hole.  Strange tufts of hair
litter the floor of the cavern, and fresh marks gouged into the ground in

Another silent victim of devastation, the marble statue before you
testifies with unspoken words to what happened here.  In a former life,
you imagine the marble statue to be of great importance, but the stoney
robed figure stands here, charred and ruined.  As a contrast to the fiery
destruction in this area, a small crop of daisies somehow manages to
cling to life in the blackened earth by the feet of the statue, a sign
that perhaps one day, this area will be verdant again.

A thick granite slab that was cut from a gold enriched vein rests in the
centre of this dark and putrid smelling room. Four thick blocks carved
from white granite hold the skeleton resting on this simple slab 1'6" off
the cold floor.
~
E
body~
Bleached bones of a well preserved skeleton rest here atop a cold granite
slab, most likely belonging to a long dead elven man.  Most bones have
stood the test of time and lie here undisturbed, but some bones such as
the skull and left femur have been shattered into nothing more than
shards of sharp white bone.  Tatters of black cloth cover the midsection
and chest of this long dead body, although its limbs and head remain on
display 
~
E
black cloth rotting~
Ancient black cloth has been spread atop this bleached skeleton, covering
all but its head and limbs.  At one time this cloth looks as if it could
have been a finely stitched robe or a lovingly crafted death shroud.

Halfway up the Crumbling Pillar~
The crumbling stonework of the pillar is black with soot and ash, marks
of the intense and raging heat that scorched the stone in the past. 
Vines and creepers inch their way around the darkened stone, clinging
tenaciously to solid column.  There is a glint of metal amid the vines,
semi-hidden within the dark green vegetation.

The vines, thick as a man's thumb and covered with darkly green

South of a Palisade Wall~
A stout wooden palisade cuts through the sun-drenched grasslands, the
rough timbers lashed together with rope and pegs.  A scattering of tree
stumps lie partially buried under a blanket of wild barley and clover,
the unfortunate trees cut down to provide a killing ground before the
fortification, and probably to provide some of the building timber. 
Eastward, a dusty road meanders through the high grass, its hard-packed
surface cut with the scars of wagonwheels.

Gap in a Palisade Wall~
A pair of wooden gates hang open here, creating a gaping hole in the
sturdy defenses of the spike-tipped palisade.  A set of wheel ruts, the
size of a small cart, have been worn in the earth, and it seems apparent
that the clover foliage abundant in most parts of this valley has been
worn away by the various types of traffic.  A small patch of wildflowers
grows undisturbed in the shade of the great wooden walls, patches of
vibrant purple and orange constrasting strongly against the knobbled bark
of the sharpened poles.

Way of Shinanne~
This quaint thorp has a definite halfling feel to it.  This, the main
road, is a simple path of packed earth flanked on either side by beds of
multi-coloured flowers.  Small children and animals run about barefoot
and carefree in this peaceful village environment.  The town itself seems
to be a combination of wooden huts and underground hobbit-holes built
into the hilly terrain in this section of the valley.  Set into the
hillside to the west, a circular oaken portal is decorated with a banner
of coloured cloth, the stitched image of a needle and thread emblazoned
on it.  To the east, a large field of vegetables is clearly visible,
while the main road continues north.

A Healthy Vegetable Field~
Row upon row of lettuces, carrots, potato, and other vegetables grow in
this well tilled field of vegetables.  The rows are even and orderly, and
there is barely a hint of weeds to be seen amongst the abundant food crop
that flourishes here.  A solid looking shack of oaken logs and thatched
straw has been built on the eastern end of this field, its crude
shuttered windows looking out over the growing plants.

Before a Painted Caravan~
A brightly painted wagon, large blocks of hewn wood wedged behind its
wheels, nestles between a pair of ancient oaks, creating a more permanent
home for its owner.  A muddy trail winds eastward from here, its earthen
surface flanked by wildflowers and grasses.  Light woodlands spreads
across the western hills, the mixture of maple, oak and walnut becoming a
dense forest further out.  A patch of @Wdaisies@n lies close by the wagon

itself stands around two feet high, and is capped with a wooden winch and
bucket.  The crossing dirt paths have been laid in a circular pattern
around the fountain, and small flowers and clover peek between the
rounded stones.  A silvery plaque set into the side of the well glimmers

Inside a Painted Caravan~
The wooden panels of the quaint caravan have been bedecked in floral
paintings, most deplicting frolicing animals bounding through fields of
flowers.  A circular stained glass window has been set in the northern
door, fine lead workings dividing the glass into four sections, each one
crafted into a different season.  Flax baskets and wicker dangle from the
rafters, a mixture of herbs and dried flowers hanging with them.  A
simple wooden half-door blocks the southern exit, a faint scuffling sound
emanating from the other side.

Way of Shinanne~
A dusty trail meanders through the village, the hard-packed path only
surviving through the determination of countless halfling feet that
trample down the prolific flora that threatens to envelop the entire town. 
Cascading wallflowers and tulips bustle for space amidst aster and
sunflowers, the riot of growth matched by a riot of color.  A grand
building rises to the west of the trail.  The thorp spreads southward,
the cluster of buildings singing with the energies of industrial
halflings hard at work and play.

The lower portions or the grand building have been cut from ash-colored
stone.  At its foundation tendrils of sunset-red ivy sprawl languidly,
the verdant plant only beginning to climb the rockface.  Above the stone
foundations rise walls of redwood, the richly grained wood polished with
a sweet-smelling oil.

With a flourish of colour, all manner of flowers spring to life on either

long petals a little dusty from the dirt road.  Mottled brown and yellow
wallflowers decorate the stone masonry around the lower foundations of
the building, adding a tranquil, rustic charm to the stately building.  A
swathe of scarlet red and sunshine yellow tulips dance among the thick
stems of the towering sunflowers.

Tobacco Way~
Carving its way through the pastural lands is a hard packed earthen
road, its rutted surface pockmarked from years of wagon wheels and heavy
tread.  A copse of slender birch trees spreads across the golden grasses,
their dappled trunks and branches silver and black.  The sweet smell of
flowers calls a swarm of bees to their embrace, the tiny insects darting
between clover, wall flowers, tulips and irises.

Tobacco Way~
A weatherworn picket fence meanders beside the earthern trail as it winds
in an east-west direction.  Rutted and scarred by wagons, the road is
poorly maintained despite being a merchant route.  Hillside houses sprout
across the surrounding landscape, brightly bedecked with tulips and wild
flowers.  Many of the homes appear to be built into the hillocks as well
as upon them.  A scattering of trees cluster together in a distant field.

The well-used path meanders through a mixture of flowers, grass and
shrubs on its east-west journey.  Hard packed by wagons and countless
tread, the roadway would be a quagmire of mud after a serious rainstorm. 
A crumbling red-brick wall runs parallel to the road, its surface coated
in lichen and a few spurs of wild rose and creeping ivy.  Hills rise to
the west and south, a few wisps of woodsmoke spiraling from them.

A perfectly circular door frames the grass and flower dappled hill to the

the grasses, belching a puff of wispy woodsmoke into the sky.  A
smattering of holly bushes spreads across the western rim of the hillock,
their bright red berries untouched by bird or insect.  A hard packed

Tobacco Way~
The obstinate ruts and strewn cobbles come abruptly to an end at the wide
eastern terminal of this bustling road, to the piping sound of voices and
the gentle din of industry.  Built of worn but sturdy wood, a small open
store to the north appears suited for ponies...but the harsh orange glow
and occasional ring of hammers is evident promise of a metal-worker's
wares.  Southward, rising gracefully out of the lush grass, a low
halfling dwelling bears the hanging sign of a fine armorer and crafter. 
A lone cart sits waiting for a merchant's whim near a rickety log fence,
enjoying the view of neatly-laid turnip fields that consume the eastern
soil.

Sagrin's Fine Armors~
The interior of this cozy halfling-hole has been shaped for function,
rather than for beauty.  The mahogany walls have been lined with racks to
hold a variety of types and styles of armour.  A simple wooden bunkbed
sits on the other side of a finely polished mahogany counter, as if the
proprietor of the shop spends a lot of her time working.  The room is lit
by a pair of bright oil lamps sitting on the counter, the shadows created
dancing lightly across the suits and helms nearby.

shields are positioned both on the floor and on the higher shelves.

Way of Shinanne~
The dirt path continues along the wide valley floor in a straight,
practical manner.  The grassy verge on either side of the road has
recently been cut back to a few inches tall, revealing a sea of brightly
coloured flowers.  Dominating the northern horizon, twin towering oaks
spread their massive branches, a flourish of laurel entwined throughout
the stately foliage.  Broad meadows of tulips and poppies stretch to the
east and west as the well-traveled road cuts through the middle on the
most direct route through the quaint village.

Altar of Shinanne~
A clearing opens up at the northern end of the dirt road, sheltered
beneath a pair of stately oaks.  On the far side is a simple altar of
greenish-black basalt, covered with what looks like a patchwork
tablecloth.  The clover has been permitted to grow long here, providing a
soft carpet beneath the feet.  Pockets of wildflowers grow amid the
clover, and the whole area has a rather peaceful, serene feeling to it. 
Atop the altar rest some standard clerical wares; holy water, a silver
holy symbol, and a not-so-standard mug of frothing ale.  On the far side
of the clearing, an ancient oak rises majestically toward the sky.

The sweet-scented clover runs rampant throughout the clearing, the

themselves from becoming too dominant.

The tall trees flank the altar on either side, extending their branches

many years.

Resting atop the altar, a slender vial of holy water and tall wooden mug

Dining Hall~
The lower section of the high-roofed building has been crafted from
neatly cut blocks of ash-hued stone.  A delicate layer of mortar runs
between each of the blocks ensuring the snug fit will last for many a
lifetime.  At about halfling head-height the walls transform into wide
red-wood panels, each of the fine-grained planks polished to a sheen
with grapeseed or linseed oil.  Set into the northern and southern walls
are whitewashed framed windows, the pale shutters tied with braided cord
enabling them to be bound in times of high wind and rain.  Squat
furniture spreads in a semi-circle around an oaken serving bench.  A
single door leads out of the mess hall to the east, a horseshoe and
mistletoe sprig above its arched keystone.
