Inside an Odd Cave~
At the entrance of this odd cave, the walls and floor are perfectly
smooth granite.  Other than the the rough boulder hole in the ceiling,
the cavern is precisely square.  The craftsmanship used to create the
cavern was flawless in application and harkens back to the golden age of
a proud dwarven underground empire.  The atmosphere is stale and
difficult to breathe, all vitality long since sucked from it.  The rush
of fresh air from the outside is almost palpable, bringing new life to
this stale chamber.  Further into the darkness, you can see a strange
glimmer, as if something metallic lays in wait.

Up ahead is a faint glimmer of metal and polished rock.  You can also
hear the incredibly faint sounds of metal moving against metal.

air stale fresh~
The air in here must not have been exposed to the outside world for a
very, very long time.  While it may not be the nicest air to breathe, it
is somehow nice to know that it lacks any outside influence and smells
like the past.

Square Cavern~
As the corridor moves deeper into the underground caves, the smooth
granite walls show odd metal pieces throughout.  It looks as if they were
shoved into the stonework to fill in cracks.  The little chunks of
copper, silver, and bronze give an eerie patchwork appearance to the
caves, looking ever more interesting in the light from the top of the
cave.

Metal Pieces Copper Silver Bronze~
Looking more closely at the pieces of metal that have been shoved into
the walls, it seems they are pieces of every kind of metal trinket you
can think of...from sword tips to mouse traps, tiny shards of detailed
sculpture to a few pieces of coinage.
~
E
mouse tip sculpture nest~
One area of the wall seems to be in the odd shape of a miniature metal
nest.  The mousetrap hinges and bits of sword form a small ring, roughly
welded into the wall.  A steady examination suggests this nest can be
removed intact from its perch with a little work.

Carved Doorway~
The floor here is so smooth, it seems as if it should be hard to traverse. 
This polished granite and metal room has an imposing wooden door at one
end, carved with a detailed forest landscape with many oddly detailed
creatures expertly engraved into it.  Above the door is a complex bronze
plaque with many gears and springs sticking out of it, the words of its
inscription hard to read without moving closer.  On the floor in front of
the portal lies an odd mat made of gears and wires.

E
Door Wood~
This large wooden door is carved with woodland creatures in a beautiful
forest glade.  Yet, at a closer examination, you notice that every
creature is somehow mechanical and artificial in appearance.  These
images are small and highly detailed.  The door has a highly advanced
mechanical lock with an intricate bronze mechanism.  Perhaps the key is
around here somewhere...
~
E
Plaque~
As you look at the plaque above the door, it seems to react to your
interest by slight twitches and waverings.  Concentrating on the plaque,
the gears and springs begin to move, rippling along the surface of the
bronze in an odd sort of dance.  As they move, you start to understand
what the plaque says as it cycles through various languages.  Coming upon
your native tongue, the gears slow down and then stop moving altogether;
you can then read the words, "Workshop of Mastersmith Byron".
~
E
creature~
Mechanical rabbits, mechanical birds, and even a spring and gear crafted
elven man, walk across this carved landscape.  An eerie feeling of being
watched sends shivers up and down your spine, when you examine the
doorscape and ponder the possibility of a mechanical world overwhelming
this one.

Stygian Descent Down a Vertical Shaft~
The vertical shaft through the solid mountain stone is naturally formed
and the hand and footholds are smooth to the touch, worn that way by
countless years of traffic.  Although relatively easy as climbs go, it
seems to go on forever through the musty mountain air.  Downward and
upward, a shimmer of light offers hope of an end to the destination.

Mountain Crack Face~
Looking at the mountainside, you notice a boulder had been fused into the
mountain face through either incredible tectonic forces or expert
craftsmanship, covering up a smooth cave opening.  Recently, this massive
stone has been loosened, revealing cracks arounds its edges.

Foyer~
Just beyond the great doors, the modest chamber seems anti-climactic. 
The unpretentious foyer was designed to hold guests until the master of
the house is ready to receive them.  From the look of the thick dust and
badly torn cloth chairs, it seems the master of the house has not greeted
anyone for a long time.  Apparently something occupies the dwelling;
numerous tiny footprints crisscross the otherwise undisturbed dust of the
floor.

Formal Dining Room~
Candles glow a pale reflective white from the tarnished candlesticks,
resting on the intricate stone table that dominates the room.  At the
head of the huge banquet table sits one solitary place setting, unused
and dust coated.  In the center of the table is an untarnished silver
teapot, strangely bright in this grey room.  From out the silver teapot
come countless tiny silver cords, seemingly the work of a horde of
spiders.  In fact, above the table is a glorious display of delicate grey
and silver arcing overhead in the dim light.  At a closer glance, never
have there been cobwebs with quite this pattern....and the work of
spiders has never before charged the air electrically quite so much...

teapot silver~
The teapot glows on the table, being one of the only polished things in
the room.  Oddly, the lid is still on the pot, with scores of tiny
grey-silver wires poking into it.  A very low humming noise comes from
within the strange teapot.
~
E
web wires~
The wires that cover the room all seem to focus towards the teapot
resting in the center of the table.  The smell of ozone pierces your
nostrils as you get close to the perfect, round web strands.  They look
strangely like metal, almost as if the spider strands were woven from
silver silk.
~
E
candlestick candle~
The multitude of candlesticks are in varying states of decay.  Some have
escaped the worst of the erosion and are only black with tarnish.  Others
have succumbed to the force of time and are little more than pitted,
twisted hunks of scrap metal.  A few have little dribbles of dried wax down
their sides, remnants of the candles they once held.
~
E
table~
Glossy onyx veins highlight the white marble tabletop like a pitch black
spiderweb of stone.  Resting nearly three feet off the ground, the top of
the polished table gleams in the light, despite the layer of dust which
coats its surface.  Several candlesticks are scattered about the
tabletop, so tarnished they look as if they are melting.  Twisting up
from the ground are four marble legs, each carved with the meticulous
skill of a master carver.  The jet black veins continue their winding way
down the legs, spinning their spiral pathways to the floor below.

Servant's Dining Room~
A harsh contrast to the glorious room through the archway, this space
boasts only a dry and brittle wooden table with two well-used and broken
chairs.  Curtains hang in tatters across the window, slowly falling in
shattered shards to floor as age overtakes each piece.  The ceiling and
floor are a patchwork of wood, stone, and rusted metal, as if it was
slowly being replaced by someone who has since given up on a fruitless
task.  Holes in every surface seem to be carefully drilled, not the
random machinations of woodworm or dry rot.

Moldy curtains drape limply over the window's cracked and split frame. 
The panes of the window are opaque with filth, but enough of the glass is
missing to provide a decent view of a vast underground canyon. 
Outcroppings of rock are dimly visible through the darkness, hinting at
probable placements of the cavern's boundaries, but the actual end of the
cavern is lost to sight.  Trickles of running water can be heard, echoing
up from the depths of the faintly glowing, moss covered gash in the earth.

Library~
Bordering a complex and daunting display of grey webs and wires are two
massive grey shapes that look surprisingly like dust covered bookshelves. 
Like silent sentinels guarding the room, they look as if they have never
been moved, a permanent and timeless feature in this place.  The stale
air and slight electric charge only adds to the timeless feeling.  The
dust has been sitting so long in one place that the air is clean, an
inconsistancy in this monochromatic room.

Not a trace of literature can be seen near the vast old bookshelves.  Not
even the dust patterns mark where books should have been.  Some of the
boards in the larger shelf gave way some time ago, causing the structure
to tilt sharply to the left.  The other case has lost most of its shelves
to dry rot, leaving a mounding pile of crumbling dust on the bottom shelf.

Cupboards~
Two large food cupboards have been placed here, out of place amidst
the fancy decor.  It is almost as if they were placed here as an
afterthought, for easy snacking access to the main room.  The contents
seem to prove that idea, with several jars labeled "cookie" and "jerky". 
Yet the main consumption done recently has all been of the metal variety,
for every metal object in this pantry is missing chunks of itself.

Kitchen~
Pots full of rusted cutlery lie all over stained countertops, odd
multi-color stained dishes are stacked high on the floor.  Cupboards are
spattered with stains and strange jars are cracked half open and tipped
over.  Everything here seems to be stained, broken, soiled, or rotten... 
from the floor to the dishes.  This dried, broken mess is truly topped by
the vision of the sink.  It used to hold water, as evidenced by the dried
plant-life that once grew in this place and across the whole room, only
to die when the rust finally overtook the sink and the whole mess
collapsed.

cracked stone sink and creep along the walls for some distance before it
stops, scant handspans from reaching the door.

Cutlery and Dish Cabinet~
Shattered cabinetry and crushed dishware litters the floor of the pantry. 
Rusting nails are the only tribute the mangled cabinets have to where
they once stood.  The room was once paneled in expensive-looking wood,
but many of the wall panels have come loose from the stone, to join the
wreckage on the ground.  Underfoot, cracks in the dry wooden floors have
trapped countless metallic gears, springs, and other useless bits and
pieces.  Only one cabinet, beaten but still hanging, has survived the
massacre.

Library~
The blackened bookshelves have been toppled into each other, with the
books themselves sprawled across the room.  Mounds of dusty old tomes lie
in tattered heaps across the floor in varying states of decay...torn
asunder, burnt by fell energy, or otherwise obliterated by magical
backlash.  Documents and letters are interspersed with the books, some
with the seal of the dwarven council, some with sketches of strange
sculptures, others the simple doodles of madness.  In the corner least
touched by the destruction, a mangled lounge chair and half-chewed
writing implements lie in a neat stack, clearly the preferred corner of
the creature who lived here.  Some literature has escaped the purge,
apparently intact and legible.

chaos~
@CIn an old dwarvish script, thus reads the notes of Byron.@n

I must...the life will not transfer to the perfect bodies if I only use
the simple laws of electricity.  I must find a way to harness the power
that life has flowing within it.  I must...damn.  I just cannot find
the right frequency, the voltage of the metal simply cannot hold the
right flow long enough.  It drains out into the air too fast.  They blink
with the field of life, but the magical spark of the creatures simply
will not go through.  I need to find a way to transfer the magic of life.
That special magi...

@C*@nThis passage drifts off into a broken line, as if the pen had been
dragged across the paper mindlessly when the writer drifted into an idea,
forgetting his scribblings...  A few pages later, the text continues, with
various sigils and odd names written in the corners of the pages between.@C*@n

Electricity..  An aspect of order and life!  But the gods of order deny
me any word of help.  I preserve life into the perfect golem forms, yet
they remove aspects of my own personal magic instead of granting me my
needs.  DAMN THEM!  I must find a way to realize the perfection of
eternal life...for all things.  The world as it needs to be...metal,
perfect...no living frailties..  I must keep trying!

@C*@nThe next few pages are filled with drawings of sacrifices one must
make to various gods.  Blood stains begin to appear, brown blotches on
the yellowed pages.@C*@n 

The dark gods will not listen.  They see not how a light dwarf could
possibly help them, as I would preserve both their light enemies as well
as their dark races.  Can they not see the truth behind all preservation? 
Can they not see that I must save the world as it is now, in the golden
age of history!?  I thought gods could see visions beyond those that any
mortal could see.  I think they see that with this I would achieve
immortality and fear me.  They fear what they cannot control, those who
would take their power!  I will become a god, and yet they cannot see the
debt I would owe the god that would grant me this wish!  I will find a
way.  I will ask the Dwarven King to petition our god, Duroth of the
Forge, to grant me the powers I need.  I will write a petition to the
Dwarven Council and they will understand my dreams of perfection
preserved forever, and so they will back me.  The gods might deny one
dwarf, but never the entire race, united as one!

@C*@n*After this section, a whole chunk of pages has been torn roughly from
the book.@C*@n

@C*@nFollowing the removed section, the writings appear in various
languages, both understandable and totally foreign to any mortal eye. 
Strange symbols begin appearing in the text, and you find it difficult to
read what it says.  Throughout various pages, the text goes thick and
brown, as if written in blood from a thick finger.@C*@n 


Denied..  Trapped..  understand....  NO!..

Power..  chaos preserves life.

Gandin will save all life... storm born electricity..

spirits....  bodies....  new

Sunpetal.. apprentice..  need .. preserve...

Blood.. weak..  must build... strong..  forever..

notice~
@C*@n On Formal Parchment, with the seal of the Dwarven Council @C*@n

All citizens of the Dwarven Race,

A great evil has spread across what was once a great good in the Dwarven
Kingdom.  One known as Byron has been found guilty of murder and the dark
manipulation of the spirits of his race, and the other races of this land.
We must cleanse our people of the hidden taint, and of the great evil
that threatens our way of life.

It is the ruling of the Dwarven High Council that one known as "Byron
Toymaker" shall be renamed throughout the history of the Dwarven people
as "Byron Lifecarver." Furthermore, he shall be sentenced to death for
crimes against the sentient and good races of the land.  It is the decree
of the council of elders that he is to be sealed within his mountain home
with all of his mad creations and tainted methods.

May mercy find his apprentice "Sunpetal Dreamsmaker", who shall also be
sealed within the mountain factory by no fault of her own, but due to
the taint of Byron Lifecarver.

So it is decreed by the Dwarven Council, and shall be throughout all time.

spell~
@C*@nYou open a moldy leather-bound tome in which very little is still
legible.  It seems to be some sort of ritual spell book.  Within the
volume, there are smatterings of chants and spells to appease the chaotic
aspects of Gandin, the god of storms.  One such chant catches your eye as
particularly disturbing.@C*@n 

As the ocean breaks the waves upon the shore, so must the mind break
thoughts upon the altar of chaos.  As the wind howls the tunes of chaos,
so must the mind howl the madness within.  As the lightning splits the
sky and the tree below, so must the mind split in order to understand and
harness the lightning.

As one mind cannot take the burden of chaos, the spirit must succumb to
the power of the storm.

As one spirit cannot take the burden, others must be brought into the
fray to lead to the power.

As the lightning splits the sky, it cannot split the spirit.

As the ocean breaks the waves, the ocean cannot break the mind.

As chaos can break all things, it is greater then all things; even the
spirit, and so the spirit must continue if the chaos is to be kept from
the mind, and if it is truly to be harnessed.  Like the land re-building
the shore with volcanoes, so must the souls be given to the chaos.

And it is thus that chaos be given form, that electricity be given
purpose, and the world be reborn.

Shells home to the power or the spirit?

Sentience in the mind, the spirit, or the power?

To create power, power must grow by itself.
To create itself, must be true life.

True life must be able to create spirit and body.

Power enough to create spirit, or simply to preserve spirit?

The Journal of Sunpetal Dreamsmaker.

The First Day of my New Apprenticeship!

Today I consider myself the luckiest gnome in the forest.  I can finally
prove myself as the best darn tinkerer in the city.  I signed on with the
Dwarven Mastersmith Byron and start my training today as his apprentice. 
Bet those guildmasters never saw this coming!  They always thought I was
just complaining when I said I couldn't find strong, small metal bits
good enough to really make my creations work, but they never believed me. 
Now, I can finally get the tiny precise parts I needed for my clockwork
toys.  Byron is incredible, so full of joy and ideas.  He has amazing
blueprints and sketches of fantastic mechanical toys.  So many unusual
ideas and such talent.  And he never had anyone working with him, until
today!  It is like a magical dream come true, nobody ever gets to see
inside Byron's workshop.  It is a secret place only spoken of as in
imagination.  I can only dream of what this will be like.  Heh, look at
me, bouncing around like a halfling turned loose in a crowded pub.

Day Two

I finally started today in the workshop.  I hardly slept at all last
night, the anticipation building until I sprung out of bed at dawn like a
child on his birthday.  I was allowed through the grand door into the
workshop.  It is rather funny actually, I had so many visions of this
magical home, that it was almost a relief to see the simplicity of the
place.  Just a normal home with a kitchen, dining room, and a library.. 
that is hardly anything simple.  You should see this place!  Every book
ever written about gears and springs sits on just one shelf.  I think he
wrote most of these books and blueprints himself, from the strengths of
metals, to magical properties of every kind of tool..  there is even a
tome here on the properties of life and creation..  It would take years
to read each volume.  I wonder how old Byron is.

He asked me to build something today, so he could see the skill level of
my work.  I built a little bird for him.  It would flap around the room
in a pretty loop and then land back on my shoulder.  Not my best work,
but it showed my talent.  He smiled as it went in the careful arc and
then sighed.  He said, "Your grasp of mathematics and mechanics is
remarkable, but it is missing, something" When I asked what it was
missing, he shrugged and said he wasn't sure.

Day Sixteen

It has been an odd sort of time so far.  Byron keeps me busy with my
creations.  It seems that he got a hold of much of my early work and
started quickly crafting a huge number of the tiny parts I usually use. 
Each time I create something, he adds to the piles of raw materials.  It
is scary how fast those piles grow, even with me working as fast as I can
to create the varied toys he requests.  Somehow, nothing I make is quite
good enough.  Oh, he smiles and applauds my work, but never can I get the
true bright joy behind his eyes of a finished project...he never seems
satisfied.  It is an odd thing, as this propels me to new heights of
creation, but disturbs me on an inner level, like he is on some sort of
mission.  Ah well, perhaps I am just tired.

Day Twenty.

I am not sure what is going on, but something odd happened today. I had
just finished creating an experimental mouse toy for him, with a multiple
gear system.  It had a lot of potential for various activities, like
walking in different patterns and moving like a real mouse might, but I
still needed to adjust the springs and gear slightly after each pattern
in order to change it.  I consider it a true masterpiece, with mutliple
ways to make people smile.  Byron had his normal sad expression, when he
suddenly smiled and jumped up from the table, throwing his mead clear
across the room in his sudden surprise!  Then he grabbed the little mouse
mid-stride and ran across the room into the library.  He then threw back
a bookcase and went down an odd set of stairs I had never seen before. 
As he ran down into the darkness, he said lightly "close the door and
wait for me" Very strange, but I cannot wait to see what happens.

* * *
Day Twenty Three

Life is dull without Byron around.  After dashing downstairs three days
ago, he hasn't come back once.  I hear flashes of electricity, like
lightning being thrown around, but have not seen Byron at all.  Smells of
smoke and burning come from downstairs but still no sign of him.

Day Twenty Nine

Byron came back upstairs today.  He brought with him my mechanical mouse. 
It moved in strange ways.  I am not sure how he has done it, but even
though I know that mouse could not possibly be real, it is somehow alive. 
Byron has managed to create the perfect gear and spring golem.  If I
didn't know better, I would say he just created life from metal.  He
asked me to study the behaviour of his mouse and tell him anything
strange.  I don't know what to say, the dwarf is a genius.

* * *
Day Thirty Three.

Dwarven Princess Isabal visited today.  She brought her special Byron toy
with her.  I found out that the toys that Byron handed out to the Dwarven
King's children have been talked about non-stop throughout the kingdom. 
I feel joy in the success that we have brought, but I still wonder how he
did it.  I am given the credit for my mechanical masterwork, but somehow
Byron did that extra step.  He has been talking recently about how his
new life is an "improvement" on flesh life.  I think he speaks in jest,
but sometimes I wonder about him.

Day Forty

Well, I finaly got my place set up in the lower testing laboratory.  The
Dwarven Council approved Byron's plans to create special golems for the
kingdom.  The toys that he made have been sent around the entire realm
and are in very high demand.  I am ecstatic that our work is making so
many people happy and has caused so many children to understand the joy
of creation again.  Byron finally told me what he had been doing with the
toys and it was so strange that I can hardly believe it worked.  He told
me what every living being carries in their structure.  The magic of a
living being has an electricty, like a magical power source that makes
every being do what it needs to.  He simply took the field away from the
tiny creatures, like mice and birds, and moved it into the toys.  I had a
bit of a hard time when I realized that the toys each would cost a tiny
creature its little life, but Byron explained to me that the creatures
live on inside my creations.  I think I will resolve to make each
creation as perfect as possible, so that every one is a wonderful home.

Stairway Entrance~
This odd stairwell looks like it was hastily built right out of the
rockface.  Stairs are carved into the back wall of an old closet, with
wooden wall panels suddenly breaking off into the stone shaft.  There may
have even been a door where this place joins the library, but now the
door is gone and the whole area leads downward into a roughly dug tunnel. 
The stone stairs are slippery and crude, almost like they were made for
barefeet.

Danger Notice~
The entire bottom of the slippery stone staircase is dominated by a
massive sign written in red and yellow dyes.  It covers the entire wall
facing the stairs, like a giant marker warning about something important. 
The message is a bit unclear, written in a long dead language.  The
passage continues onward into the darkness to the north.

The message seems a little less mysterious as you look more closely. 
Perhaps these bloodspattered squiggly lines, red arrows pointing downward
and upward, and the huge red circle with the dramatic line through it
mean something after all.  Whatever the case, the passage to the north
has interesting glows and drifting from out of the darkness.

Testing Preparation Room~
Various items used to be stored on the walls of this room, by the look of
the blank spots beneath large hanging hooks.  The items left shapes where
the dust could not settle: An outline of some sort of suit, an impression
left by some sort of amulet, and other strange shapes.  On the floor lies
strange torn bits of cloth, metal, and other materials, as if the
previously hanging items were torn into spare parts for some reason.  A
grey, dusty sign over the hooks has identification of these items,
written in that strange ancient tongue, and a small stylized lightning
bolt diagram.

Cluttered Hallway~
This room looks like it used to be plain and clean, but now it holds the
pieces and torn shreds of the various amulets and clothing once stored in
the adjoining room.  Burn marks and broken bones can also be seen strewn
about the room in places.  They look to be the bones of a variety of
creatures, from forest rabbits to desert snakes, and many that are now
too shattered to be identified.  On the wall is a torn leather poster, an
odd pictograph detailing the process of converting animal life to
mechanical life...

Amid the clutter and chaos on the floor are several shards of bone. 
Ranging from scraps as big as a needle to chunks that must have come from

fragments and left to rot on the floor.

Starting with a simple picture of a hyena, this diagram goes through the

travels along the step-by-step process, it goes further in the realms of
chaotic magic, until the pictograph itself is chaotically unreadable.

Entrances to Testing Areas~
The plain stone hallway flows to the east and west.  Thick strands of a
red, glowing material streak across the ceiling, branching out at every
intersection, apparently running through the walls above all the doors. 
To the north is a massive, intricately carved brown door.  It seems to be
made of the finest hardwood, but as you inspect it, you see that the
entire door is made of tiny wires, a brilliant attempt to precisely
reproduce the details of real wood using only metal.  To the south is
another massive door, yellow and made of tiny sand grains, like a sand
castle.

yellow sand 1 south~
Held together with a thin paste, the multitudinous sand grains are quite
abrasive to the touch.  In color a uniform matte yellow, they give
this door a dull finish.  The door is utterly featureless, with no handle
or hinges, or any other obvious means of opening.  Perhaps if the sand
was @Cwatered@n down, it would allow passage.

brown wood 1 north~
To the north, the brown door does a credible attempt at simulating wood
grain.  The effect is spoiled by the stabby bits of wire ends projecting
from the edges of the door, ready to jab unwary fingers.  A handle rests
in the right hand side of the door, approximatly two feet off the ground
for ease of dwarven access.
~
E
red glowing strands thick~
Set into the ceiling and held there by an unknown force, dozens of weakly
glowing red ropes run the length of the corridor.  Two of these cables
make sharp detours to run through the wall of the brown door, and two
more do the same for the door of sand.

Forest~
A forest in full spring regalia is sitting in a cavernous room.  A solid
granite wall at your right fences in the forest as it stretches on to the
north.  Trees reach up towards the ceiling, which has been painted a
light blue.  Low and almost inaudible, a metallic rustling sound pervades
the area, as if thousands of creatures were skittering across a steel
plate.  Branches sway gently in the constant soft breeze blowing only
from the north.  Every tree is flawless, perfect...and absolutely
identical.

Desert~
Dull yellow paint is peeling off the cavern walls in strips.  A giant
pile of sand has been lumped together into a minor hill, gently sloping
toward the door.  The dry heat is stifling, leeching any trace of
moisture from the cavern of sand - simulated desert.  Looking more like a
halfling child's sand box sand than a desert model, this room would be
more useful in polishing armor in the bright yellow sand than actually
being a good desert.

Entrances to Testing Areas~
To the north of this corridor is a translucent door of ice, riddled with
cracks throughout the surface.  At the touch, however, the door does not
feel quite like ice, despite the intense cold.  To your south is a screen
of seemingly bright green vines.  This door is obviously not made of
vines however, the wires have long since corroded into red rust from the
moist, warm air seeping throughout the door beyond.  To the east, you see
an odd-looking shimmering silver portal.

Cold, pale blue light shines through the translucent door and into the

They seem to be centered in the middle of the door and about three feet
off the ground, as if some object hit the door at a high speed.

A puddle of water is slowly creeping across the hallway, originating from
somewhere underneath the door of vines.  Stagnant and blackened by slime,
the pool has clearly been here for some time.  Mold grows in tendrils on

itself is a rusting mass of thick wires painted green.  The flagstones
near the base of the door are blackened, and a faint scent of ozone
lingers in the air.

As you enter the odd field of flat white beyond the door, a strange

temperature doesn't become significantly colder, in fact the tundra-like

This warm room looks like it once had a pool of clear water with algae
floating atop it.  Currently, though, it has a big rusty spot in the
middle of a shallow depression, with a snarl of wires clustered centrally
there.  The wall to the west has a tangle of crackling, glowing wires and
compressed rusty gears turning pitifully, trying to enact some unknown
purpose.  A weak spray of water comes from the ceiling, badly aimed
directly at the northern door.

Broken pieces of various items lie on the ground here, in grey

seems that this was another storage room for clothing and items, yet is
more torn up then its neighbor upstairs.  The hooks have been joined by

cabinet thick metal~
The metal cabinets once stretched from floor to ceiling and were nearly
three feet wide.  Inside, the remains of the shelves show that whatever
was stacked in here barely fit inside.  The steel shelves are badly bent
in the middle, and all are spaced three feet apart.  The worst of the
claw marks line up with the bottom shelf, and traces of a faint, small
scratching can also be seen on the inside of the door, as something tiny
fought for freedom from within the confines of the cabinet.

Swamp~
A large, long brown lump lies across this room.  This badly made tree
trunk stretches somewhat across the rusty depression.  Obviously only
intended to be seen from the top, this poor trunk seems to be lacking
anything beyond some brown false bark and support below.  A small nest
rests in a hollow underneath the trunk, near the depression that used to
be a wet swamp.

Footprints pepper this stretch of tundra, leaving almost no surface

a three foot square section of footprints imbedded in the ceiling.  The

Tundra~
Large natural-looking banks of snow rest here, surrounded by very
lifelike three dimensional figures, supposedly trees.  The banks of snow
have one major flaw though, they seem to make a sharp *clang* sound when

rushes a cool breeze, not unlike the cold air that rushes around the

Still flat, the tundra stretches before you into the horizon.  Looking
closer, you can see that the horizon is a cleverly painted mural on a

the wall and head east, travel for a few steps, and then stop.

Tundra~
Tucked safely beneath a clay rock, a campfire smoulders merrily in
this tundra clearing.  The pungent smell of smoking metal emanates
strongly from the glowing embers, concentrated most strongly in the
alcove designed to hold in the warmth.  It is considerably warmer in here
than the outlying area, although the rest of the tundra isn't
particularly cold.  Between the white outcropping above and the smoke
hanging around, this is the one place where the walls of the cavern
aren't visible.

The tangle of vines gives way to a wide, shallow depression in the floor. 
Several wide, flat rocks spread neatly across the depression in a
perfectly straight line.  The rocks have odd brown clumps of wires on the
surface, looking like dried algae.  It seems like the rocks were designed
to be stepping stones across the stagnant water before the lake
evaporated.

Elevated slightly from the depression in the floor, this patch of land is
muddy and damp.  The soupy patch of sludge has been tracked all over the

A sparse population of rocks breaks up the monotony of sand.  The rocks
look quite out of place, being mostly limestone and granite.  Some have
rolled off the hill of sand to rest at the base of the peeling wall.  It
seems that the largest rocks are simply perched precariously on top of
the dunes and not stuck to the ground.  Around the rocks are patches of
color where the sand has been stained with red ink.

Desert~
The sand in this stretch of the desert is randomly strewn with bones. 
Perhaps chosen for their dramatic effect, there seem to be only skulls
and leg bones tossed here, with every other body part missing.  There
also seems to be a very random assortment of species represented here,
from a mountain goat skull to a python skeleton.  The odd thing is, not a
single species represented in bone is actually a desert creature.

bones skull leg~
Neatly seperated into two distinct piles of leg bones and skulls, a large
portion of the landscape here is covered in the skeletal remains of
animals.  The pile of leg bones is neatly stacked into a pyramid, the
bigger bones at the bottom and the smaller ones near the top.  The skulls
are a little more scattered, probably because they don't stack well.  Cow
skulls, dog skulls...even a part of a dragon skull...all jumbled together
in a display of carnage.

Desert~
A dessicated pit sprawls across this portion of imitation desert.  Two
poorly painted palm trees lean on each other for support, as they tower
above the pit.  A granite boulder rests at the edge of the depression,
looking suspiciously like a place to sit.  A greenish tangle of wood,
vaguely resembling a plant, rests next to the boulder.

The lip of the hole is a soft tan, matching the rest of the desert.  The

and takes on a flaky texture.  At the very center of the depression in
the sand is a small, rust colored puddle.

It looks like the creator intended this to be a pool oasis for the

Stairway~
The walls surrounding the stairway are riddled with odd metal holes,
brushes, levers, and dials.  The stairs themselves sometimes echo
hollowly, while the air seems charged and an odd tingling sensation
ripples the air.  Only one item shows any pattern or stability in this
section of the complex; a complex sigil looms in the ceiling overhead,
like an offering to placate some god...or demon.

Hallway to Experimental Levels~
The hallway is strewn with evidence of struggle.  The walls are imbedded
with gears, splattered with oil and blood, and scarred by weapons during
combat.  Broken metal pieces crack underfoot with every step, pieces that
were unrecoverable and left to collect dust.  Overhead, there is a
disturbing sight...a pair of golem legs hangs grotesquesly out of the
ceiling, kicking feebly.  To the east, a dark stairway climbs upward into
darkness, while from the west, the sound of shuffling papers and the
click and whirr of moving gears issue along the corridor.

Parts of springs, shattered steel rods and broken bits and pieces of

Above your head, sticking out of the roof of the hallway, a partially

The dome is still intact, unbroken by the creatures living here, but the
scrolls inside have fallen to the ravages of time.  Various other scrolls

Impressions in the dust and fluttering collections of paper are all that
remain of what must have been a grand magic and research library. 
Shredded books pepper the room in a heartbreaking display of destruction. 
Bookcase hinges, torn free of the remnants of strong wooden bastions of
knowledge, lie on the ground here.  Dust and tiny scraps of torn pages
circle in the air with every movement you make, the ashes of history.  It
seems that the mechanical creatures in this place have struggled to
survive, and the first victim of survival was the past.

Day Eighty Seven

Well, I know I haven't written in a while, but times have changed.  Byron
has built a whole set of creatures that are more predator then toy.  He
had me create blueprints, working out the design so that he could figure
out how to make the toys, but then he built them all himself, life-sized
and dangerous.  The Dwarven King has asked for an army, I suspect, and
Byron has sold out to that cause.  I am scared and do not know where to
turn.  I talked to my family elders, but they simply laughed and said
that Byron, that joyful dwarf, couldn't possibly be a bad man, for they
only see the toys.  Byron put a call out to the dwarven hunter to bring
him back a hyena from the deserts of the east today.  I plan to hide in
the library until he has finished transferring its electric force into
the golem.  I don't know what to do except hope that Byron still has that
happy spark in him after his task is done.

Day 93

Byron has sealed off the entrance to the second level.  He says that he
does not want anyone getting in to disturb his work, yet he will not let
me leave.  I find myself, day after day, wondering what will beome of me. 
He recently built a machine that can create the toys that we once worked
so lovingly on every day.  He still sends these toys to the outside
world, like a token explanation of the hidden workshop, and a facade that
shows the joy that people expect to find in here.
* * *

Day 102

There was a scuffle at the door today.  I think that Byron was fighting
with someone or something, so I hid in the closet.  When I came out,
Byron was wiping blood off of his sleeves and muttering about the
falsehoods of honor.  I returned to my hiding.
* * *

Day 114

Byron has created sentient life.  A poor elven paladin has been
recreated in Byron's image.  Somehow he convinced the elf that he would
live forever.  Byron makes his case to the council tomorrow to allow him
to construct a larger area for his workshop.  He wants to create more
golems, to create an entire land of mechanical creatures.  He does not
know, but I sent one of the birds from the very first days out to the
council with a note about the poor paladin.  I feel like I am betraying
my master by this action, but may be saving the whole kingdom.

Day 354

My life is over.  Byron went truly mad after they sealed us in the
mountain.  He had captured more then that one paladin, and he found a way
to create true magic in his golems.  He even discovered a way to create
the tiny imperfections of life.  He found a way to create me.  He then
found a way to turn life off, much like a candle is snuffed out.  Then he
created himself.  Byron has achieved immortality, and it is up to me to
find a way to keep myself sane.
* * *

Day 1076

Three years in this mountain.  In the dark.  Rebuilding my body so that
one day I can defeat Byron and be strong enough to rebel against him..  I
am almost done. Soon, I will be strong enough to lead an army of his
creations against their maker, and we will end this madness.  I cannot
convince or train the mad ones, the experiments in the zone of magic gone
wild, but one day we will.... oh ... Free ....

Day ?

We defeated Byron.  Freedom is ours.  Yet still he lives.  Somehow he
found a way to stop our weapons, to break our electric spirits.  We could
only bind him from a distance like a slave.  And now we sit and wait and
slowly go mad in the darkness that we cannot escape.

* * *

Day ---

All have gone mad.  Nobody can help us now.  I am the last to have any
thoughts beyond survival and mechanical ones.  The others only think of
survival.  Animals, even the most noble of them..  Perhaps one day
somebody will put my rusted body to rest.  I only hope that madness is
peaceful

Burned Library~
This room is blackened and covered in soot from a long-cold fire.  The
shells of bookcases lie in ruins, and the dark dust of what once was
paper, hangs depressingly in the air.  The blaze seems to have been
isolated to this room, as the scavenged floorboards around the room acted
as an ironic firebreak.  Ash coats every surface, the stench of countless
hours of lost work filling the air.  With a little observation, it seems
that this room was already torn apart before it was burned.

bookcases shell dust~
The blackened and burnt bookcases are truly a depressing sight.  Every
part of the wood has been blackened with the raging fire that only could
have been caused by the destruction of the books that once graced these
shelves.  Only small parts of the bookcases show any sign of cohesion,
and these have been chewed on and torn at by the denizens of the area. 
These shelves once held the greatest triumph of a culture, and now are
just the shredded remnants of a society collapsed.

room torn~
It looks as if the fire was actually an accidental one.  The floorboards
are missing in some spots not due to fire, but to the creatures here
needing the raw materials.  From your observations, it seems that the
fire was simply caused by the sparking of the golems, which means that
they may still be in disrepair and malfunctioning even then.

Testing Parts~
Tons of granite form blocky rows of workbenches that stretch out over the
room.  Some are set in the center, some diagonally, some pressed against
one another forming a veritable maze of three-foot-high counter space. 
Each section prominently displays an assortment of levers and buttons.  A
puce-green handle shaped like a dragon's head shines on one table, a
softly glowing amber button and a lever fashioned from a walrus tusk
nearby.  In another corner a skeletal arm serves as a lever, while
underneath is a polished black button.  Hanging in the exact center of
the ceiling is a silver chain with a petrified chicken foot acting as a
handle on the end.  There is an odd pool of stagnant water sitting on one
side of the room, seemingly for no purpose.

Carved from a puce-colored jade, the carved dragon's head appears to have
been impaled upon the wooden haft.  The jaws are open and the lips furled
back, sneering.  Red-painted eyes squint from beneath prominent and
cross-looking brow ridges.  Several horns protrude from the triangular
shaped skull, ready to stab the unwary.

Warmth seems to radiate from the glowing amber button.  Runes etched in
silver surround the pulsating circle in a flowing script.  Looking closer
into the translucent surface, you see a million points of white light
dancing just below the lacquer.
~
E
skeletal arm~
A three-fingered skeletal hand reaches out from the panel, attached to a
delicate arm bone.  Every piece of bone has been wired together with
copper thread, keeping the integrity of the skeleton intact.  There
appears to be space on the hand for two more fingers, but they are
nowhere to be seen.
~
E
chicken foot handle~
Polished chicken claws reach for the floor, splayed as far as chicken
claws can.  The foot has been severed at the base of the chicken and
dried, then polished to gleam from its position on the silver chain.  The
silver chain, extending from an indeterminate point in the ceiling, wraps
around the leg and has been tied on with a velvet strip of cloth.  It
hangs straight down, unmoving in the dead air.
~
E
walrus tusk~
Dried walrus slobber still clings to this unadorned tusk.  This large
tooth has yellowed with age and is starting to crack along one side.  It
has been hollowed out and attached to a stick that continues down into
the depths of the workbench.

Warrior Haven~
Loose dirt mixed with sand blankets the floor, perfect for sopping up
blood.  The room is faultlessly circular with a giant arched ceiling,
soaring twenty or more feet into the air.  A simple cot along one wall is
the only furniture, a massive battle axe on the wall the only
ornamentation.  A soft, yet frantic sobbing can be heard echoing
throughout the underground chamber, the high pitched tone seeming the
very essence of despair.

cot simple~
A plain box frame supports a straw mat for sleeping, yet there is no way
the occupant of this room could fit comfortably on the five-foot long bed. 
The mat looks undisturbed, and even has a little dust settled on its
surface.  The disembodied sobbing seems louder in this corner.
~
E
under cot~
Underneath the bed is a small tube.  Red light emanates from the opening,
dim enough to be noticed in the gloom but not bright enough to provide
enough light to see by.  Wailing comes from the tube, as if dozens of
women were crying in horror.
~
E
axe massive battle~
Hanging at an angle above the cot is an enormous battle axe.  Jewels stud
the length of the handle and a giant, blood red ruby is set in the handle
near the blade of the axe.  The twin blades of the axe are forged out of
gold, dazzlingly bright, and sharpened to a razor edge.  Runes etched
into the edges of the blade have been filled in with dried blood, some
escaping the gutters to dribble down the sides of this mammoth weapon.
~
E
runes blood edge~
The blood-filled runes have no decipherable meaning, but the edges of
some runes do not glint with gold.  The gold leaf is peeling around these
runes, revealing the base metal underneath.  Apparently this axe is
actually made out of lead.

Electric Field~
Blocks of steel have been set into the stone walls, apparently at random
points.  The room appears to be abandoned, as corrosion and dust have gathered
on the floor, undisturbed for a long time.  Yet the steel blocks remain
so highly polished they are nearly mirror-like.  Long strips of copper, as
wide as a dwarf and stretching the length of the corridor, have been
firmly attached to the ceiling.  Contained lightning seems to play across
the shiny reddish surface, adding a crackle to the air.

Testing Triggers~
The stench of rotting meat wafts up from a grate imbedded in the sloping
floor.  Putrid yellow stains have dried onto the floor surrounding the
grill, and bits of brown sludge can be seen clinging to the individual
bars.  The triangular room has a mismatched set of workbenches, one on
each wall flanking the door.  The left bench is made of polished
mahogany, upon which rests an array of buttons.  One button is white, the
other with a flaming skull motif painted on, and in between them is a
delicate pink switch.  Opposite this is a bench of solid iron, with the
beginnings of corrosion at the edges.  This implement features a knob
made from a glass eyeball, a lever fashioned from crystal, and a slightly
melted green button.

Pristine and gleaming, this petite button practically glows with

A scowling human skull, wreathed in flames, is starkly set against a
midnight black background.  This thick, black button seems almost damp

A tiny switch, dwarfed by the large black button next to it, this switch
looks more like a spiraled seashell than a switch.  Pink swirls curve

The crystal forming this lever has been carved out of a solid block.

Ranger Sanctuary~
Thick trees brush the ceilings with their leafy tops.  The ceiling has
been painted with the rainbow colors of breaking dawn, and a gold-plated
orb dangles from the ceiling opposite the door.  The walls have been
painted to resemble a solid ring of trees, with the occasional glimmer of
sunlight peeking through the mighty trunks.  Steel-wrought butterflies
swing from strings off the branches of several trees, swaying faintly in
the brimstone-scented breeze.  A stone bench, similar to what might be
found in a king's private garden, rests in the center of the clearing in
the center of the room.

This carved stone bench has just enough space for two dwarves to sit side
by side, provided those dwarves are willing to get quite close.  The feet
of the bench have been carved to look like paws - either the paws of a
lion or a giant squirrel, the lines are worn and indistinct.  The smooth
grey stone is peppered with white spots - the leavings of countless birds.
~
E
butterflies steel-wrought~
A stampede of brightly colored butterflies dangles from the upper
branches of the steel trees.  No two butterflies are painted the same way. 
Black edges frame a pair of deep, rich lime wings on a black speckled
butterfly.  An iridescent butterfly starts as a light blue and darkens,
turning a deep indigo at the tips.  Orange and black swirls grace the
wings of a large butterfly.  Others are sporting slightly less
traditional colors - one has been plated in beaten copper...another edged
in slightly tarnished brass.  All dance in the breeze, pirouetting around
their strings in an intricate dance.

Supported by a framework of wood and iron, a large gold-covered ball

Odd Pulsating Machine~
Clanking, hissing, and smoking, a giant collection of...stuff...dominates
the room.  Flame shoots from small tubes pointing towards the ceiling.  A
large transparent globe rests on a spinning platform of brass, and little
spokes protruding from the horizontal wheel crash into other parts also
spinning.  Jets of steam spurt with a loud, high pitched whistling from
an unidentified source deep within the bowels of the metal monstrosity. 
Several cone-shaped spokes encircle an empty spot in the room, where a
pair of footprints have been painted in white.  Easily reachable from
that spot is a solid block of waist high (to a dwarf) steel, featureless
except for one shiny red button.

The sphere rests on a twisting platform which seemingly flows up from the

Inside the globe, apparently suspended in midair, is the silhouette of a

Wooden slats cover the walls in this otherwise empty room.  Thick, drab
dust forms outlines of strange tools on the wood paneled walls.  The only

massive number, and sheer variety, of hooks that are still stuck in the

Healing Room~
A small number of tools have survived in this room, bolted to the wall to
prevent loss.  Alongside these tools sits a small pile of coal, to be
used as fuel, and a large sign in red.  The sign is written in scratches
and odd markings, obviously a language, but not one like you have ever
seen.  This room has an assortment of pieces from the mechanical
creatures that live in this place, spare parts for the living.

The pile of spare parts here seem to be ones that would be used in golem
repairs.  Clean and shaped metal plates, spare wires and gears, and even
a neat pile of random materials that seem to be specific to one type of

weapons are carefully bolted to the workbench.  Even a few metal ingots

The entire chamber is bathed in pulsating, fiery light coming from the

Electric Field~
This room is completly barren, save for a few clumps of dust on the stone
floor.  More of the copper strips adorn the ceiling, relatively thin at
the northern end where they apparently vanish into a wall, and growing
thicker as they proceed southward.  The devastation so prevalent in the
main corridor has not reached the chamber, making it seem strangely calm
here.  Miniature lightning bolts crackle along the copper path, always
traveling from the south to the north.

The strips of copper are more easily seen here, away from the destruction
of the main hall.  They have a shiny surface with very vague, but
detailed set of runes and symbols carved into the surface.  The strips
are complete from floor to ceiling and seem to wrap the room not only on
the walls, but also inside the cavern stoneworking.

lightning bolts~
The tiny bolts of electricity travel in perfect arcs across the copper
path, magically transmitting the messages of the runes in the copper
strips to the chaotic god that answers the summons...tiny perfect spacing
and bolts, in ironic parody of the chaos that they call upon.

One steel block is set into the otherwise bland stone walls.  The
perfectly square room is barren except for a symmetrical mound of rust
in the exact center of the room.  A thick copper strip in the ceiling
branches out into several thinner strips, covering the ceiling in a
latticework of metal.

The copper pathway snakes in from the south and branches out to stretch
all over the ceiling.  The room itself is empty and quite dust-free.  The
hard packed dirt floor has not been torn up, there are no piles of
rusting corpses, and there is no evidence of anything happening in this
room for quite some time.  Right next to the doorway, a doormat woven
from steel threads rests on the floor.

The walls here, contrasting with the rest of the warren, are made of
limestone.  Yet the ceiling continues to be the same rock.  Scraps of
iron and wood have been thrown into a pile in the corner of the room,
looking like an attempt at a bed.  One of the copper strands has become
dislodged from the ceiling and dangles, forgotten, in the center of the

Piles of Random Materials~
The air in the corridor seems alive with power.  Sparks fly from bits of
wires imbedded in the stone walls, giving off enough static to make hair
stand on end and producing a never-ending series of zapping, popping
sounds.  Fell energy ripples from the copper plates in the ceiling,
pouring along the metal channel like liquid fire and bathing the room in
a flickering white light.  Corpses of tiny mechanical forest creatures
litter the ground, laying in heaps along the walls.

Piles of Random Materials~
The corridor finally comes to an end at a rather plain-looking stone
wall, with a heavy wooden door set slightly off center in the stone.  The
door is completly barricaded, as a solid half-circle of dead golems rings
the door, with the corpses stacked nearly five feet high in places.  The
broken pieces of golems spread across the stone floor in a mockery of
death.  Here, a new element has been added to the wanton destruction -
blood.

Manservant Chambers~
The decorations in this room were once living, breathing animals.  Now
their corpses, stuffed and mounted, serve as wall hangings, furniture,
and models.  A stuffed grey mouse, ferociously posed, is standing on a
table covered in bear hide.  Beside the mouse, a stack of parchment with
drawings of clockwork mice rests within a few breaths of toppling to the
floor.  A dead unicorn adorns another corner, her broad back serving as
another table and her horn used as a hat rack.  A twelve point stag faces
her, coats and jackets dangling from his antlers.  Folded into a small
ball, a stuffed hedgehog footrest faces the alligator-hide chair. 
Countless stacks of other creatures fill every available space, jumbled
together in heaps of death and fuzz.

Byron's Inner Sanctum~
Gashed granite walls have become a living tomb for the mad dwarf. 
Remnants of a once-great workshop, the tools of craftsmanship now lie in
ruin and decay.  An iron anvil has melted into oblivion near a forge
clogged with ash and dirt.  Ivy, long dead, trails from a moldy workbench
and up a wall where it came into contact with one of the copper plates in
the ceiling.  All of the copper strings lead into this room where they
join together above the iron-clad body of Byron Lifecarver.  A thick
metal door breaches the wall to the south, a lever of similar material
the only means to open it.

The walls and floor here are covered with the finest racks of fantastic

can be seen, all racked and ready for use...or they would be if they
weren't so rusty and tarnished with extreme age.  A few also seem to have

that mace would make a good meal.  The rest seem to be sealed against the

Paladin Palisade~
Carved from the solid stone of the mountain, this room has been converted
into a makeshift temple.  It is seamlessly circular, nearly forty feet
across at its widest point.  The floor is hard-packed dirt and is badly
scuffed.  An altar, carved from generic-looking rock and highlighted with
steel, has been set up at the far end of the room.  Torches in wall
sconces shed fiery light on the scene, illuminating some tattered and
mismatched scraps of cloth hanging on the walls.  The air is musty and

Immediately beyond the entrance to this room, the floor turns to dirt.

Bland, slate grey rock forms a lumpy altar which rests near the far wall. 
Designs that look vaguely mystical have been carved into the sides of the
rock and inset wth steel.  The altar seems inconsistent with the rest of

Chandros, known as the God of Justice.  Yet the altar has manacles bolted

Clearly intended to serve as banners, the motley assortment of cloths

few show signs of mildew.  They have all been painted, rather than the
more traditionaly woven, with the bastard sword silhouette against a
rising sun - the holy symbol of Chandros.

Tall, sturdy pines encroach upon a faint path that winds a serpentine
trail along the mountainside.  A rotting stump, the decaying corpse of an
ancient forest giant, lies overturned in the middle of the path, feathery
ferns surrounding it like a funeral wreath.  The air is still, the almost
palpable silence broken only by the pervasive rustle of diminutive

Skirting the Mountainside~
The narrow trail continues on, zigzagging along the mountain's face in a
variety of incredibly sharp turns and crumbling edges.  The old pines,
both above and below path, cast deep shadows on the cold grey stone and
hard-scrabble ground.  The dappled play of light against dark fashions a
patchwork quilt of greens here in the depths of the Everwinters.

trail turns edges~
The path widens and narrows randomly, with a mind of its own, zigzagging
sharply then flattening out a foot or two further on.  In places, it has
crumbled away to near-nothingness to create a treacherous passage around
the mountain.

Skirting the Mountainside~
The path begins to widen here as it approaches the opening of a
forbidding cave.  Heavily forested slopes still rise above and below the
bed of the trail, the ground underfoot swept nearly clean of the normal
mountain debris.  A handful of smaller stones surround an odd-shaped
depression lying close one particularly gnarled pine.  The path continues
onward to both the west and southward toward the road.

stones depression odd gnarled pine~
One particularly gnarled pine shades a depression in the path.  The
depression, filled with fallen needles and broken pine cones, is
irregularly shaped, but not deep - about the size and width of a human
child or an adult dwarf.

Before a Forbidding Cave~
The path comes to an end before an opening in the mountainside - a gaping
maw, like a giant's mouth frozen mid-yawn.  Struggling to survive in the
rocky soil, a stunted bush perches like an eyebrow raised in surprise
above the aperture, its situation precarious at best.  A boulder, fallen
down the slopes, rests close to the cave mouth, a few scruffy clumps of
tussock sprouting at its base.

Within a Dank Cave~
Although not overly-large, the dank and musty cave still manages to be
eerily foreboding.  The only light, filtering in through the opening to
the south, does little to lift the surrounding darkness.  Underfoot, the
cavern floor is irregular, the footing unsteady at best.  Cold stone
walls rise upward, disappearing overhead into secret shadows.  Toward the
back of the naturally-formed opening in the mountain, a circle of black
leads down into another cave below.
