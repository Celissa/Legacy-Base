Before a Shimmering Silver Portal~
Fluffy white, and soft as silk, the vaporous clouds have coalesced to
form a solid mass sturdy enough to bear most weight.  This surreal
landscape seems to shift slightly from moment to moment as if it were
moving; yet the general makeup remains the same.  As though mimicking
mundane ground, a slightly elevated, smooth-surfaced path leads toward
the north.  Flanked by neat, pillar-like squares of puffy clouds, the
path is obviously an intentional creation and not a random generation of
climatic effects.

path 1 north~
Elevated and flanked by the small square pillars, this flat section of
the cloud could only be a path.  Seemingly safe to walk upon, the path
leads off to the north, away from the silver portal and farther out on
the surface of this bright white cloud.

On closer inspection the flowing rune actually surrounds a small picture,

Flowing out across the skies, a clumpy white cloud stretches forth
seemingly without end.  The normally gaseous, cumulus creations have
coalesced to form a slightly solid mass, hinting at more than a little
arcane power.  A small parody of a mundane path, complete with miniature
cloud pillars, leads in all directions save west; the cloud there
appearing to be less cohesive and unable to bear weight.

Gazing out towards the southwest, a patchwork of fields can bee seen,

Rising forth from the unbroken pearlescent surface of the cloud, a shiny
silver portal stands a short distance to the southwest.  Small and large
birds alike, flitter and flap above the surface of these cumulus
creations, diving through the surface of the cloud in a child-like game. 
The surface of the cloud thins out to the south, lending the impression
of cotton that has been stretched too thin.  This thin strand of clouds
offers a view of the ground far below, albeit in a slightly distorted
view.

Retaining the same design in all three directions from this t-junction,
small pillars flank this carefully created mockery of the ground below. 
Obviously, this odd trail was meant to circle around the glowing orb just
a short distance to the northeast.  Nearly making the pearlescent clouds
seem mundane and boring, this semi-blinding orb appears to be a miniature
sun hanging suspended in the air.  The ground appears to be stable...as
stable as a cloud can be...in all directions save west, where it thins to
the point of near-transparency.

Curving around to complete the visible circle, the carefully manipulated
path...for path it obviously is, even to the casual observer...flows with
the arcane arts.  Flanked by white pillars of billowing vapors in an
effort to further define the flat, level plane, the trail through the
clouds encircles a brightly glowing orb suspended in midair, pulsating
with an unknown purpose.  Birds soar freely, paying little heed to the
orb as they wing their way through the sky.

Another carefully crafted curve in the cloudy path helps complete the
circle in the sky.  Flanking this mimicry of an earthbound path, small
cumulus clouds stand as queit sentinels, airy pillars relacing the marker
stones of a mundane road.  No doubt this ring's sole purpose is to
circumscribe the glowing orb positioned a short distance to the southwest. 
The orb is nearly blinding; it pulsates slightly as it hangs suspended in
the air, burning with the intensity of a miniature sun.  Small birds seem
to not notice as they flutter and fly all around, some diving through the
surface of the clouds that now bear your weight.

Continuing to both the south and east, the magically crafted path atop
the cumulus cloud curves majestically here.  Flanked by pillars along its
entire length, this small trail was obviously meant to appear as a road
on the ground would.  This odd trail curves around a glowing orb just a
short distance to the southeast.  Breathtakingly bright, this brilliant
orb makes the cloudy ground seem common and simple.  The cloud's surface
looks to be unstable to both the west and north; its normally lumpy and
thick makeup is thin and wispy.

Crafted out of puffy clumps of cotton-like clouds and misty wisps of
brilliant white, the ground here is far from normal.  Dazzling rays of
light reflect off the pefectly white surface of these rain-bringing
creations.  A carefully cultivated turn on the mockery of a path leads
around an unseen obstacle to the north, the clouds there all appearing to
be able to bear weight.  Though the surface appears stable, this path
does not seem as if it would curve without reason.

Wisps of barely noticeable clouds drift continuously on gentle wind
currents.  Though the air should be cold at this altitude, it is
pleasantly comfortable to the average passerby.  A carefully cultivated
turn on the mockery of a path leads off towards the east.  The clouds to
both the south and west thin considerably in comparison to the solidified
mass that supports your weight.  Faint images of the ground far below are
visible, at such an extreme height that no great detail can be perceived.

Thinning considerably, the puffy white clouds are mere wisps clinging
together in an effort to maintain cohesion.  Glancing through the surface
of the clouds to the west offers a slightly hazy view of the ground far
below; the distance combined with the thin veil of clouds making details
impossible to see.  The only part of the cloud that still appears stable
is the path, running north and south.  The small path appears as a normal
road on the ground would, level and straight, complete with short,
flanking clouds in the shape of small pillars.

Flittering and floating, pure white creatures of roughly humanoid shapes
seem to meld into and form from the clouds surface to the west.  A thick
clump of cumulus clouds form in that direction, separated by great
distances of vaporous, misty clouds.  A small path begins to the south,
leading in that direction, its edges flanked by small square pillars
crafted out of the same cloudy material as the path.  The clouds to the
north and east have solidified almost entirely, leaving only scant
sections of the cloud dangerous to walk upon, where it remains thin and
gaseous.

Wispy white clouds drift at foot level, slowly condensing into a tight
cumulus formation that is able to bear weight.  Arcane magics are
obviously active, for no natural cloud could ever support a person.  The
clouds to the south are still vaporously thin, offering a view, albeit
hazy, of the countryside beneath; a crazy patchwork of fields, mountains
and forest, that hints at the extreme altitude of these cloud formations. 
The clouds in the other cardinal directions seem to have solidified
almost entirely, their puffy formations mimicking boulder strewn ground.

The cloud formation here is thin and surrounded by wispy tendrils of
clouds, slowly merging with the surface of the cloud as a whole.  Though
the ground remains stable, it is obviously a newer creation than the
ground to the west.  The surface of the cloud is just barely dense enough
to prevent view of the ground below, although the areas to the south and
east are thin enough to offer a hazy view.  The clouds are more level
here, too infantile to billow out and take shapes of their own like the
surface to the west.

As if strewn with boulders, the puffy wide cumulus clouds are far from
level on the surface.  Softly billowing out as they continuously grow,
the magics condensing them have no apparent reason to make them level
here.  Wispy tendrils of newly formed clouds, dance through the air as
they travel their natural progression across the world.  Staring out in
all directions, offers the same view, a rarely level yet stable cloud
surface, sitting stagnant in the skies.

Wispy white clouds drift at foot level, slowly condensing into a tight
cumulus formation that is able to bear weight.  The surface of the cloud
is just barely dense enough to prevent view of the world below, although
the area to the east is thin enough to offer a hazy view.  A large
cumulus formation has formed some distance to the east, white doves and
humanoid shapes flying and playing on its surface.  Although the mockery
of ground to the north and south is wispy thin, it appears to be able to
support weight, however a jump over the thinner tendrils would be
necessary.

Roughly humanoid in shape, large white creations can be seen melding with
and out of the clouds to the west, as if that were a highly magical area. 
The largest grouping of cumulus clouds can be seen in that direction, so
dense and thick those parts of it are too high to see their top. 
Separating this cumulus cloud from the western one, are large distances
of vaporous, thin clouds: these distances too wide to even conceive of
jumping them.  Though far from level, the ground to the east and north
appears to be substantial enough to support your weight; possibly the
only way to gain access to the cloud to the west.

Dominating the area, twin lumpy blocks of cumulus matter rise from the

lending them as landmarks to pinpoint the exact location of safe ground. 
They draw your attention to a small bridge, which seems to link two large

doubt that they are being manipulated by arcane magics as clouds tend to

Small tendrils break apart from the monstrous cumulus cloud far to the east. 
Minute traces, barely recognizable as fingers of a cloud, drift at foot
level, some condensing and helping form this magically created cloud. 
Though the surface of the cloud is dense and thick, this is certainly the
edge, with the lumpy cumulus clouds quickly becoming gaseous to the east. 
White doves and humanoid shapes are evident on the surface of the clouds
to the east, flying and playing oblivious to their surroundings.  The
surface of the cloud becomes lumpier and more substantial to the west,
giving the impression that it would be safer there then here so close to
the edge.

Standing here it becomes apparant that the entirety of this cloud is not
a singular entity, but instead two large cumulus clouds that have joined
together.  The bright whites are perfect matches for each other, although
the joining is not yet complete.  The merging occurs to the north, the
slight gap between the two clouds slowly filling in with wispy tendrils. 
The only solid connection lies to the northwest where a bridge-like
formation has coupled the clouds together.

Nearly ethereal and just barely not transparent, a thin bridge of opaque
material spans the distance between two large cumulus clouds.  The bridge
appears to be as fragile as spun glass, ready to break apart at any
moment.  Only obvious arcane magics prevent this cirrus style cloud from
pulling away from its larger, lumpier neighbors.  The cloud quickly
dissipates to both the east and west, allowing a view of the ground far
below.  To fall off of this bridge would mean instant death, without
question.

Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all
directions, save south, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter
that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  The
clouds to the south are vaporously thin, offering a hazy view of the
countryside below.

Serene Sunshine~
Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all
directions, save south, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter
that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  The
clouds to the south are vaporously thin, offering a hazy view of the
countryside below.

Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous

Mimicking large boulders, jutting mountains and the rare valley the
cloud's surface billows out on its own accord.  These creations seem to
not last long, for as one forms another disappears, its matter fusing
into the cloud so it can burst forth to dance once more.

Serene Sunshine~
Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all four
cardinal directions, and yet in this cloud's ever-changing state, nothing
remains the same from moment to moment.

Serene Sunshine~
Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all
directions, save south, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter
that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  The
clouds to the south are vaporously thin, offering a hazy view of the
countryside below.

Serene Sunshine~
Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all
directions, save west, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter
that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  Though
seemingly rising up at a slight angle, the cloud appears more stable to
the west, billowing out and growing in size but not changing its overall
appearance.

Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all four
cardinal directions, and yet in this cloud's ever-changing state, nothing
remains the same from moment to moment.

Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all
directions, save north, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter
that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  Jutting
off to the north is what appears to be a perpetually stable cloud, its
size and appearance remains the same even as the clouds around it shift
and morph.

Unlike the cloud to the east, absolutly no transitioning appears to be
taking place on the solid cumulus cloud to the north.  No wispy tendrils
dance merrily about waiting for their forms to be added to the existing
cloud, instead that puffy white creation stands as a sentinal berift of
the vapourous tendrils so common elsewhere.  That non-changing cloud has
leeched itself to the side of the other by this singular connection
point, allowing travel between the two.  A small ascending path leads off
toward the south, the clouds edges dangerously close together...  nearly
to the point of forcing single-file passage.

Appearing as one solid mass, this small ascending path shows not a wisp
of cumulus matter out of place.  This skinny path is no larger than three
feet wide at its largest point.  A slight angle is evident towards the
south as it snakes its way through the sky, its apparent purpose to lead
passer-by's toward a much larger cloud to the southwest.  A slight view
is evident to either side of the small path, though no details can be
made through the thinning clouds...  to get a better look would entail
walking off the path and that could prove disasterous.

White as new-fallen snow the puffy cloud here has nearly entirely
coalesced into a solid substance, only the edges of the small path seem
thin enough to fall through.  A carefully sculpted turn in this ascending
path leads towards the west and a mass of cumulus material that fills the
sight from horizon to horizon in that direction.  The cloud here is not
acting as one would expect, neither moving nor changing shape but instead
remaining stagnant and purposeful much like a human built bridge spanning
the gap between the western and southern clouds.

Two statues, greater than twenty-five feet tall flank an incredibly large
entrance to the inside of the cloud to the west.  With each holding out a
still hand they appear as a welcoming party gesturing for you to enter
that larger than life parody of a cave.  The cave's surface is the same
as everything else surrounding it, made from the pure cumulus matter of
the clouds it appears as a puffy ball of white cotton with a large hole
perfectly set into its side.  A small, slightly descending path mimicking
the downward slope of a gentle hill leads to the east and away from the
entrance.
~
[Adakar] editors note...  guardians will be aggro evil and will attack
any good/neut group aftr they kill the dragon but not before.

The small pathway spills into a vast, domed chamber filled with more
treasure than any one room should ever contain.  This cloudy cave is lit
by the cumulus material itself it seems, filled with a soft diffused
white light that has no evident source.  The walls, ceiling and floor are
not smooth and hard but instead lumpy and soft; obviously they are still
more cloud than wall and only a great amount of arcane magick's could be
holding this chamber together.  The only egress from the room is a large
circular hole in the cloudy walls to the east, oddly it seems to be wider
than it is tall.
~
[Adakar] dragon here
[Adakar] don't worry, the dragon will destroy 99% of the treasure when it
dies..  prolly melting it into one giant pile that the players could
never hope to lift.

Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that

that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  The

#11049
Serene Sunshine~
Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all four
cardinal directions, and yet in this cloud's ever-changing state, nothing
remains the same from moment to moment.

Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same to both the south
and west, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter that though it
supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  The clouds to the north
and east are vaporously thin, offering a hazy view of the countryside
below.

is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all
directions, save east, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter
that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  The
clouds to the east are vaporously thin, offering a hazy view of the
countryside below.

Stretching forth from horizon to horizon is a pearlescent sterility that
is almost mind-numbing.  New formations billow out and bulge from the
surface of this gargantuan cumulus cloud; as each blossom erupts previous
ones dissipate and vanish.  Everything appears the same in all
directions, save east, a field of pillowy, ever-changing cumulus matter
that though it supports weight will not be easy to transgress.  The
clouds to the east are vaporously thin, offering a hazy view of the
countryside below.

Serene Sunshine~
Misty thin tendrils of cottony material drift throuth the air, slowly
melding with the ever-changing cloud to the south.  Nearly filling the
air above the somewhat-stable surface of the cumulus cloud the vaporous
tendrils coalesce into a faint archway leading toward the north.  Beyond
the arch, the very air itself is enshrouded in a thick fog of expanding
wisps that when combined make up the basis for this and every other cloud
in the sky.

As if filled with the smoke from a morning campfire visibility here is
all but nil.  Thick tendrils of cumulus matter drift through the air,
though not stifling like a dense fog but instead wrapping this small room
in a protective blanket that not even harsh light can pass through.  A
faint glow is evident, warming the air with its peach-colored light... 
its source the small altar set in the center of the visible surface.  The
dense fog seems to thin toward the south leaving the only apparant egress
away from the altar in that direction.

[Adakar] sigils.. will have to be an extra in the room i guess since oextras still don't work.
