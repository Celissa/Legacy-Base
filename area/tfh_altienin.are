The Room of Reflection~
Smooth, seamless pristine white stone forms the perimeter of this single,
broad circular room.  The centerpiece of the room, a wide reflecting pool
no more than a few inches deep, draws all attention to it and away from
the cares of the world outside.  Almost unnoticed, four sets of stairs
spiral their way up the inner perimeter of the walls wending their way up
to a higher room.  Set between each set of stairs, at the ordinal points
of the compass, four deep arches lined with arcane runes allow a gentle
breeze in from the world outside.

This is the base of the ivory spire.

refecting pool room 5 centerpiece~
The pool fills the bulk of the room leaving roughly half the floor space
available for other use.  The basin of the pool has been colored to a
midnight black turning the clear water into a nearly perfect mirror
casting reflections of everything above it back at the viewer.  Fragile
flower blossoms float lazily upon the pools surface adding delicate
touches of white and sky-blue to the otherwise crystal-clear water.

The pristine walls dominate the view for the most part.  The single
rune-lined arch is set into the wall and a small portion of grass-lined
courtyard outside can be seen from this angle, but nothing more.
~
E
5 stairs 1 up~
Each of the four sets of stairs starts just to the right of one of the
arches leading outside and continues to wind its way up the inside of the
tower walls in a clockwise direction.  No sign of stone or mortise is
visible and, like the walls themselves, the stairs appear to be of a
seamless construction.  Each set of stairs leads upward through an
opening in the ceiling to a warmly lit room overhead.

emage~
The runes look to be magical in nature, not clerical, and are most
definitely elven in origin.  Their exact purpose is lost in the
intricacies of their design but they seem to imply the focusing of
physical strength upon the nature of the building itself.

~
E
ecleric~
The runes aren't clerical in nature so perhaps they are magical in nature. 
Its as a fair chance they serve some nature, given their intricate and
deliberate design.  The only thing you can be certain about is that they
are elven in origin.

Library~
Bookshelves dominate the view forming the walls of a wide, circular room
and reaching from floor to ceiling.  The only break in these immense
shelves are at the four compass points where an arch leads to stairs
behind the bookshelves that wind their way up or down to other rooms. 
Low shelves measuring only three feet tall form five neat aisles that
meet in the center of the large room like the arms of a star.  At even
intervals along aisles low benches are set into the floor permitting a
reader place to read once they find what they seek.

Many low shelves, measuring only three feet in height, form the arcs of
several concentric circles working their way inwards towards the center
of the wide room.  A circular bench rests in the middle of the room
permitting readers a convenient place of repose as they study the
materials they have found.

Bookshelves dominate the view forming the walls of a wide, cirular room
and reaching from floor to ceiling.  The only break in these immense
sheves are at the four compass points where an arch lead out to balconies
or to stairs behind the bookshelves that wind their way up or down to
other rooms.  A few low benches are spaced along the rooms edge near the
massive shelves leaving a raised dais in the center of the room free of
clutter.  The only thing of note atop the dais, which would be hard to
miss given teh wide berth of space allotted to it, is a single tome
resting upon an ornate column measuring a scant three and a half feet in
height.

the hall of memory~
The smooth contour of the wall blends just as smoothly with both ceiling
and floor with bevelled edges that give the room an almost living feel. 
High windows provide only views of the sky, however, they seem to
admirably suite their purpose as they allow sunlight in daily to provide
nourishment for the many plants resting on columns and ledges around the
room.  Shallow alcoves run the entire perimeter of the circular room
providing housing for a plethora of tapestries depicting various scenes
of the woods.  Almost unseen among the carefully sculpted feel of the
room, sets of stairs wind their way both up and down out of the room.
~
need to use acode so each time the tapestries are viewed, a different one
is seen.
tapestries depict scenes of both old forest and new one as well as elven life and values.

then, behind you as you pass the periodically spaced glowing orbs that

Plaza of the Spire~
A @Wwhite tower@n forms the focal point for this large plaza of cobbled
walkways, manicured grasses and tended shrubs.  With the tower as its
center, the trimmed grasses are broken only by pathways cobbled with
water-smoothed stones that lead off to the north, east, south and west. 
The neatly trimmed shrubs form a series of low hedges that seem to lose
their obviously planned appearance at a distance and quickly blend in
with the surrounding foliage.  It would take hours to fully examine all
the greenery in sufficient detail to appreciate the delicate blend of
natural harmony and carefully planned aesthetics.

white tower spire~
The tower forms a pristine spire of white in the midst of the verdant
forest foliage.  There are no windows near the ground, in fact, the only
entrances seem to be a series of five foot tall arches in the tower's
base.  Further up the tower, perhaps a good seventy feet up, a set of
narrow balconies ring the tower at nearly its mid-way point.  Half again
higher up the tower, a few wide openings appear to finally be window
slits.  As their are no doors set in the arches it appears as if it would
be quite easy to @Genter@n the @Gtower@n.

North Castle Road~
This north-south cobbled road formed of water-rounded stones is nestled
amidst a small grove of trees.  The trees appear to be carefully tended,
forming blinds to the east and west behind which you occasionally can
make out sides of other buildings.  While there are no buildings with
entrances accessable to this point in the road, it looks like there are
intersections both north and south of here that may lead to buildings you
can reach.

Two roads of water-rounded stones intersect here where a spring feeds a
small fountain.  To the north, a wide archway rests in the smooth white
stone of what appears to be a keep wall.  Two heavy-set, mithril bound
oak doors stand ready to be closed in times of trouble, but stand open
now.  The roads themselves lead off to other parts of town to the east,
south and west.

Castle Foregate~
Smooth walls of seemless white stone form the perimeter of this green,
growing place that serves as the foregate to a grand castle of flowing
buttresses and shining spires.  A barely worn path splits the carefully
tended greenery on either side of you into two even swathes dotted with
color that offsets the austere castle walls.  Two heavy-set, mithril
bound oak doors mark the southern exit from the castle.  To the north a
smaller, but equally grand set of double-doors allow entrance into the
heart of the castle.

Grand Hall~
The flowing, white walls are broken by periodally spaced carved rosewood
beams placed for purely aesthetic purposes.  Between the beams, large,
colorful tapestries depict scenes of the city life and the forest.  A
plush, green carpet forms a path leading to a raised dais at the back of
the hall.  Two high-backed, ornate thrones are centered on the dais with
a smaller, yet no less ornate, throne on either side.  Two large arches,
one in the center of the east wall and one in the west, are framed in
seamless, dark wood.

3 tapestry tapestries~
The tapestries display scense of everyday life in the elven city of
Altienin and scenes of verdant woodland greenery.  The tapestries do not
appear to be magical in nature, but they are quite well crafted and the
images seem almost ready to move, as if you were looking out a window
rather than at a piece of woven cloth.  The city scenes are a wash of
bright elven colors set on the backdrop of woodland greens and smooth,
white elven houses.  The forest scenes are subtle variations of greens,
browns, golds, and yellows touched with small patches of wold-flower
colors.  Taken in all together they have been carefully arranged so that
you could almost believe you stand in the midst of a wall-less buiding
rather than the great hall of a large castle.
~
E
3 beams~
The rosewood beams, as seamless as any other bit of elven-constructed
wood furniture, seems somehow more grand for its carefully smooth surface. 
No sign of its carefully tended growth remains and it would be easy to
think it had been planed with tools.  Given that this is the palace of
the queen and king of all the elves it would be extremely unlikely metal
would ever be permitted to touch any wood here.

Castle Dining Hall~
A natural spring from deep in the earth has been channeled upwards until
it falls like a waterfall from high on the eastern wall.  The burbling
springwater makes its way down a series of artfully placed troughs and
rivulets that wind their way along the walls of the entire room,
Shade-loving plants have been set in little nooks along the wall giving
the room nearly the feel of a natural forest glade.

West Timber Road~
This east-west cobbled road formed of water-rounded stones is nestled
amidst a small grove of trees.  The trees appear to be carefully tended,
forming blinds to the north and south behind which you can occasionally
make out the backs or sides of other buildings.  While none of the
buildings have entrances accessable to this point in the road, it looks
like other buildings further west and further east do.

The building to the north is most notable of the three if only because it
has a door set in its entry-arch whereas the ones to the west and south
do not.

The White Hart Tavern~
The large, main room is filled with eight broad tables, each with a bench
lining its long sides.  A curving counter forms a ledge along the far
wall upon which rests all the ales and brews the barkeep has for sale. 
Back in one corner a set of stairs is carved into the wall rising quickly
into a hole cut in the ceiling to a room above.
~
I will add a chance that some of the townsfolk pop here as patrons later.
Also plan on adding some tales for flavor once the city is placed in its
setting and nearby locations can be included.
Also will have a story about his scar one ity is placed.

This single-room structure appears to be the dwelling of a small family. 
A single table rests against one wall with chairs nearby.  Towards the
far wall from the door, three pallets are made up for sleeping.  Two are
larger and one smaller, perhaps indicating the presence of a child.  A
single chest rests near one of the two larger raised pallets, quite
probably a place to store things at night.

Smooth, white walls form the permiter of this simple building that serves

is covered in a perplexing array of beakers, jars, vials and bowls.  A
small hearth is set into one wall and a low fire burns keeping several
small cauldrons simmering.  A small pallet in the back looks as if it may
serve as a resting place for the alchemist on long nights when her
concoctions require continueous attention.

Elven House~
The ornate workmanship displayed in this dwelling would seem to indicate
that its owner is a being of means.  A wardrobe stands against one wall,
its surface covered in fluid curves that form the leaves and branches of
trees.  Slightly away from the wall opposite the wardrobe a single chair
stands before a well-organized desk.  Most opulent of all, a bed rests
within a wooden framework, surrounded by gauzy silk curtains dyed to a
deep cerulean color.

Sylvan Savings~
The austere white walls typical of Altienin buildings are covered here in
a flowing silver script or arcane runes.  Even the glowing balls of
magical light are absent from this place, replaced instead by more
mundane braziers that emit a soft light and subtle scent.  Its almost as
if something, the runes in the walls perhaps, focus any magic cast here
towards some other ends.  A note, written in elvish script, rests on the
only small table here.

West Plaza Road~
A cobbled road of water-rounded stones forms a natural looking walkway
leading east and west.  To the north, a small, rounded building of
seamless white stone rests with no door on it to bar entry.  A few small
trees line either side of the house, their green foliage and its
green-hued roof blending together in a way that would make it hard to
spot from above.

West Plaza Road~
This east-west cobbled road formed of water-rounded stones is nestled
amidst a small grove of trees.  The trees appear to be carefully tended,
forming blinds to the north and south behind which you occasionally can
make out the backs or sides of other buildings.  While none of the
buildings have entrances accessable to this point in the road, it looks
like other buildings further west and further east do.

Temple to Tairae~
The first thing to grab your attention as you enter will always be the
magnificent stone altar of Tairae that dominates the back wall of this
large room.  The image of Tairae, imposed over a crescent moon, coolly
watches over those who enter his domain.  A gentle, silver glow that
seems to come from everywhere and nowhere, keeps the temple list and
shadowless at all times.  The white walls of the building are covered in
places with magic sript as if the entire room were one, giant written out
spell for someone with the knowledge to comprehend it all.
~
Temple altar is here (altar.good)
Whole temple is sacred and marked Safe

This is the SHOW temple for visitors and lay folk.
the REAL temple is further up.

Acodes 3 and 4 for walls and brown require that the cleric response only
work for members of the religion.

Script/spell on the wall will be part of a big quest for the temple.

altar tairae statue marble back~
Tairae, depicted in his usual form as a tall, elven man, appears dressed
in a loose-fitting, flowing silk tunic, smooth breeches, and high, boots,
stands before a large, silver crescent moon, rimmed with ie and trailing
a shower of silvery sparks.  A smooth, clear circlet of what appears to
be actual ice rests upon the silver-veined marble statue's brow, holding
his straight, shoulder-length hair out of his face.  Just below the icy
circlet is inscribed a script of runes that give off a faint silvery,
magical glow.  Tairae's face shows the classic elven aloofness as he
coolly stares out of his charges, watching over them.

The flowing script on the walls has the look of the fragments of the
oldest of old-world spells.  Its fluid arcs and graceful symmetry seems
somehow beyond the level of most spells remaining to the world.  It is a
thing of ancient beauty and deep mystery that has caused many a mage and
true follower of Tairae to tremble in awe-filled humility.

The script seems to form a single, word in the magical tongue, however,
it isn't one you've seen used anywhere else.  Perhaps it is some sort of
spell linked to the statue?  The word it spells out is '@MChimrus@n'.
~
E
cleric~
You recognize the word as one from the teachins of your faith.  It is a
magical word that a follower of Tairae, or anyone skilled in the more
esoteric arts of magic, can use to call forth Tairae's judgement within
certain temples of his.
~
E
clueless~
Looks like it may be magical in nature but you can't be certain.  Its a
pretty good educated guess though since this is the temple to the god of
magic and the word is written on the brow of a statue of the god of magic.

The austere white walls of this place have been brightened with drapes of
multi-hued cloths in various stages of transformation into fine clothing. 
In stark contrast to the vibrant cloths, three wardrobes shaded brown so
dark as to be almost black provide a dust-free environment for the final
products.  Completing the tableau, a plush carpeting covers the floor in
a striking safron hue.

briefly with your movements.

being worked on in the interim.  Amidst a few storage crates stacked in

The Armorsmith's Wing~
The gray walls, normally a pristine white, are a testament to the amound
of work done at the forge set into the north wall.  Several anvils of
varying size and shape mark out different work areas in the room, each
with unfinished bits of armor awaiting completion nearby.  Almost hidden
behind a cluster of tools and sheets of metal waiting to be forged, you
can just see a couple troughs used in quenching and tempering the various
armors made.

5 anvils~
Some of the anvils are small, obviously meant for small, detailed work. 
Other anvils in the room range from a mix of sizes all the way up to one
large one that would probably take two strong vodekyn to even move it. 
Some of have pritchet holes, used for punching holes through the armor,
while others have are smooth topped or have shaped surfaces condusive to
the curves being put into various armors.
~
E
unfinished 3 bits armor~
None of the unfinished armor bits are in a state to be of use at this
point.  Most are nothing more than vaguely shaped metal sheets and
perhaps some did not take well to some aspect of the smithing or
tempering and are awaiting normalization before they can be reforged. 
One piece looks vaguely like it will become a kite shield, but a flaw in
the metal so obvious that even a layman can see it seems to indicate it
would be of no use either.

The Weaponsmith's Wing~
The ever-present crackling fire contained in the forge on the south wall
throws off a thin smoke that has tinted the normally pristine white walls
a dingier shade.  A variety of tools hang from the walls, some looking
more ominous than others, but all giving the appearance that every item
is carefully stowed where it belongs when not in use.  The only items
seeming, perhaps, out of place may be the metal bars waiting to be shaped
into swords that lean against one of the anvils.  Leaning against one of
the troughs near the forge, a single oddly shaped metal with flaring
edges looks suspiciously like it may be awaiting its turn to become the
head of a battle-axe.

4 tools~
The tools consist primarily of hammers of varying sizes and shapes,
although a few of the sharper implements and pincer-like tongs do have a
more sinister look to them.  Although a person could conceivably learn to
use them as a weapon, most do not look of a quality to provide anywhere
near the same level of combat-usage as the items they are being used to
craft.
~
E
3 bars metal~
Most are relatively long strips of metal measuring about two-four inches
across and perhaps an inch thick.  Some have the rudimentary shape of a
sword tang hammered into them, but none are near enough the completion
stage to be functional yet.
~
E
battle-axe axe flaring~
A wide strip of metal unlike the crude sword-shapes, this piece obviously
isn't awaiting its turn to become a sword.  In this crude form, it is
obviously far from easily identifiable and its likely the smith hasn't
even truly begun working on it at all.  The general size and shape,
however, do lend themselves well to imagination that this may easily
serve as the starting point for the blades of a battle-axe or, perhaps,
the head of a polearm.

Helpful Herbs~
An assortment of drying herbs hang from rafters set into the stone
ceiling almost giving it the appearance of a garden growing in reverse. 
Below these hanging herbs, mostly along the walls, several units of
shelves house bins and bottles of dried herbs and seeds.  A small, stone
hearth set into the back wall serves for drying herbs and warming salves
as needed.

The shelves hold a variety of bins and bottles in many shapes and colors. 
There are even a few wooden cabinets whose bases, and sometimes even

determining how the herbs have all been sorted, it is not readily

Elven House~
This dwelling exhibits the epitomy of orderliness with everything
precisely in its place.  Four simple beds are evenly aligned along the
far wall from the entry door.  At the foot of each bed, a small chest
rests, waiting to hold the day-to-day items carried around by each bed's
owner.  Nearer the door rests a simple, yet functional, table easily
large enough to seat five or six elves.  Finally, off to one side of the
door in the remaining available space, stand two neatly organized desks.

Pendaylen's Clothcuttery~
Several tables littered with scraps of cloth take up the bulk of the room
giving it a somewhat cluttered feel.  The remnants of several bolts of
various colored cloth are leaned against the wall, still wrapped around
wooden frames used to transport them.  In spite of the clutter, or
perhaps because of it, the room has a warm, lived-in feel.

South Castle Road~
You are on a north-south bound road of water-smoothed cobbled stones. 
Small growth trees and carefully sculpted shrubbery form a colorful
display beneath the canopy of the higher trees that would probably
conceal the view from above.  On either side of the road a small, rounded
white building rests, however, the one to the east has no door set in its
entry arch giving it a much more inviting appearance.

Intersection of Castle Road and Arbor Lane~
Two cobbled roads cross here leading off in the four cardinal directions. 
Four large oaks grow at the corner-peices of the crossroads, shading the
entire area beneath wide boughs that start high overhead.  At the heart

its trickling waters to the calm of the shaded intersection in the midst

Two buildings in partiular, one to the east and another to the west with

South Castle Road~
A cobbled road formed from broad, flat water-tumbled stones begins just
south of here and stretches away to the north.  On either side of the
road stands an ivory-white tower that extends across overhead to meet the
other, forming an arch that looms over the road.  A rather formidable
looking portcullis set into the arch shows no signs of rust and every
sign of careful maintenance, ready to be used in times of trouble. 
Despite the militant look of the city's defenses, the look and feel of
the area is softened by the many colorful wildflowers that grow along the
base of the towers and the frequent sound of bubbling laughter.

Acodes 1 and 2 are for the city gates once I determine how I want to

The building to the north is most notable of the three if only because it
has a door set in its entry-arch whereas the ones to the west and south

its leafy branches sheltering the buildings from sight overhead.

The smell of fresh heather is strong in this simple dwelling apparently
coming from the newly stuffed, double-wide wooden pallet resting at the
base of the northern wall.  A wide wardrobe with four wooden drawers is
set against the eastern wall, an extravagence in such a simple setting. 
The only other furniture in the room is a low table set a small distance
off of the western wall.  Four woven-rush mats rest on the floor about
the table indicating, along with its low height, that its users are meant
to be seated on the floor around it rather than in chairs or benches.

The pallet seems wide enough for two occupants to comfortably rest in. 
Given the elven nature of spartan homes and their usual custom of
sleeping on individual pallets, this must have been quite a concession to
two unusual elves.  The wood of the pallet is still very fresh-looking
and seamlessly formed of one piece as if grown rather than onstructed. 
Fresh heather rushes have been used for the bedding and their scent fills
the room.

The smells of cured leather, sticky glues and fresh polishes fill the air
of this small building.  Set against the white walls are several rows of
wooden shelves each filled with the scraps of previous works or bits and
pieces of works in progress.  A wooden counter, its top scarred from
years of use for tacking soles onto shoes, stands just off center of the
buildings floor serving as both workplace and display platform for the
shops proprietor.  Scratches on the floor behind the counter show where
chairs have rested for years allowing the shop keeper a place to rest or

Despite the plethora of herbs hanging from the ceiling, a closer
inspection shows them to be common woodland plants of little or no value. 
They make a fine display but are obviously not the sort of thing a shop

more than a pleasant-looking display for window-dressing.

The surfae of the wooden counter bears thousands of little cris-crossing
mars from years of choping, slicing, pounding and dicing herbs on its

proprietor.  The small hearth looks just big enough to hold two or three
small kettles or cauldrons, or perhaps one medium-sized cauldron for
cooking were the fire ablaze.

The Wayfarer's Rest~
Six broad, oaken tables, each with a long bench on either side, fill the
bulk of the rooms common area spaced evenly around a central hearth.  The
central hearth, easily measuring four feet across, is a circular
conglomeration of water-smoothed stones mortared together to hold coals
for cooking and warmth in colder seasons.  White, stone steps are carved
into the back wall of the tavern leading up into a shadowy room overhead. 
Two large tapestries Cover the walls on either side perpendicular to the
stairs and entrance, one a deep woodland scene, the other a city of some
kind.
~
I want one of the tapestries to have a "map" of one of the main human
towns on it, but I need to look over the town first.  incomplete map, but
enough to be recognizable to one who frequents that town.
Dun T maybe...  need to ask Eliza/Usiel for a layout of map fragment.

3 tapestry tapestries~
There are two tapestries, a @Gwoodland@n tapestry and a @Ycity@n
tapestry, which would you like to inspect?
~
E
woodland~
The woodland tapestry depicts a verdant scene typical of the deep forest. 
Trees of unusually wide girth, shuvana trees, seem to comprise the bulk
of the forest depicted, dwarfing an ancient oak included sufficiently to
make it look young by comparison.  In the foreground the image depicts a
satyr playing pipes before a cadre of nymphs dancing about a
butterfly-bedecked woodland spring.  It is a joyous scene laden with
vibrant colors and the imagry of the fae.
~
E
city~
The city tapestry seems to be depited as if one were standing atop a
tower overlooking a portion of the city below it.  The city streets,
sometimes partially obscured by roof tops, are none-the-less fairly easy
to observe at this angle.  Strange, round-eared people that could only be
humans walk the streets mingling with each other beneath the brightly
colored signs of shops in what appears to be a market district.

East Arbor Lane~
This east-west cobbled road formed of water-rounded stones is nestled
amidst a small grove of trees.  The trees appear to be carefully tended,
forming blinds to the north and south behind which you can occasionally
make out the backs or sides of other buildings.  While none of the
buildings have entrances accessable to this point in the road, it looks
like other buildings further west and further east do.

East Arbor Lane~
You are at the extreme east end of a cobbled road that extends away to
the west.  Three rounded, white buildings stand up against the road's
edge, their entrances all available to this point.  While the buildings
to the north and east have simple open arches leading inside, the one to
the south distinguishes itself with the glitter of gems set above its
arch.  A broad-boughed maple tree forms the centerpoint of this
cul-de-sac, its colorful red leaves forming just one of the many splashes
of color in the woodland canopy overhead.

Fiscavien's Fine Clothing~
Several ledges are the resting place for carefully folded bolts of
fabric, pots of dye, and other assorted tailoring needs when the shop's
keeper is present to tend them.  Two racks lean against the far wall,
unfinished fabrics in various stages of completion awaiting the tailor's
return.  A rough, dress-makers dummy is bolted to a heavy stand in one
corner of the building awaiting use during the clothier's next masterful
task.  Only one section of wall space is cleared leaving room for three
full-length mirrors that permit customers to view themsleves from head to
foot.  Hanging just over the mirrors, a small brazier emits a gentle
floral scent that gives the room a pleasant smell.

The Arbor Inn~
Several friendly-looking tables and benches stand around the room
providing customers with a place to set down food and drink and rest.  A
broad counter stands near one wall, a place for the barkeep and cook to
work behind as she cooks up food and serves drinks.  A pleasant-looking
tapestry hangs behind the counter, depicting a forest scene and several
more like it are spaced on the walls around the room.

counter~
The counter is made from several slabs of carefully crafted and cured
thick, oak wood.  Years of use have rounded its sharp edges and given it
an almost homely appearance.  The stains of countless circles form an
intricately random pattern on its surface where mugs and cups alike have
rested over the years.

4 tapestry tapestries~
The tapestries depict various scenes of the local forest life ranging
from a nice view to one filled with animals caught in the act of running
and flying.  The one behind the barkeep's counter depicts a grove of
large, smooth-barked trees unlike any in the nearby woods.

The Chiming Crystal~
The pristine white walls only occasionally show through between the
numerous glass-fronted display cases mounted there.  A large display
counter runs the length of the room, its glass top lit by several glowing
magic balls that hover in intricate patterns above it.  A single chair
sits behind the counter, a place for the custodean to rest between
customers rests behind the counter.  Behind the chair even, an elegant
spiral staircase of polished silver metal leads up through a small
opening in the roof.

This shop is FAR from complete.  Complete, means it will have MORE

Elven House~
The typically spartan nature of elven decor is far from evident in this
disheveled domecile.  Two wooden bookshelves stand on either side of a
cluttered plank that seems to be serving as a desk.  Before the makeshift
desks stands a simple, sturdy-looking wooden chair.  Pushed to one side
of the room is a narrow bed, straw sticking out from its coverlets. 
Getting to any of these things may turn out to be a bit of a chore, given
the ample mounds of wax and odd chalk runes and symbols covering the
floor and walls.
~
some quest involved here at some future point as well.  -teircen 
(I have some ideas, but I'm holding off to tie it in to a nice large
quest) 

Need to add the "browse" and "search" function for these bookshelves.
As well as several "fluff" books to fill random tales into for space issues.
An extra for the books will be included in the acode that loads the books.

bed~
The bed is no more than a simple wooden pallet with a straw-filled
mattress resting upon it.  It is just about four feet long, big enough
for an elf, easily, but only about two feet wide.  It doesn't appear to
get too much attention, as the mattress is very compressed and
threadbare with straw poking out in several places.
~
E
bookshelf bookshelves~
The two bookhelves are made of a single piece of wood each and look to be
quite old.  They are a matched set, readily appearant in the way the vine
carvings that climb their sides mirror each other.  Each stands an even
six feet tall and has shelves stuffed full of books in a variety of
sizes, conditions, and colors.
~
E
symbols runes~
The symbols and runes are carfeully drawn in a chalky powder but many
show signs of scuff marks, as if they were older and unused recently. 
The lumps of wax indicate the usage of candles both inside circles and
out as well as near and afar from various obscure symbols.  Most of the
remaining runes appear to have a magical sort of context to them, though
in their present state you can't really tell what they were to begin with.
~
E
5 mounds wax~
None of the wax mounds remaining present even the working stub of a
candle and some actually have small circular depressions in the middle
where the remains of a candle must have been removed for later use.  Most
are a shade of green or blue, though there are also occurance of white,
yellow or a mottled combination of all the colors in various places. 
Most are encrusted near the sweeping arcs of circles, both within and
without the circles but some are near the remains of chalky runes left on
the floor.
~
E
desk~
The desk is a cluttered mess of mangled quills, hastily scribbled
illegible parchment, and even a few spilled sand-pots leaving pearlescent
sands scattered across the workspace.  A blackened cork rests on its side
in a little puddle of dried ink near an inkwell, long since dried up.  To
one side, clear of sands and stains, a space has been cleared, as if
whatever was there was removed after the mess was left behind.  If
anything of use was here before, it is gone now.

Uluvien's Quickie Mart~
Four aisles are delineated by four foot shelves.  Elves hate these
shelves as they can't see over them, but the shelves do easily provide
ample storage space for the plethora of twinkies, ding-dongs, and ho-ho's
that form the staple of the late night elven gamer.  While most of the
aisles are at least mostly stocked, the chips aisle is fairly depleted
and the cheetos are completely gone.  A quick glance at the magically
refrigerated beverage aisle shows that it has also been hit hard and the
stock is low.  Must be a game somewhere in elf-town tonight.

real room description~
Room Name: Uluvien's Fresh Fruit

A variety of bushels and bins are neatly organized to display the
shop-keepers wares of the day, presumably fresh fruits from the images
depicted on some of the bushels.  Towards the rear of the shop, a corner
has been clear for a small table and space enough for a chair to be
comfortably used to provide a working place for the shop keeper between
customers.  Unlike many other shops, its apparant the proprietor does not
live here but, rather, uses this building only for a place of work.  A
clear indicator that the shop is doing well and the wares of good quality
if the proprietor can afford two seperate locations, one for living and
another for selling.

Elven House~
The single wooden pallet in one corner of the room marks this as the
dwelling of a solitary elf.  The lone occupant, although absent right
now, seems to retain more the usual elven taste for spartan decor.  A
slight discoloration at the foot of the pallet marks where a chest
usually stands but the owner seems to have moved it to a new location
relatively recently.  The only other furniture in the building is a
wooden table lacking even a chair for the sake of comfort.

Al'Katriel's General Supply~
A functional and relatively elegant display counter seems to be the most
prominent bit of furniture in this building despite its being set to the
side as you enter.  Set against the far wall, with a clear view of the
entryway, a workmans bench provides both seat and work area for any
projects the shop keeper undertakes.  Leaning against the wall next to
the workbench is a wooden ladder leading up into an overhead room.  Given
the extra space alloted to this lower room for larger races, such as
vodekyn, the overhead room can't have much headway.  Its an likely guess
that it is either a storage room, sleeping space or, perhaps, both.

Guard Tower~
The tower presents a fairly stark appearance with no tapestries here to
soften the blank walls.  A tall, arching portal set in the eastern wall
provides a clear view of the sally port that allows admittance into the
city making the it easier for the guards to identify friend and foe.  The
room's plain appearance, lacking even stools for the guards to sit on,
speaks of its only functional use as a guard tower.  White stone stairs
are cut into the austere white walls providing passage higher into the
tower.
~
guard should prevent those who have not proven themselves friends of the
elves from heading up into the guard rooms.
Will have a quest to be proven a friend of the civil guard for elves. 
And a pre-quest for non-elves to be proven a friend of the elves first
perhaps?

Guard Tower~
The stark white walls are broken by evenly spaced tapestries depicting
scenes of new forest growth in various shades green around the curve of
the tower.  The central area of the tower is cleared and marked off to
provide a small sparring area for use during inclement weather.  A wide
cabinet with two wide doors, carefully constructed to fit the curvature
of the tower, fills the northern wall.  A rounded arch leads to a larger
room to the east and a stairwell along the outer wall spirals down into
the lower recesses of the tower.
~
I'd like to have a reputation modifier for anyone stealing from cabinet.

Arms master will have quests added later.

4 tapestries tapestry 3 walls lush forest growth~
The tapestries depict the scenes of forest growth that run in many shades
of green associated with new forest growth in early to mid spring.  Here
and there small, colorful wildflowers are woven into the tapestry adding
subtle touches of color that enhance the overall effect.  While the
scenes are unspecific enough to bear a resemblance to any specific
location in a forest, the composition of plants makes it easy to tell
that these are probably representative of the Sylfaen wood that surrounds
the city.

Guard Tower~
The stark white walls are broken by evenly spaced tapestries depicting
lush green forest growth around the curve of the tower.  Crates stacked
around the room seem to indicate that this is some sort of storage room,
however, several have been arranged to double as seats and tables
indicating that the room also serves the guards in their off duty time. 
A rounded arch leads to a larger room to the west and a stairwell along
the outer wall spirals down into the lower recesses of the tower.

Guard Tower~
The long narrow room looks more like a widened hall then a proper room. 
Two large chains run, set on the western edge of the south-facing wall
and one in the eastern edge, run from holes in the floor up further
through holes in the ceiling, a part of the portcullis mechanism.  Narrow
windows, nothing more than arrow slits really, are intermittently spaced
along the north and south walls.  Two large arches allow easy access to
towers east and west of here.

The arrow slits are used as a defensive firing position for archers

Observatory~
The tower roof measures a score of feet across, a scant fraction of its
width at its base.  Acting as the city's focal point, the tower appears
to stand amidst a small clearing with only an occasional tree nearby. 
Just outside the city's perimeter the forest proper begins in earnest. 
Careful planning has allowed this tower to stand just above the level of
the treeline allowing an unimpeded view of the horizon and the great dome
of the celestial heavens.  A single trapdoor in the center of the floor
permits entry back into the tower.
~
still need telescope code for what people see while using it
general: trees, bird
at night: constalations (check weather first), season output?
Also need extra desc for the runes on it.

The White Hart Tavern~
Dim balls of light cast a soft glow on walls that curve suddenly inward
to form a dome that crests at a mere six feet from the floor.  Several
pallets of straw and blankets as well as a few cots form neatly ordered
rows that would comfortably provide resting places for about sixteen
people.  A hole in the floor leads to a set of stairs cut from the tavern
walls and appears to be the only normal way out of here.

The loft is a rather cramped, little space obviously not meant for people
to move around in.  Amidst a few crates and containers of various goods
and supplies, a small pallet drawn up of a pine bough stuffed matt
provides the shop keeper a place of rest.  The low roof, topping at about
three feet in height, makes it a rather uncomfortable place for just
about anyone.

Barren white walls form the foundation for whatever structure rests
overhead through a slim trap-door barely noticable in the roof.  Layers
of cobwebs hang in loose strands, as if someone had only recently parted
them.  The shattered remains of thoroughly searched and ravaged wooden
crates or shelving emits an unclean odor of must giving the impression
the damage must have all happened long ago.

The Fairy Workshop~
The low ceiling is cramped, even for your average sized dwarves and
gnomes, but the furniture in side is so small to make the room look
normal to scale.  Several small wooden benches rest before equally small
anvils that glitter like mithril, but probably aren't.  Next to each of
the work-benches stands a single perch, a possible resting place for a
bird or some other small avian creature.  A single little hearth-forge in
the center of the room is giving off a strong heat, but little smoke. 
What little smoke that is created quickly disipates through one of the
several small windows, too small to do more than look through, around the
room.  The only other exit is a small, spiral stairwell leading down
through the floor.

need to make the attack and hp of fairies and birds meet the mob standards

maybe I should make a perch "chair" object that fits only sizes smaller
than player races.  -t

5 anvils~
They are a tiny anvil in every respect proportioned to your normal-sized
ones.  Though they glitter like mithril, polished to a silvery-blue
sheen, they probably aren't.  In any case, they are securely adhered to
the floor with glittering nails that could only mean some sort of magic
is involved as well.
~
E
5 perches~
The perches are simple constructs of wood with a crosspiece meant for a
bird, or some similar creature, to perch upon while not in flight.  While
fine for small birds, the fragile wooden perch would be of no use to
anyone larger than a small sparrow.

The Arbor Inn~
The common sleeping area of the Arbor Inn is typical of most elven
communal buildings.  Several sleeping pallets are neatly aranged,
providing a small area of personal space to seperate each of the sleepers. 
Unlike most elven buildings, however, there are a few larger pallets
sized to suit even visiting vodekyn.  The simple white walls are muted to
a near grey from the subdued light cast by the nearly-spent balls of
magical light that hover near the ceiling.

The Wayfarer's Rest~
Dim balls of light cast a soft glow on walls that curve suddenly inward
to form a dome that crests at a mere six feet from the floor.  A stone
column in the center of the room that feeds heat from the hearth
downstairs into this sleeping area in cooler months.  A dozen pallets of
straw and blankets radiate out away from the central hearth-column to
provide comfortable resting places for occupants of the inn.  A hole in
the floor leads to a set of stairs cut from the tavern walls and appears
to be the only normal way out of here.

Al'Katriel's sleeping chamber~
A low ceiling makes the room cramped, requiring even an elf to hunch over
a bit.  A straw pallet rests well away from the narrow opening in the
floor through which a ladder descends.  In one corner near the rooms only
exit a broken old crate, no longer useful as a container, may serve as a
sort of small table or perhaps is the only remainder of a sign that the
room may have once been a storage vault.
