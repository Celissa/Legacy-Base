Reviwer stuff - not a real room~
'3434, 100% repop?  not sure that is a good idea really..silence is quite
nice 
the mob uses the item in his attack code, will give him a death prog to trash the item to lower its reset.
##### mob stuff
'2301 still high, but should be doable now ;)
the essences should probably have no corpse.
fixed
'2309 uses dice rolls in dam_message and inflict, will get weird looking results

Along the Wall~
A dry and beaten bed of brown grass, long dead, recedes from growing
patches of desolate dirt.  Rising prominently from the lifeless field, a
black marble structure lies northward, wickedly grinning gargoyles
encircling its ebon roofline.  To the south, the arid plot ends abruptly
at the base of the earthen-hued stone of the walls.  East lies the corner
of the outer battlements, and west a small grove of ancient oaks.

Along the Wall~
The vast field of brown grass, long since dead, ends abruptly a handful
of inches from the black marble wall rising to the north, as though
loathe to touch its polished surface.  Leering gargoyles encircle the
roofline, silent sentinels over all they survey.  Southward, the outer
barrier of the compound, composed of earthen-hued stone, looms forever
skyward, untouched by time and weather.  A clump of towering oaks lies
westward and eastward lies the eastern stronghold wall.

Along the Wall~
Bordered by a dark marble wall to the north and an earthen-hued stone
barrier to the south, the field of dead and drying grass runs eastward to
the corner and westward toward the compound gates.  Wickedly grinning
gargoyles ring the roofline of the marble structure, staring outward with
wary, unblinking eyes.

Beneath the Golden Dome~
The destruction so rampant throughout the rest of the compound is barely
evident in this beautifully elegant foyer.  Doors of purest white marble
inlaid with gold open to the north, though many of the precious gemstones
which once adorned them have been pried away.  Plush carpets cushion your
steps, the sapphirene color only slightly stained with dirt and grime. 
Golden walls rise to a high, vaulted ceiling, the dome of which is
inscribed with intricate murals, telling tales of glorious days all but
forgotten in the mists of time.  The elegant, flowing script so prominent
on the outside of the building covers the golden walls here as well, the
runes themselves a finer work of art than many paintings.  Arches carved
of gold mark entry to rooms to the east and west, while to the south
stretches a plush hallway.

A towering arch of gold forms the entrance to the north, the metal
beautifully carved with unicorns, dragons, and many other fantastic
creatures.  The doors themselves are formed of two immense slabs of solid
marble, as white as new-fallen snow.  An inlay of gold forms an elegant
script on the marble, though in several places, the gold has been
forcibly stripped away.  The doors are pitted in many places, and most of
the gemstones that once augmented the delicate filigree carvings have
been pried out, leaving only gaping holes.

The dome appears to be a work of perfection, molded from the very finest
gold and jewels.  Inlaid with colorful artworks and intricate designs of
gold and marble, its elaborate details are truely magnificent.  The
different friezes crafted upon the vaulted dome seem to descrbie stories
long since forgotten in the mists of time with their thousands of tiny
images.
~
E
script~
Beautiful, flowing script has been neatly carved into much of the
wall-space, serving both utilarian and decorative purposes.  The script
here appears very similar in form to that covering every available inch
of the golden outside walls of the library, having the same elegant lines
and flowing curves.  The meaning of the archaic script is long-forgotten,
but one thing is quite clear: these carvings have a definite meaning,
something more than a simple story.  An occasional faint gleam of power
illuminates the script in a brief, silver-hued glow, though this seems to
vanish almost as fast as it appears.

Crushed Gravel Pathway -- Near a Pair of Towering Statues~
Standing in the open, damp air of the massive complex, a quick glance
around provides a true perspective of the actual vastness contained
within the enclosed walls of this compound.  The crushed gravel path that
winds its way around the compound breaks in all four directions here. 
The compound's northern gate and surrounding wall are visible a short
distance away, and the western wall is even closer.  A pair of towering
black statues stand close by to the southeast, their craftsmanship truly
exquisite.

1 north 1 east 1 south 1 west walls~
Towering high to the north and west, the confining walls of the compound
seem impenetrable from this perspective.  The southern and eastern walls
are obscured behind buildings and structures that have been constructed
within the vast complex.  Providing no glimpse of the outside world, the
lowering sky is all that remains visible on the other side of the
citadel's walls.
~
E
towering black statues~
A few yards to the southeast, two menacing black statues rise from the
earth, crafted with every detail in mind.  Facial features or real detail? 
It is hard to distinguish between the two; although it is obvious to
anyone who has seen statues before that there is @esomething@n present. 
At first glance, a soft red glow seems to emanate from them, and the
first thing that comes to mind is unbridled heat, but after a blink or
two, the red glow does not seem to be there, questioning if it ever was.

Along the Wall~
Here in the southeastern corner of the compound, walls lie to the south
and east.  Chiseled expertly into the eastern wall, a narrow stairway
leads directly to the top of the ramparts.  A creeping vine, the only
life among a field of dead or dying grass, edges its way up the
staircase, its claw-like protrusions digging into the walls for support.
Vast fields of dry, brown vegetation stretch both to the north and
westward back toward the crystalline gates.

Expertly crafted into the walls of the compound, the stairway rises

its claw-like protrusions digging into the nearly non-existent seams of

Along the Wall~
The strip of land, a field of dead grass, lies sandwiched between an
earthen-vibrant colored wall and a building of black marble as dark as
the midnight sky.  The only vibrant color comes from a few, green,
creeping vines that are slowly crawling their way up the outer wall.  A
row of gargoyles lines the roof of the building to the west, carved
directly out of the silver-veined, black marble.  The strip of dying
vegetation continues towards the corner of the compound to the south, and
deeper into the stronghold to the north.

Along the Wall~
Large, crisscrossing fissures riddle the earthen-colored outer wall of
the compound.  Although it appears to have taken quite a pounding at some
point in the past, the wall remains standing, its ramparts structurally
sound, although weaker, than at any other point.  A large crater has
destroyed part of the field to the west, leaving a gaping wound in the
earth.  Resting within the exact center of this deep pit lies a heavy 
boulder of massive size.

crisscrossing fissures walls stone outer ramparts~
This portion of the earthen-colored, outer walls shows stress fractures
across its entire surface.  While each of these are small, it seems clear
that a powerful force was slammed against the wall here, perhaps during a
long-past seige on the compound.  The wall still seems sound despite
these minor cracks, perhaps due to the forces of magic used to create
them.
~
E
crater gaping wound west heavy boulder~
The boulder cradled within the gaping crater must weight several hundred
pounds.  Only a heavy, seige engine could have thrown a projectile this
size over the ramparts, and probably accounts for the fissure-riddled
wall to the east.

Tower Foyer~
Hollowed out from a single piece of ivory, burn marks and the dark stains
of dried blood mar the translucent stone, causing it to glow an evil
crimson in the ambient light.  A spiral stairway, chipped and damaged,
rises from the floor, curving around itself sinuously on its journey
upward.  There is no support pillar the structure, and the railings seem
more serpent-like as they coil through the air, than pieces of cold, hard
stone.  A dimly glowing rune pulses a malignant purple at about chest
height.

Courtyard - Before an Ivory Tower~
Pearlescent ivory walls now stained with soot, rise far into the sky,
seemingly without end from so close to the base.  Not a seam can be seen
in the tower's stone, but scratches and scorch marks reach roughly twenty
feet up its walls.  Above the darkened soot line, the alabaster tower
still rises unscathed.  The seamless construction gives the strong
impression that the whole of it was created through a great expenditure
of arcane power.  Looking closer, a dimly glowing rune pulses angrily at
about chest level, a malignant purple.

Courtyard - Before a Guildhall~
Great trees soar overhead, limbs outstretched but no longer clothed in
lush, green leaves.  Hazy light attempts to filter through the bare
branches, yet the courtyard still seems eternally shrouded in shadows. 
Once-fine embroidered banners hang from the tree's lower reaches, and
flutter silently in the chill wind.  The sound of sluggishly-flowing
water can be heard to the east, an almost mournful chorus.  Glimpses of
several structures can be seen through the trees in every direction, but
not so close that they disturb the courtyard.  A sturdy, wood-framed
building rises immediately to the north.

The Guildhall~
Greasy, black stains creep out into the center of the room, as if someone
had thoughtlessly scattered the coals of the fire onto the wood of the
floor.  The stone hearth dominates the western wall of the room,
soot-stained but still intact.  An empty iron cookpot hangs from a hook
above the cold hearth, and several of the trestle tables have been
chopped into firewood-sized pieces, some stuffed into the hearth, some
scattered along the eastern side of the room.  Shattered glass litters
the bar, which is almost untouched except for several deep scratches. 
There is no evidence of the stools which must have stood before the bar,
but several of the benches have been thrown behind it.

Before a Quartz Gate~
You stand just inside of the large gates leading from the Ebon Citidel.
The sheer size of the southern entrance is astounding, drawing into
question how the arch and its closure were created.  A pair of
crystalline doors, a milky quartz in color, bar passage through the
archway.  No hinges can be seen in the quartz doors, though there are
dark, nearly black smudges, on the outside surface.  In the distance,
less than a score of buildings rise up from the level landscape.  Of
differing designs, the structures all seem to be of the same skillful
craftsmanship.

Courtyard - Near a Temple~
An imposing structure of obsidian marble soars upward into the empty
eastern sky.  Thinly veined with silver, the stone seems pulled from the
night sky itself.  Once-elegant arches, pillars, and flying buttresses
lie broken and shattered on the ground.  Remnants of a circular,
stained-glass window still gleam with dark, jewel tones from the center
of the facade, gaping holes diminishing its beauty.  Wickedly-grinning
gargoyles, carved from the same night-colored stone of the walls,
surround the gaping hole filled with jagged pieces of ruined glass.  An
elaborate archway carved out of a single slab of the black marble allows
entrance into the partially destroyed building.

Shattered pieces of ebon marble lie strewn upon the ground at the base of
the temple.  Embedded in several season's growth of weeds and grass,

have fit the gaping wounds of broken stone high up on the front wall of
the building.

Light reflects oddly off of the slivers of stained glass still clinging

Shining black marble pulls away from gleaming silver teeth, cunningly

Inside the Temple~
Once the source of illumination for the temple's interior, tarnished
silver braziers lie toppled along the aisle, the sole upright one
attempting to light the room alone.  Dark pillars, once brilliant columns
whose silver veining reflected the flickering, brazier light, have fallen
into a sad state of neglect.  Cuts and chips mar the black marble
pillars, diminishing their value but not the memory of their beauty. 
Pews lie broken and shattered upon the floor, no longer facing the altar
at the front of the room.  In a feeble attempt to flow along the center
aisle, the tattered remnants of a dingy, white carpet converge with the
bare threads of a runner covering the raised dais in the center of the
temple.  The burnt and broken stubs of alabaster candles fill tarnished
candelabras along the outer walls of the temple.  An elaborate staircase
spirals down into darkness.

The four pillars supporting the second story of the temple are in a sad

The pews the once formed two rows of seating have all been shattered and

Flowing down the center aisle of the grand temple is the remnant of a

The Altar to the Gods~
Cast shadows alternate with pools of azure radiance given off by the
blue-flamed ivory candles placed reverently up the altar.  Bent
candelabras gleam dully metallic at the edges of the room, small, grey
pools of wax filling their bowls.  The blue light reflects oddly off the
silver-inlaid runes carved into the great stone that is the altar.  Each
of the sigils, flawlessly formed of pure silver, symbolizes a god or
goddess, none taking precedence over another, or varying in anything
other than shape.  Strangely enough, the altar chamber appears
undisturbed by the destruction visited upon the remainder of the temple.

Dark runes, dimly pulsing with an unworldly power, are carved into dark,
obsidian walls.  Cracks and the stains of dried blood now mar the
once-perfect complexion of these glistening walls.  The burned out
remains of a single torch, held in a tarnished and worthless mithril
sconce, lends proof that this room was inhabited in the not so distant
past.  A stand, fashioned into the shape of a dragon's claw, lies tipped
on its side in the center of the room, and shattered on the floor are the

Along the Wall~
The outer wall of the compound shows a great amount of damage, as does
the actual ground underfoot.  The battlements to the east still reach
their original, towering heights, although great chunks of rock have been
torn from them.  A semi-circle of earth, completely devoid of vegetation,
radiates outward from the crumbling wall.  Small fragments of black metal
dot the barren landscape in odd clusters, ending at a point where traces
of dead grass still remain on the rim of the circle.

outer wall damage battlements east rock shattered~
Great damage has been visited on the outer wall of the compound, chunks
of the rock having been blasted away.  Looking more closely at the
damage, it could be concluded that the force of the blows came from the
outside and the stone was blasted inward.  The wall still stands, but
sections of the rock are completely gone, although not so much that the
area is indefensible.

earth black metal fragments landscape odd clusters~
This circle of black metal appears to be some sort of airborne delivered
shrapnel.  The vast majority of the fragments are buried, with only small
portions of the metal poking up through the earth.  Apparently lit on
fire before being catapulted, the pieces are scorched and covered in a
fine black dust.  The effect of such a barrage was devastating, as
evidenced by the lack of vegetation surviving in the area.

Before a Ruined Gate~
A slender sapling has pushed through the bed of fine gravel that forms
the path, leading away from the ruined gate to the east.  Crafted of
milky quartz, the gate itself, still mostly intact, has been heavily
damaged beyond repair.  The earthen-colored wall has collapsed in upon
itself here slightly, a definitive dip appearing in the height of the
wall above the quartz portal.  The gravel pathway leads westward toward
the center of the compound, bordered here by fields that stretch both to
the north and south.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
Crushed gravel creates an easily walked road underfoot.  Slicing through
the natural landscape, this finely-broken rock looks as if it were meant
to be here, rather than added by mortal hands.  Remnants of a short hedge
run beside the path on the north, standing between it and a long line of
barren-limbed trees.  The walkway continues to the east toward a pair of
quartz gates, and westward deeper into the compound.

The dirt path narrows as it proceeds to the north, becoming somewhat
cleaner as if there were more traffic in this part of the compound. 
Footprints embedded into the soft ground along the pathway indicate a
variety of small animals frequent this location, perhaps in search of
food.  Southward, a solid-looking structure intrudes upon the landscape,
the wood of its crafting dark and apparently well-maintained.  A chill
breeze carries wistfully into the ragged-looking trees off to the west,
blowing their heavy branches roughly against the sky.  The dense hedgerow
to the east continues onward, blocking sight and progress in that
direction.

This path is layered with dark grey dirt, loosely-packed as if it had not
been often traveled upon.  The compound's large stone wall runs parallel
on the west-hand side of the path, towering twenty feet or so above the
ground.  A thick row of leafy green hedges obscure any view or travel to
the east, and are planted not far from the wall, causing this path to be
very narrow.  To the south, the path narrows even further as it leads up
to the wall of a large, wooden building.  The path opens up a bit towards
the north, where an angle in the protective wall causes it to veer off to
the east.

often.  The compound's northern wall is visible a short distance away.  A
small dirt trail leads off to the west, then turns to the south to follow

The gravel pathway forms a four way intersection.  On one front, three
statues unleash a wall of almost palpable evil, while on the opposite
side, the west and north walls creep closer, eventually blocking vision
and passage in both directions.  The two statues lying to the southeast
are black and menacing.  The other, to the east of the pair, is stranger
still with its gem-like, translucency and its flat-seeming,
two-dimensional shape.  The north gate of glistening quartz lies a few
yards to the north, inserted into the long and intruiging northern
compound wall.  The path flows east and west along the wall, taking a
southward turn where it continues westward.

South of the Crystalline Gates~
You stand just inside of the large northern gate leading to the outside
of The Ebon Citidel complex.  The gate is not immense by any
standards, but instead is extremly wide, allowing for the passage of
large wagons.  A pair of crystalline doors, a milky quartz in color bars
passage through the gate.  The gates hang as if by magic, suspended as
they are within the hollowed out section of the wall.  Dark smudges
appear to cover the outside of the quartz doors, as evidenced by the
complete lack of light penetrating this partially transparent stone.

Crushed Gravel Pathway -- Near a Pair of Towering Statues~
The paths from the south and west open up into a mid-sized patch of fine
gravel.  The gravel underfoot is a mix of light gray stones, crushed by
much use, along with dry dirt of a slightly darker hue.  Small clumps of
grasses poke up from the arid ground, their blades withered and pale.  A
large structure of dark, weathered wood stands off to the southwest, and
a brightly-colored golden building shines in the distance to the
southeast.  The wider patch of gravel runs to the north and east,
surrounding two jet black statues that lay to the northeast a few feet.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
The path opens up into a broad junction, leading off in all directions
from here.  Two tall black statues stand motionless in an open area to
the north, and the northern gates of the compound are visible in the
distance.  A gravel path leads off to the south and west, curving around
a two-story structure made of fine, dark wood.  To the east, the path
leads towards a shiny golden building that seems out of place in this
compound filled with death and destruction.

A Tiny Square Chamber~
The dark grey walls of this room form a perfect rectangular prism.  This
space before the library's floor is not large, no more than a single
human could squeeze between the four walls at any given time.  This
appears to be a storage space for valuables, as it is very small and
secretive feeling.  The walls are smooth and cold, the combination of
tight spacing and chilling temperatures emanating a claustrophobic affect.

Along the Ramparts~
Here in the southeastern corner of the ramparts, a guard would be able to
watch two directions at once for approaching enemies.  Though distand,
the eastern and southern roads are visible from here.  Chiseled into the
inner section of the wall, a narrow stairway leads directly down into the
courtyard beside a dark marble building.  A few creeping vines are
evident, cresting the top of the staircase as they attempt to cover the
walls in its entirety.  The vines are yet another reminder that little
care has been taken to prevent the degradation of this once majestic
compound.

The narrow stairway descends sharply into the courtyard below.  The

From this distance it his hard to see much detail of the winding mountain

Clouds fill the sky overhead, adding to the sheer chill of the climate
here atop the plateau.  Over the ramparts, the rocky sides of the plateau
slope down sharply in swirled hues of grey rocks and dirt.  The stone
ramparts extend high enough so that an archer would have a good sight on
any travellers within range of his bow, making the surrounding areas
dangerous.  Inside the compound, a large, black marble temple temple
comes into view, a magnificient spectacle taking up a considerate portion
of this corner of the complex.

Silently flying over the walls of the compound, the flag of the cult of
Xharax acts as an eerie reminder that darkness has enshrouded this
compound.  The flaming eyes of the skull on the flag stare out over the
compound proper, seemingly coming to rest upon the black marble temple
that lies directly to the north within the stronghold.  Glancing out over
the walls of the compound, a sheer dropoff is evident just a short
distance off of the road.  Leading up to the gates, the mountaintop
curves towards the outer wall, acting as a defense for the whole
structure.  Evidently the stronghold was built in such a manner as to
provide as little ground outside the walls as possible, no doubt in an
effort to thwart any attacks from normal means.

Just beyond the embrace of the wall to the north lies an exquisite temple

Hidden from view from the grounds outside the main compound walls, a
medium-sized guard tower offers some small respite from the weather for a
weary guard.  Open on both the east and west, the tower's sole purpose
appears to be warmth and shelter for anyone on guard duty on rainy or
cold nights.  A small fire pit is set into the southern section of the
wall, crafted in such as way to allow for a flame to burn to provide
warmth yet to completely hide any light from a person standing on the
ground below.  The courtyard below and to the north is visible allowing
one to see anybody entering or leaving any one of the compounds buildings. 
o the south is the small road that leads up to the compound gates.

A semi-circle of the same earthen-colored rock as the entirety of the
walls is visible to the south.  The half circle is the top portion of the
crest of the Ebon Citidel that overlooks both the southern gate and
the road leaing up to the mountain plateau.  This would be one of the
main points of defense of the stronghold should it come under attack,
being as it is just above the southern road.  If the compound were under
attack the crest would actually become a defensive measure, as it would
be the perfect height for an archer to stand behind and still be able to
fire off his arrows.

errantly-shot arrows protrude from the walls of the tower near its peak. 
Looking out over the walls, it almost appears as if there is no ground

Top of the Stairs -- Along the Ramparts~
Chiseled directly into the wall is a narrow stairway, leading downward to
the bottom of the southwestern corner of the compound.  Moss covers most
of the staircase in dull green patches unbroken by any footprints. 
Normally a very strategic point in large area defense, this corner would
actually be little used in the event of combat.  The area directly below
to both the south and west drops off to deadly heights and would be
unusable by anyone attacking via normal means.  A slight distance to the
northeast, the top of an ivory tower is visible, while the path along the
top of the wall continues to both the north and east.

Small fissures and cracks cover the stone wall.  At first glance they

Along the Ramparts~
Any guard stuck on duty in this section of the compound would find
himself hardpressed to not find the view astounding.  Staring out over
the eastern wall, the complete lack of visible ground lends a serene
quality to the otherwise dismal scenes in this degraded stronghold.  The
ground is barely visible at all, so close is it to the outer wall itself
though it widens out a great deal toward the north and the eastern road. 
Staring back into the compound, the black marble, silver-veined temple
stands in silent memory of its once grandiose state.  Even damaged as it
is, the temple still remains a wonder to gaze upon.

icy tops.  Deep vales and high peaks spread out before you in a vast
panorama of stone and ice.
~
E
ground~
Of what you can make of the ground below it seems to be a mixture of
tussock, stone and fallen masonry.  As the plateau widens towards the
north, more of the ground becomes visible.  Judging by the type of
plants, life on the plateau is harsh as the thriving plants all tend to
be small and hiding in whatever sheltered spot they can find.
~
E
temple~
Even from here it is clear that the dark marble building would have been
an impressive structure in its heyday.  Once tall, majestic arches and
high buttresses would have stretch toward the heavens.  However it
appears that war and years of neglect have combined with the harsh
elements, cracking and breaking many of its dark stones.
~
E
road~
The dusty, narrow road can be seen winding its way across tthe windswept
plateau.  It ducks and dives into vales and over hillocks in its journey
through the high mountains.  At several places it disappears from view,
before cresting a rise to become visible again.
~
E
wall~
The earthen-colored stone of the walls shows small slight damage, small
chunks of rock lie at the base of the wall.  At the top of the wall a few
fissures creep downwards, their tendrils spreading out, eroding the
structural integrity of small sections of the ramparts.  In the wose
parts, thick gray mortar has been applied to stop further spread of the
already significant damage.

Along the Ramparts~
A makeshift flagpole has recently been erected at this section of the
wall, appearing to be the shafts of two polearms tied together with old,
fraying rope.  The flag of the cult of Xharax flies high enough that any
person approaching on the small road to the northeast would have no
doubts as to the compound's occupants.  The ground directly to the east
of the compound is nearly non-existent, the mountaintop plateau nearly a
shear drop from the base of the outer wall.  This creates a bottleneck
along the narrow approach to the gates, making the complex more easily
defended, but making any fall from the walls almost certain death.

The dirt road weaves through the high mountain plateau, taking travelers

Ruined Guard Tower~
Still appearing to be structurally sound, the outer wall here has
obviously taken quite a beating from some sort of deadly war machine. 
Great chunks of rock has literally been shattered out of the wall, making
the once pristine symmetric wall look lopsided.  The remains of a small
guard tower appear evident, the small roof that must have once stood
above has been comletely destroyed and now lies in rubble in the
courtyard below.  The rooftop road continues to the north admist even
more destruction or back to south, the wall there appearing to be as new
as the day it was created.

E
wall~
Shattered in many places, it is a wonder the wall still stands.  The
skilled masons that built the compound certainly built it to last. 
Although war machines have torn great chunks of stone from the wall, it
still offers good defense to any huddled defenders, allowing them to hold
the wall against wave after wave of assaulting troops.
~
E
tower~
It seems that the tower was the target of some mighty war machines.  Most
of it is now a shattered ruin.  The tower would have offered a much
better view of any approaching army than available from the wall, making
it an obvious target in any attack.  The base of the tower still stands,
as does part of its south section, although the remainder of the tower
has been blasted into shattered ruins that have fallen into the compound
below.

Above the Ruined Gate~
Small chunks of rock litter the uneven and damaged path along the
ramparts.  Obviously a large battle occured here, as the wall itself
shows great damage.  Large cracks and fissures mar the once smooth,
seamless walls.  The wall is actually slightly lower here than to the
south, but appears to be in better condition then the rest of the outer
wall to the north.  Barely defensibly sound, this section of the wall is
in need of a major overhaul.  The only good thing is that the wall never
fell, thus it still provides some advantage over anyone approaching on
the small road to the east.

Large chunks of stone have been smashed out of the stout wall, the

defenders.  Cracks and fissures dance across most of the wall's surface,  it
is doubtful that without repair the wall could stand against a renewed

Ruined Guard Tower~
Total decimation is evident on this tortured section of the outer wall. 
The wall itself had actually been partially breached, but as more damage
was reaped upon it the rubble seems to have filled the gap partially. 
Fissures, cracks and rubble not only litter the area, but is the norm
rather than the exception here.  A large gap is evident in the wall to
the north.  No repairs have been associated with this damage yet, leaving
the only way across the gap to be a death-defying leap.  More scenes of
destruction are evident to the south, while to the north the damage seems
to have been less common.

Blasted by the heavy hands of gigantic war machines, the stones of the
wall here have been shattered apart.  Great gouges out of the wall have
sent tons of rocks cascading downwards to the ground below.  Rents and
fissures cover the broken wall, their tenders spreading across most of
the surface.  As the icy wind howls from the mountains, it stirs dust and
stone flakes up.  Occasionally the clatter of falling rubble can be
heard, as the wall continues its slow descent into ruin.

Large clumps of lichen and mosses have taken hold in the large cracks and

The spiral stair continues toward the ceiling, stopping only at a narrow

The Arena of Champions~
A thick layer of fine sand covers the floor, colored a dark red in
several places.  Wooden racks line the walls, once filled with all manner
of weapons.  Carved into the southern wall, above an empty rack, is the
creed of The Ebon Citidel, 'Knowledge is Power'.  A quivering ball of
mage light, slowly losing its power, hangs just a few feet below the
ceiling, still bright enough to light the arena grounds.  The fine layer
of sand stretches out as far as the eye can see to both the west and
north, while a slightly rusty steel ladder leads upstairs.

What may have once been brilliant in its simplicity, now makes this room

A few jagged shards of dark, stained glass remain attached to the
wrought-iron framework of the circular window.  The remainder of the
window lies on the ground far below, just outside of the temple entrance. 
Fine silken cushions, now shredded and torn, rest on the floor amongst
the splinters of shattered, wooden pews.  A full-sized, wooden organ,
complete with mithril pipes, sits in an out-of-the-way corner of the
balcony.  Dark, sticky stains, reminiscent of spilled wine, cover the
organ, and its mithril pipes are tarnished and battered, in an attempt to
detach the pipes and carry them off.  In the ceiling above run some
poorly-disguised cracks, running straight and regular.

The Arena of Champions~
Having been ripped from the wall, a fully stocked weapons rack now covers
a portion of the sandy floor.  The weapons beneath it appear to have been
broken and bent under the weight of the massive wood rack.  The steel
clamps that held the rack in place are still buried deep within the cold,
stone walls.  An ephemeral ball of mage light hovers in the air just a
few feet below the ceiling, the remnants of the powerful spells once cast
upon the arena grounds.  A trail of blood-stained sand leads farther into
the arena to the north, evidence of a tragic fight that took place in the

The Arena of Champions~
A flickering ball of mage light, hovering a few feet below the ceiling,
causes shadows to dance around in this corner of the arena.  Wooden
training dummies, now broken, lend their forms to the dancing shadows,
making it difficult to focus on any one shape.  A large section of the
stone floor in the center of the room has been cleared of its fine layer
of sand.  Light can be seen at a short distance to both the south and the
west, perhaps emanating from more of the powerful magics worked here in
the past

The Arena of Champions~
The uppermost layers of the fine sand have been turned into a hard,
coagulated crimson mass.  Apparently a horrifying battle occurred here,
considering the amount of blood necessary to turn this amount of sand
into this hardened substance.  Buried into the northern wall are the
shattered remains of an axe head, its shaft no longer attached to the
jagged metal embedded into the rock.  Splintered into a millon pieces,
the remains of a weapons rack lie mixed in with the sand layered upon the
ground.

Storage Room~
The shattered remains of the storage room door lie amongst the empty,
overturned crates that litter the room.  The crates once held exotic
foods from across the lands, many bearing markings from far-away cities,
although the contents are long since gone.  Deep gouges have been hacked
into the dark, wooden walls, in an apparent attempt to find hidden
passages.  A rusty, steel ring, wet with condensation, is the only
noticeable blemish in the northern section of the floor, betraying the
existence of a finely-crafted trapdoor.

Ebon Citidel's Kitchen~
A vast fireplace dominates the eastern wall of the room, an oft used spit
poised above it.  The smell of decay permeates the air, caused by the
rotting carcass of a rabbit, floating in the shallow basin used as a sink. 
A long preparation table spans the length of the kitchen, heavily scarred
by the sharp knives used by the cooking staff.  A trapdoor is set into
the southern section of the floor, just below an open window that offers
a scenic view of the grounds.

An imposing structure of obsidian marble soars up into the empty eastern

broken and crumpled on the ground.  Remnants of a circular stained glass
window still gleam in dark jewel tones from the center of the facade, now
gaping holes diminishing its beauty.  Wickedly grinning gargoyles carved
from the same night-colored stone of the walls surround the gaping hole
filled with jagged pieces of stained glass.

Cold water sluggishly rolls down the southern wall of this storage room,
funneled across the room in a wooden trough.  Dimly pulsing orbs of white
light hang at equal intervals above the trough.  The water appears to be
magically moved across the room, through the trough, towards the northern
wall.  Large steel hooks, covered with coagulated blood hang from the
ceiling overtop of now rotted and broken tables.  Wooden shelves lining
every square inch of wallspace are now totally bare save cobwebs and moss. 
A carved wooden ladder, slimy with mold and mildew, leads up to a large

Every table in the room has been destroyed, glancing around you can see
evidence of both natural damage and the damage of weapons.  Some of the

Damp Wine Cellar~
Water cascades down the southern wall, forming a shallow pool in the
center of the slightly-sloping floor of the room, that empties into an
underground stream.  Row upon row of wine racks lining the walls, once
housed some of the finest wines of the world, now sit empty.  A few
barrels hide in a darkened corner of the room, their wooden staves still
perfectly water proof.  A steep, spiraling staircase ascends to a
mahogany trapdoor in the ceiling, its wood untouched by the passage of
time.

Food Smoking House~
A vast fireplace dominates the westward-lying wall, and when taken into
account, along with a smaller firepit centered in the floor, strongly
suggests this room was used for smoking and preserving meat.  Everything
in the room is stone-crafted, from wall to ceiling to the tables the meat
is supposed to rest on.  Large iron hooks, from which the various sides
of meat were hung during the curing process, are suspended from the
ceiling, some with traces of dried blood and remnants of dead flesh still
attached to them.  The stone tables that ring the chamber bear deep
gouges, ruining their value but not their practical use.  A thick, stone
door designed to retain all possible heat within, blocks passage to the
west.

The forces of entropy seem to have had a hand in creating utter chaos in
what was once a mage's workroom.  Books, scrolls, broken glass, and other

large, stone table centered in the room.  The western wall is covered
with soot, having reached out from the fireplace in some sort of an

it seems likely that someone was possessed of the bad idea to throw a
spellbook into the fire.  A brilliant, green rune glows upon the smooth

Destroyed Bedchamber~
Once a comfortable sleeping area, this small chamber has been reduced to
shambles.  Ruined books spill out of a set of wooden shelves, its plinths
apparently broken by some sharp, hacking weapon.  Fragments of tinder
litter the gaping wounds of what was once a solid, oaken bed, one of its
hacked off posts tossed across the room.  A miniature painting once hung
above the ivory fireplace, its delicate wooden frame still residing there. 
The canvas that once filled the frame lies in disorderly array atop the
mantle, shredded and rotting.  A malignent, blue rune hovers above a
narrow, ivory door at chest height, somehow coiling in upon itself even

Ivory Spiral Stair~
The ivory stair disappears downward toward the base of the tower, curving
inward upon itself with no support pillar evident.  More than just
chiseled pieces of cold, carved stone, the railings seem like serpents
coiling through the air alongside the stairway.  An intricate rune carved
directly into the ivory door to the west, pulses a bright, majestic
magenta, its light so bright it blurs the eyes.  Set into the ivory wall
to the north is a flat panel of smooth platinum, roughly door shaped.

This panel of platinum does not appear to be transfixed to the wall but

Decimated Laboratory~
Destruction and mayhem have run rampant in what looks to be the wreckage
of an old laboratory.  Vast sections of the room are buried beneath solid
sheets of glass, the affects of a raging fire upon the uncounted vials,
beakers and jars once housed in the ruined room.  Glass wasn't the only
fatality of the heat, the walls themselves ran molten, destroying
intricate webs of runes that covered their once-glossy surfaces. 
Sporadic, pale pulses of light still emanate from some of the runes,
hinting that a portion of the great magicks cast here are still intact. 
A single sigil stands out, throbbing crimson upon the eastward door.

Once covered from ceiling to floor in a webwork of arcane symbols, an act

High Mage's Room~
The entire room seems to have every item exactly in its place.  No
battles appear to have been fought here, unlike the rest of the compound. 
A few scorch marks do mar the surface of the ivory floor, just in front
of the small fireplace midway in the northern wall.  Bookshelves abound,
covering nearly every available inch of wall space, while a desk of black
marble dominates the center of the chamber.  A glowing mage globe casts a
soft crimson light, causing the ivory surfaces to glow an evil red.  A
small archway leads out to a balcony to the west, freeing a cold breeze
to flow continually through the chamber.  An intricate rune carved
directly into the ivory door to the east, pulses a bright, majestic
magenta.

extravagance in their own way.  Each of the shelves holds a small fortune
in books, some of them no doubt actual spell books from past mages who
resided here.

E
glowing mage globe~
Hovering just beneath the ceiling in the room's center, a diminutive,
fading globe of arcane origin shines just brightly enough to light the
room.  The soft crimson, glow from the small sphere reflects off the
ivory, turning the walls a sinister red, almost as if they were bleeding. 
Shadows dance about the room with each flicker of the waning globe.

As if the flames from a blazing fire had once leapt from the ivory
hearth, scorch marks stain the cream-colored floor in a uniform pattern,
spreading outward in a wide arc from the fireplace.

Cut into the western wall, an open archway offers access to a narrow
balcony.  The curve of the arch is smooth, its opening the height an
average-sized human could walk under without ducking.  Perpetually,
breezes blow through the arch to chill the room.

The ancient, leather-bound tome shows signs of decay as the march of time
slowly, but inevitably, destroys it.  The book's spine is cracked and
broken from rot, and the pages are crinkled and stained, making the

Solid black marble reflect the eerie glow of dark mage lights from its
smooth, flat surface.  Papers and scrolls lie scattered on it, and open

showing some sign of wear.

longer can mere mortals create such relics, the power torn away by the
very gods who gave it, each saving their power for the godly wars that
were fast brewing.  Thus I study these artifacts, in an effort to vault

with flaming hooves that could fly, and titans of unbelievable size that

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
A path of fine, powdery gravel, once cushioning the footfalls of the
Ebon Citidel's residents, meanders parallel to the guildhall walls. 
Sporadic trees, grown well into maturity, soar skyward, at one time
providing shade for those wandering here.  The trees' limbs, no longer
clothed in lush greenery, droop now, their barren branches depressed and
sickly.  The walkway continues northward, and southward the grounds
opening up before the site of an ivory tower.

Beside a Fountain~
The crushed, black rock has been laid in a circular path here, ringing
the exquisite fountain that stands within its perimeter.  The fountain
captures the visage of a forest unicorn in mid-rear, crafted in such a
way that it is eerily lifelike.  This narrow circular path and fountain
seem untouched by time, the statue still as perfect as the day it was
carved, the gravel still fresh and clean.  Faint gurgling noises emanate
from the fountain as if its magics still attempted to spout water into
the air only to shower down across the unicorn.

Dark, still, water draws the ambient light down into the seemingly
bottomless pool in the center of the room.  The ivory walls are shadowed,

Crushed Gravel Pathway -- Along the Western Wall~
A carefully sculpted turn in the pathway leads off to the north, halting
before a large wooden structure that blocks the way.  The track was once
edged by a fine hedge that now lays trampled and dying.  The curving
gravel trail leads both north and back toward the east, while westward a
a living wall of trees prevents travel in that direction.

sections have been trampled underfoot by someone or something, enough

Before a Wooden Barn~
The building standing to the north was constructed of a wide, dark lumber
of unknown variety.  Barely noticeable through the trees to the west is
the wall that surrounds the Ebon Citadel's compound.  A small hitching
post sits off to the east of the gravel path, once used for tethering
horses until a stableboy was able to tend to the beasts.  The crushed
gravel underfoot lends itself to an easy hike southward, while the barn
is accessible through the large, double doors, that are securely latched
by a thick, sturdy beam and a lock.

You stand at the front of a beautifully built, covered stable.  Small
sconces dot the free space on the walls next to the stable doors both to
the east and west.  Remnants of tallow candles rest in each of the

arrived at The Ebon Citadel.  A set of large, double doors bars

Small, aged sconces line the free space of the walls to the east and

The pair of doors to the south lies in the shadow of an overhead loft,
offering entrance and exit from the stable proper.  The wood of the
construction appears to be much like that of which the stable themselves
were built, but less weathered and more scarred by hooves and other marks. 
At the base of the right door of the pair, a strange set of claw marks
can be vaguely discerned in the low light.  The nature of these deep
grooves cannot be determined without much closer scrutiny.
~

Strange claw markings are found in a few places near the base of the
doors.  Upon further inspection, it is obvious, they aren't from a very
large creature -- this much can be ascertained by touch -- but little
else is obvious, such as the size or length of the claw, due to the
location and lack of light at the base of the door.

Small Stable Stall~
A discoloration appears in the southwestern corner of the wall of this
stall.  The stain was, perhaps, caused by an animal that was backed into
the corner and summarily slaughtered, as it appears to be thicker near
the center of the smear.  Only a few stray pieces of hay lie scattered
across the dark, wooden and it is obvious no animals have been kept here
in quite some time.  A gate, just wide enough for a full-sized war horse,
to walk through blocks your access to the east and the stables beyond.

Small peices of hay lay sparcely scattered about the stall floor.  Some

The sweet smell of burnt hay assaults the nose within the confines of the

charred, yet still standing, eastern wall.  A small, discolored rectangle
appears on the southern wall, the only remaining proof that a plaque once
adorned the wooden walls.  A small, empty feeding trough and a water pail
filled with fetid water are attached to the divider between this stall
and its northern neighbor.  The only available exit is through the wooden
gate to the west, although a small child might attempt exit through the
window to the south.

You stand at the back of the covered stables, a stall to both the east

wooden floor.  A hastily crafted lock has been set into the stall door to
the west, a sign written in shaky handwriting hangs crookedly above the
lock.  Attached to the northern wall are wooden pegs, typically used by
the stableboys to hang up their tools, hanging from one is the
decomposing skull of an aged dwar,f.

Small Stable Stall~
This stall appears to be kept in well maintained order.  Both the wooden
feeding trough and the water pail, set into the divider on the southern
wall, have been filled with fresh grain and water.  An ample supply of
fresh hay has been spread out on the ground, next to the bail from which
it originated.  A small picture-window has been set into the eastern wall
your way back to the main stall thoroughfare to the west.

Scattered about the floor is an abundance of fresh-smelling hay. 
Brilliant yellow, compared to the hay found throught the rest of this
place, it appears to have originated from a large bail sitting in the

hay pressed away.

the ground here.

Small Stable Stall~
This horse-sized stall has been untouched by the cruel test of time.  A
small pile of clean, yet slightly mildewed hay lies in a corner just
beneath a narrow, picturesque window in the western wall.  An empty,
rusty watering pail sits next to a feeding trough, both firmly attached
to the wooden wall.  The only out of place object in this quaint horse
stall is the skeleton of a goblin lying just a few feet from the
eastward-lying door.

skeleton goblin doorway 1 east~
Despite the apparent normality of the small stall, there is one jarring
element.  The corpse of a goblin, a stableboy indicated by his dress,
lies just a foot inside the entrance gate.  Obvious by the state of the
bones, his death was a vicious event, The skull is fractured and split in
three places.  None of the bones are in orderly fashion, instead they lie
in small pile where the goblin collapsed during his death throes.

Before the Gates~
Looming grimly over its surroundings, a massive stone archway soars
skyward.  Centered at the apex of the arch, a cracked and crumbling crest
perches just above a pair of crystalline doors crafted of milky quartz. 
Deep scratches and scorch marks mar the surface of the portals, where a
shattered fragment broken from one disfigures an octagonal hole set into
its translucent surface.  No hinges can be seen in the doors or seams and
footings in the earth-colored wall.  The whole of the construction gives
the impression of being torn from the ground by the forces of powerful
magics.

A small pool rests within a copse of stately oak trees, its surface
rippling slightly as if part of a stream rather than just stagnant water. 
Smooth, seamless walls rise to the south, forming the first layer of
defense for the compound.  The walls seem to be of the exact composition
as the surrounding earth, leaving the impression they were pulled
forcibly from the ground by a great expenditure of ancient magic.

Along the Wall~
A small hitching post huddles beneath the limbs of a spreading oak tree. 
If this tree were clothed in lush foliage, any animal tethered there
would rest comfortably in relative shade.  Unfortunately, few leaves
adorn the outstretched limbs of this old, wooden giant, nor do any appear
to have dropped recently from its branches.  A field of dried grass
continues on towards the west, approaching the corner of the compound's
walls while slightly to the southeast the front gates are visible.

Hay Loft~
A large, square glassless window takes up the entire northern wall of the
small hayloft.  A frayed rope, used to lift hay into the loft, hangs from
a wooden beam poised just above the window.  Sections of the wooden floor
have rotted away, leaving gaping holes where the sweet smelling, freshly
cut bales once were stored.  Old, mildewy straw litters the remaining
floor, its only effective use a home for a host of insects of the most
unpleasant varieties.  A rickety plank has been placed across the largest
gap leading to the southern section of the loft, while a wooden ladder
leads back down to the stable floor.

large square glass-less window rope frayed~
Taking up most of the northern wall is an immense, square-shaped cutout.

dangles loosely from a wide beam attached firmly to the stable wall,
centered above the window.

Scattered about the loft are gaping holes of considerable proportions. 
Hay bales were at one time stacked atop where the holes now lie, but many
of the boards of the floor have long since rotted away, making the area a
treacherous place to walk.
~
E
old mildewy straw~
Like most of the litter found throughout the loft, the bent and broken
pieces of old straw show signs of the mildew caused by being damp for
long stretches of time.  Clumped in piles between the holes in floor or
stacked into corners, most of the straw shows signs of gnawing.  A
variety of insects of the more unsavory sorts, crawl in and out of the
low straw clusters where they have made their home.

Marble Hallway~
Dank and dusty, the hallway has lost the natural beauty created by the
silver-laced, obsidian marble.  The vaulted ceiling, although festooned
with cobwebs, has survived the vandalism reaped upon the rest of the
marble.  Chipped and scratched, the once-elegant arches still stand a
quiet sentinel for the rooms to the north and south.  Rusting steel
sconces, set into the western wall, hold the remains of torches that
sputtered out long ago, yet another reminder of long-term neglect.  A
spiral stair leads back up to the alcove within the temple proper, while
the hallway continues to the east.

Chipped and scratched, the once-elegant arches stand as quiet sentinels

A heavily runed archway, set into northern wall, dominates this deadend
in the hallway.  Cobwebs and dust cover every square inch of the dark
marble, including the vaulted ceilings, save for the engraved archway
lying northward.  A nearly identical archway stands to the south,
although it is by far less intricately runed, and lacks the magical glow
of the arched portal lying northward.  A large crest can be seen through
the dust covering the dark marble on the eastern wall.  Although scarred
and vandalized, the Ebon Citidel crest can still be identified.  The
marble hallway leads off to the west, away from the engraved archway.

mystic circle of power.  At the center of the metallic canopy, there is a
small diamond shaped hole, no doubt it once held some sort of holy object
that was the focal point for some forgotten clerical ritual.  The
personalized sigil that once topped the archway to the south has been
completely obliterated, perhaps due to some superstitious reasoning of
the vandals that damaged the circle to begin with.

Large gashes have been slashed into the marble that forms the elegant

E
metal canopy diamond hole sigil~
A cluster of entwined sigils, crafted out of a blackened steel, merge
together to form one large, flowing rune.  Small rust spots dot the
delicately thin metal canopy, further adding to the frailness of the
steel.  At the exact center of the sigil a diamond shaped hole destroys
the symmetry of the sigil - obviously something was intended to rest
within.

Living Quarters~
As if a huge explosion had ripped through here sometime in the distant
past, little remains of the room.  The once majestic dark, marble walls
have been crushed and collapsed in upon themselves, making the chamber
little bigger than a closet.  An ornate, golden shrine can still be seen
through a small crevice in the tons of rock that have fallen upon it. 
Whichever god this shrine is dedicated to is unclear, but it is obvious
that in material value it is worth a small fortune.  The only way out of
the rubble-strewn room is through the archway to the north.

The small golden shrine rests within a crevice formed during the cave-in

before an altar to one of the gods.  From this distance it is impossible

The elegant archway to the north was undamaged by the the explosion that

Shadows dance about the room, cast by a small tallow candle set in a
steel sconce attached to the wall.  Just below the sconce in the northern
corner of the room, resides a small shrine, covered with paintings of a
beautiful woman, and partially covered with a strange black goo.  On the
western wall, a faded tapestry hangs by mere threads, while on the
eastern wall a painting depicts a small family.  Upon the back wall
stands a mysterious rack, covered in ebony, ivory and sapphire, most of
this showing some slight damage.  A narrow bed lies under the rack,
covered in the tattered remains of a once-elegant blanket.

This looks very much like a large, weapons rack, and judging by its

The faded, tattered blanket, stitched with a picture of a great tiger
caught in mid-leap, mouth agape in a viscious snarl, lies smoothly across
the narrow bed.  Behind the cat, a waterfall tumbles into a silver ribbon
of river, winding through a small copse of trees.  Barely visible within
the shadows of the trees, more than a handful of men armed with bows gaze
outwardly...whether at the great cat or something else is hard to tell.

An ornate tapestry of a rampant black unicorn wreathed in black roses
dominates the room, hung in the center of the southern wall.  The
masterwork of a skilled craftsman, the threads gleam in the reflected
light of several braziers, lit with flickering mage globes.  A second
tapestry, this one depicting a map of the known realm, hangs on the
eastern wall.  A simple mahogany bed, showing the same craftsmanship as
the desk, rests in the western corner.  Strangely untouched by the
wreckage of the temple above, this room seems unusually shadowed for the

Entrance to Clerical Ebon Citidel~
Standing as mute and blind sentinels, two towering statues flank the
human-sized, mithril door perched between them.  Despite their
lifelessness, the pair of contructs gives the strong impression of being
ever-vigilant, ever-appraising of any given situation.  No footprints are
evident in the thin layer of dust on the floor, and the chamber looks as
new as the day it was first created.  A heavily engraved archway leads
off to the south, the only accessible egress from the room.  A single
sputtering torch illuminates the room with its soft blue glow, the sconce
it rests in as shiny as the day it was created.

Living Quarters~
A faintly glowing mage globe hovers near the central point of the vaulted
ceiling, illuminating a stunning depiction of a forest unicorn.  This
room has survived most of the vandalism that ran rampant throughout the
compound.  The marble walls are still smooth to the touch, except for a
heavily engraved section of the southern wall.  Obviously the original
inhabitant of this chamber greatly enjoyed mahogany, as both the desk and
the large bed were carved from solid pieces of this expensive wood. 
Gauging the size of the two pieces of furniture, neither seems small
enough to have fit through the northward-lying archway.  How they arrived
here is anyone's guess.

Between a Tower and the Wall~
A dry and beaten bed of brown grass, long dead, recedes from growing
patches of desolate dirt.  Rising prominently from the lifeless field, a
seamless ivory tower lies northward, black scorch marks covering its
polished surface to a level of twenty feet.  To the south, the arid plot
ends abruptly at the base of the earthen-hued stone of the walls.  The
field of dead and drying vegetation continues on toward the east and west.

From the middle of this vast field of dried grass, only the outer walls
of the compound break the monotony of the flatness.  Two ancient bales of
hay have tumbled to the ground here, remnants of colorful paints
emblazoned on the outside of the bundles.  Half buried in a splotch of

Mass Grave Site~
Underfoot the loose-packed earth has been turned, the site of a
hurriedly-dug, shallow mass grave.  The ground is uneven, the mounds of
dirt heaped in roughly humanoid shapes.  A few random bones can be seen
sticking out of the ground at odd angles, exposed to view by the passage
of time and weather.  Ironically there is no evidence of a fight having
occured on this spot, which is perhaps the reason the dead were buried
here.  The gravel pathway to the north may also have been a deciding
factor in the location of the burial ground.

South of an Ancient Tree~
Chunks of rock and fine gravel intermingle with shattered bones amongst
the trampled, dead grass underfoot.  A venerable, towering oak, its trunk
so wide ten people encircling its vast girth would be unable to touch
each other's hands, blocks further progress to the north.  Bound to the
trunk of the tree is a human skeleton, rusting iron spikes evident in
this tortured body, still skewer its wrists in place.  A short distance
to the east lies a gravel walkway, allowing easier progress than this

Beside the Ivory Tower~
Small chunks of rock and fine gravel make up the remnants of an overgrown
gravel pathway.  Nature overtook the walkway long since, a tale told by
dead weeds and grass violating its surface.  The field is by no means
flat and level like its surroundings, although no evidence remains to
indicate what might have altered the landscape in such a small, localized
area.  A large tower of pearlescent ivory, heavily scratched and gouged,
rises forth from the ground to the south.

Sorely damaged by axe blade and sword, great gashes have been hacked into

Behind the Barn~
A narrow dirt path dead-ends at the wall of a substantial wooden barn. 
The barn is made out of a very dark, strange-looking wood.  Glancing up,
a large, paneless window set into the side of the upper level of the barn
becomes noticeable.  Hanging from a pulley attached to the roof, a rope
dangles in front of the window, probably the way occupants would haul hay
to the upper level for storage.  The path leads off to the north, running
between the large stone wall protecting the compound on the west and a
thick hedgerow to the east.

In the upper part of this building, approximately twenty feet overhead, a

A simple pulley is attached in the roof here, swaying softly in the gentle

Hay Loft~
A major portion of the floor in this section of the loft has rotted away,
creating large gaping wounds.  Scatterings of straw litter the remaining
boards, excluding a cleared out area in one corner, resembling a hastily
constructed living space.  A bedroll of worn, tattered blankets lies next
to a rusting bucket, and a relatively fresh pile of straw forms a pillow
at the top of the bedroll.  The only apparent exit is a solid-looking
plank that stretches across the largest hole, giving access to the
northern section of the loft.

Bell Tower~
The small tower lies at the absolute peak of the marble temple.  A golden
bell of vast girth hangs from a thick chain, nearly a handspan in
diameter, secured to one of the oaken beams that supports the domed roof. 
Set into the western wall, a lone window offers a spectacular view of the
compound's front yard.  Opposite the obsidian temple, across the
courtyard to the west and beyond a wooden building, lies the ivory tower,
quite small from here at the edge of vision.  A few cracks are set into
the marble floor, blending in nearly perfectly.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
As the path proceeds beyond the overlapping shadows thrown by the two
buildings, more detail of the ground and the structures is available to
the eye.  A golden building off to the east is accentuated by two large
windows, and has intricately etched writing of some sort covering the
entire side.  A wooden structure to the west is crafted of a strange,
dark wood that seems to sparkle a purplish color in the available light. 
The main path here runs north and south next to the wooden building, with
a little bit of open space available to the east before it ends at the
golden wall.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
The path here is an alley of sorts, narrowing as it cuts between the
golden structure to the east, and the wooden one to the west.  The
building to the west is built entirely of dark wood, and appears to be
quite sturdy and strong, although small signs of weathering are apparent. 
Green grasses grow at the base, and even some flowers are noticeable, a
wide contrast to the usual death and decay ever present elsewhere in the
compound.  The building of gold to the east looks quite spectacular, a
solid side of pure gold, set with two grand windows.  The path continues
north around to the other sides of the two buildings, possibly to
entrances.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
Coming to a break in the path, the main gravel road has an intersecting
branch to the east, that leads all the way alongside a golden building to
the far compound wall.  An ancient tree of gargantuan proportions blocks
any movement west, its long winding branches twisted into the sky and
playing in the clouds.  The tree appears to be very lifeless and dead,
lacking any signs of greenery.  North, past the tree, the gravel walkway
moves alongside a wooden building, not appearing to have any special
markings or structures on the outside, but looking quite simple.

Backyard~
As travel progresses about this place, more and more scenes lacking in
life are noticed, and the sense of coldness and dread becomes more
overwhelming.  Running horizontally south of here a once lush row of
hedges about the size of a dwarf has long since lost most of its green
foliage, looking no more than a tangle of twigs and branches, with the
occasional leaf.  A giant bird nest rests inside one of the openings, but
no signs of a mother or babies can be seen or heard, leading to the belief
that the nest is probably abandoned.  Southwest of here a fountain comes
into view as the path wraps around it in a circle.  Northeast is a nice
change of scenery; a building crafted of pure gold it seems, providing a
bit of warmth to handle the cold feelings emitted from the lack of life
here.

A long row of short hedges runs on the south side of the area, heading

non-herbaceous stems zig-zagging around and about each other, making

bird nest, probably that of a crow.  No babies or mother can be seen or

Behind a Golden Building~
Gold sheathing cover most of the stone building to the north, making it
appear to be crafted out of solid gold.  Small sections of the wall have
been almost obliterated in the attempt to remove the precious metal. 
Intricate carvings of what appears to be a flowing script still cover the
remaining sheets of gold, though segments of whatever story they told are
now missing.  Towering high above to the south are ancient oak trees,
guarding the backside of the once-gleaming building in mute attendance. 
Barely capable of being considered a path, lightly trampled grass runs
along the back of the building to the east.

Along the Wall~
Scorched stone, grim gray ashes and pieces of broken, burnt wood lie is
scattered disarray here.  Brushes of gray, black, and deep red paint a
scene of destruction on the surreal canvas of ground and remaining wall. 
A large, elliptical-shaped section of the wall is gone, the stone around
it shattered and charred.  Like a leopard skin, ebon spots coat the
massive, defensive structure that cowers on the ground now in pitiful
heaps.  The scene of destruction is so real, the faint scents of burning
grasses and wood smoke still linger in the air, as if it occurred only
yesterday.  Amidst the rampart's ruins, wedged between some fallen
stones, a score of pikes stand upright, their pointed barbs sharp and
still intact.  The path forms a three-way junction here, the bisected
line running north and south along the wall, the intersecting path
running west along the backside of the golden-sided building.

A few pikes, approximately eight feet in length, are wedged nicely

at random angles, and look quite sharp despite the damage done to most
everything here.  The fact they all point up, are wedged, and sharp, just
seems a bit coincidental though, but the stones holding them are huge, so
it is likely they were not set that way on purpose.

Along the Wall~
The golden building to the west is a marvel to behold.  The shiny surface
brightly reflects any light directed towards it, even the dimmest of
moonlight.  Intricate patterns are etched into the entire surface of the
gold, apparently by some sort of fine acid and drawing materials.  The
meaning of the etchings is unkown, though some sort of scripting pattern
is present.  The compound wall to the east is in relatively good shape,
with only minimal battle scarring on its surface.  The path that runs
north and south between the building and the wall is heavily rutted,
evidence of heavy traffic in the past.

This section of the path lies midway along the side of the wonderous,
golden building.  The entire expanse of the wall here is covered with
inscriptions of fine detail.  Upon closer observation the markings appear
to have a certain order and pattern to them.  Visible above the rune-like
script, an irregular circle of glowing green blemishes the construction's
golden perfection.  Opposite the gilt structure the ramparts have been
repaired.  been damaged, but is undergoing repairs, as freshly spread
mortar is seen in places.  Against the base of the wall is an upright
wheelbarrow, very large and full of what looks like some stones and maybe
a tool or two.

Along the Wall~
A monstrous golden building, at least twenty feet high, dominates the
view to the west.  Refractions of light become almost blinding off of its
shiny surface.  Tall grasses about a foot tall grow up between the path
and the side of the golden building.  About five feet from the ground, a
ruby-red rectangle is fitted into the side of the golden wall.  Within
the bounds of the rectangle are intricate carvings of old runes, their
meaning unintelligible.  The remainder of the wall is covered in the same
punctilious enscribings as the rest of the building.  The slate-colored
wall to the east is in need of moderate repair, its stones heavily
cracked and broken from previous battles.  The path here runs to the
north and south between the building and the compound wall.

sits squarely in the middle of the structure's wall.  Everywhere around

Along the Wall~
A slate-colored wall of stones to the east helps protect the compound
from invaders and the elements.  Unlike most of the other sections, this
portion of the wall is relatively undamaged, save for a small fissure or
two stemming from the top.  To the southwest, a shiny golden building
dominates the landscape, reflecting an almost blinding light.  The path
here continues along the wall to the north and south, with the compound's
northern wall visible in the distance.  A short path to the west leads up
to a marble staircase, which appears to be the entrance to the golden
building.

few small cracks zig-zag their way down before stopping near the middle.

Along the Wall~
In need of much repair, the cinereous and battered eastern wall looks
like it has been through hell.  The crumbled ruins fall only half as high
as the rebuilt or untouched parts of the original wall.  The curvacity of
the damage and structural arrangement of the destruction leads a person
to possibly believe magic.  In contrast to the wary eastern ruins that
whispers death in a dusty, crippled voice, to the west there lies a
magnificent tree.  Appearing to be a type of oak, it towers probably
fifty feet or more easily.  Along the wall, the path continues south for
a good ways, while in the opposite direction it follows until it hits the
north wall.  The tree to the west blocks any passage that way.

Unblemished bark of deep silver and favilla, the entirety of the tree is
contrarily untouched by any sign of destruction unlike the wall not feet
away from it.  Whoever caused the destruction in the wall had no
intentions of hurting this oaken marvel.  The limbs soar overhead,
casting stick-figure shadows on the ground that dance around you in a sun

1 east wall ruins~
Falling in a crumbled heap, the earth-colored wall is speckled with
peices of ash and soot, as it flows gently to the ground like a foot hill. 
As bad as the destruction may seem, a pattern in it is faintly detectable
by a trained eye when examined more closely.  An ellipse of some sort can
be seen, a pattern too obvious once noticed to be caused by a brute force. 
No, this is definitely the work of magic.  Force combined with discipline
and similarity.

The vegetation here seems darker here than in other parts of the yard,
scorched and burned.  Blades of grass and other plant life that were once
former greenery have been incinerated, forming piles of ash and burnt
grass around the open area.  To the west, the backgrass area continues,
looking burned nearly as bad as here.  North and south follow alongside
the eastern wall of charred earth-colored stone.

The field opens up here, as it moves away from the building to the south
and statues to the west.  The grasses grow quite short, as if freshly cut. 
The lingering smell of smoke is heavy here, and you notice a mound of
ashes laying a bit to the side, probably the burned remains of once-high
grasses.  A few charred areas of ground are noticeable, but not as many
as other places have, leading you to believe this is one of the more
undisturbed parts.  A quaint-looking, gray stone birdbath stands on a
small hill nearby, an anomally in this drear and desolate place.

Backyard -- Near a Statue~
A proud statue stands near here, one of an ethereal-looking figure.  The
image glows and flickers as it dances, hardly looking solid.  The figure
is an evil looking man, dressed in black, and his fiery eyes are very
noticeable.  Near to the statue, on the ground not far from here, is a
chisel.  All around the statue, and even covering the chisel is a fine
black powder, probably from the sculpting of the base of the statue, as
it doesn't appear to be carved from rock.  A branch in the dirt path
leads directly to the south, to the steps of a magnificient golden
building.  Not far to the north is the north wall, looking reasonably
intact.

proud statue evil black fiery eyes~
A haunting statue that appears to almost be two-dimensional, seems to
float above a finely-carved black base.  The figure is cloaked in black,
and his fiery eyes are quite visibly vivid, looking like orbs of pure
flame.  He, himself, carries a wicked grin carved into his cold stone
face.
~
E
chisel~
A small chisel, no more than three-quarters of a foot long, lies on the
ground, collecting the black dust that fell scattered to the ground when
base of the statue was carved.  A simple wooden handle of maple and a
metal blade make it a well crafted tool, only slightly weathered and
rusted from exposure to weather.

1 south dirt path golden building~
Due south of here, accessed by a narrow dirt path, is the front of a
building made of solid gold.  The front steps lead up to a pair of
brilliant white doors.  Marble columns stand majestically on each side. 
If it looks anything on the inside like the outside, then this surely is
a place of sheer luxury.

Backyard -- Before a Towering Statue~
The air here is so thick and heavy that it is nearly impossible to
breathe, so permeated is it with evil.  Standing tall and proud to the
south is what can only be described as a statue created out of a sheer
void matter; neither metals nor stone can be seen, and no evidence of
any mortal hand in its creation.  The void is at once a fathomless depth
and merely two dimensional, though during its imperceptible shift between
these two extremes, it seems to remain constant in its shape of a hooded
man.  Set just below the edge of the hood are a pair of burning orbs that
mimic eyes in this dark creation, leading one to believe, if rumors are
true, that this is a statue of the dreaded Xharax.

Backyard -- Near a Statue~
Figures rise up from the level ground both to the east and south,
appearing to be magnificently built statues at first glance.  Obviously
these creations were carved from a uniformly black material, as evidenced
by both their absorption of light and the fine black powder scattered on
the ground.  The air is heavy almost as if an otherworldly weight were
pushing down on it; the feelings of evil are so prominent that it seems
to almost be a physical manifestation.  A small pathway appears to the
west heading both far deeper into the compounds heart or directly towards
a soaring archway.

Beside a Golden Building~
Dull, tarnished gold climbs skyward to the east, creating the outside
wall of a large building.  Set more than seven feet high into the wall is
an arched, partially intact window, the wrought-iron of its framework the
reason for its strength and durability.  Intricate carvings cover nearly
every available inch of the golden exterior, etched into a form of
flowing script.  A field of dried grass edges up to the wall of the
golden building and stretches towards the gravel pathway to the west.

Covering every available inch of the golden walls, the carvings are

whole wall, although it is difficult to tell if they are on the parts

Beside a Golden Building~
The path of rocks and dirt follows along the side of an exquisite
building of gold, leading northward and to the south, curving around to
the adjacent sides.  The base of the wall of the golden structure has a
few tufts of grass growing a foot or so in the air, and at about this
height, no farther up, the gold, appears a bit more orange and tarnished
looking.  A flowing script is visible from the highest point downward
until it disappears behind the standing grass.  The The script is
intrcately carved and the symbols and shapes seem to have definite
pattern, like a runic alphabet.

Wrapping around the entirety of the building, from the tip-top peak

Solid gold soars skyward to the east, creating the outer wall of a large
building.  At the base of the wall the gold is a tarnished, slightly-dull
brown, but transforms to a startalingly vibrant yellow near the top. 
Intricate carvings cover nearly every available inch of the golden
exterior, etched into a form of flowing script.  Set more than seven feet
above the ground, a large arched window, complete with a stylized
wrought-iron frame is the only break in the storytelling runes.  A short
distance to the north a pair of large statues can be seen, while to the
west a pathway parallels the walls of the golden structure.

Backyard -- Behind a Pair of Statues~
Blades of dried grass poke up through a carpet of black stone dust that
thickens as it approaches the backs of two towering statues to the north. 
Smoke wafts skyward from the glowing braziers that stand at the front
side of each of the demonic statues.  Remarkably even the back of these
statues shows an exquisite workmanship hinting at their true value.  A
short distance to the southeast a massive building of what appears to be
solid gold soars heavenward, reaching skyward in what seems to be an
attempt to stand taller than the outer walls.

Broken chisels, hammers and other stoneworking equipment lie strewn about
the sparse grass leading up to two, malevolent-looking statues.  Coupled
with the useless tools are literally hundreds of pounds of black opal
lying about, both in large chunks and mere dust, confirming that not only
are these newly created but works in progress.  Glowing braziers light
the area surrounding the twin statues, casting strange flickering shadows
to dance across the opal surface, enhancing the palpable radiation of
evil, emanating from the dark forms.  What appears to be another statue,
or more like a blackness that mimics a statue, stands just a short
distance to the northeast.

broken chisels hammers stoneworking sparse grass tools useless large chunks opal~
Laying in cluttered heaps, the latest in expensive sculpting tools are
scattered about the lawn amidst sparse patches of grass.  Fine, shiny
chisels, large and sturdy hammers, and a few other items to make the
roughest of form into a lifelike, silken figure with superfluous amounts
of meticulous details.  Beneath the statues are large chunks of the black
opal these figures are carved out of, the source of all the handy-work. 
At the bases, occasional pieces of opal dust get lifted in the wind from
the mounds of dust they once were apart of.  The tools were left here as
if dropped suddenly, as they do not look neatly arranged.  Yet, such nice
tools would probably have been covered in sheathing or brought in to
avoid rust or damage if the person using them had not rushed off so
suddenly, as it appears.  They are still here though, and the statues are
still a bit unfinished, so it is obvious it is a work and progress and
will be attented to when possible.

The grasses are short here, barely reaching the ankles.  The destruction
is great, large patches of former grass, mere black ashes on the ground. 
The lifeless landscape and chill, brisk gusts of wind make this an
unpleasant spot to linger.  Far in the distance the faint presence of a
pair of statues disturbs the horizon.  Westward a thick hedgerow lines
the path, barring passage in that direction.  The path follows the hedge

The wall of hedges to the west grows to the same vast width and height
from one end to there other, butting up against a wooden building to the
south and following a jog in the outer wall to the north.  A golden

light can be drawn from its surroundings.  Underfoot, the path runs along
the hedgerow northward, and skirts the wooden building to the south.

Backyard -- Behind a Towering Statue~
The air itself here is heavy in the shadow of not only two but three
towering statues that radiate evil.  A short distance to the southwest a
pair of statues stand tall, seems rising out of the ground itself, while
to the north a statue that seems to be part of another, more sinister
world, stands.  Although only the back of the statue to the north is
visible, its marvelous construction seems crafted from a sheer void of
matter, rather than mundane stone or metal.  It is at once both
fathomless in its depths and two-dimensional.

tower southwest statues 1 north~
A perceptible evil hangs in the air, making this wide open area seem
dark, cold and cavelike.  The three statues, all black in color, have
been crafted in very different ways and of very different substances.  A
pair of statues standing side by side have been chiselled from cold
stone, one slightly taller than the other.  Almost a hole in the air, the
other statue, although humanoid in shape, is the backbone of nightmares,
a sinister evil presence not a part of this reality.

Backyard -- Near the Golden Building~
A handful of saplings has taken root in the shadows of a large, golden
building to the south.  The small trees are numerous enough to force you
to walk around them in an effort to reach the white marble stairs, just a
short distant to the east.  Further hindering their growth, a pair of
towering statues, newly built, to the northwest blocks even more of the
life-giving rays that these trees thrive on.  The golden walls are
inscribed from top to bottom, seemingly in one flowing script that wraps
around the building, the only break in their lines a window set quite a
distant up on the wall.

Before the Grand Library~
A long line of steps leads up to a pair of shining doors set into the
front of a golden building that lies to the south.  The stairs have been
carved directly from a single slab of pure white marble, as no seams nor
mortar joints can be seen.  A large open book has been inscribed just
above the doors, dwarfing the rest of the neat inscriptions that have
been carved into the golden surface.  The carvings appear to be some sort
of flowing script, as there is a definite pattern to their curves.

A towering arch of gold forms the entrance to the south, the metal

marble, as white as new-fallen snow.  An inlay of gold forms an elegant
script on the marble, though in several places, the gold has been
forcibly stripped away.  The doors are pitted in many places, and most of
the gemstones that once augmented the delicate filigree carvings have
been pried out, leaving only gaping holes.

Rising up towards a pair of shiny marble doors, a solid, white marble
stairway blocks any movement to the west.  Neither seams nor mortar
joints can be seen in its construction, although a large fissure has
begun creeping along its lengths from the ground up.  The stairway itself
is dwarfed by the building that it leads to, a towering and yet elegant
building fashioned out of what might be solid, gold.  Every square inch
of the building is covered in inscriptions, save for a large rectangular
window set halfway up the walls height.  The carvings are in a flowing
script, which strikingly resemble some form of runic language.

Backyard -- Near a Pair of Statues~
Visions of contradicting proportions rise up out of the ground in all
directions.  To the south a mammoth building crafted out of solid gold
brings warmth to anyone resting his or her eyes on its almost blinding
glory.  To the southwest and northwest three statues of pure black stand,
darkening their surroundings and radiating a perceptible veil of evil. 
To the east, quite a distance off rises a magnificent oak, growing to
heights that dwarf even the outer walls of the compound.  Yet another
reminder that nature will not only rival but will defeat anything man
could make in beauty.

Three statues dominate the surrounding area, one to the northwest and

Backyard~
In plain view to the west, rising probably eight feet or so, a mysterious
statue of something definitely not human is apparent.  It flickers a bit,
and has an ethereal quality to it, raising the interest of anyone who
lays eyes upon it.  Rising high enough to the south to block view of
almost anything else in that direction, is a spectacular building of gold
with two beautiful white doors visible even from here.  The battered and
scorched wall to the east is a dull, earthen color, and when looked upon
as a whole reflects a tired, jaded look -- it has probably been through a
lot.  The path meanders in different directions; west it leads to the
statue, south to the golden building, and northeast to the east wall. 
Rising high to the east, blocking all passage, a magnificient tree that
is definitely a hard-wood, maybe an oak or elm, looks in unusually well
health.

At this distance, a lot can be noticed of the eastern wall.  For one, it
is covered in places where intense heat has caused the gray color to turn
very black and charred.  The high ramparts are crumbling in places,
making the wall-tops look hazardous.  A few fissures from the ground rise
up into it, indicating maybe an intense shaking of some sort took place
perhaps, in order to cause such cracks.

A large, impressive tapestry hangs along the eastern wall of this room,
the picture it bears extremely eye-catching.  The gold of the walls is
tarnished to a dull bronze color by smoke and ash, though surprisingly,
little else in the room shows any signs of devastation.  Marble shelves
line the north and south walls, the books and scrolls they bear showing
no signs of destruction at all.  Colored patterns of light dance across
the floor, a glance towards the ceiling revealing the source of the
mosaic of light to be a large skylight of stained glass.  Comfortable
chairs are placed about the room, providing a cozy resting place for any
wishing to browse the knowledge held within these walls.  An intricately
carved golden archway leads to the entranceway towards the west.

A very large tapestry, woven of the finest silks, linens, and cottons,
hangs lazily on the eastern wall, covering most of it.  The tapestry's
background is midnight black, making the foreground colors vivid and real. 
The scene is two figures, dark and terrifying.  One has horns, the other
has eyes of pure fire, and both are cloaked in black, with wicked leers
painted across their faces.  Outstretched fingers nearly touching,
together they raise their hands to the sky where a crackling ball rolls
through the sparkling ether, anxiously waiting to be unleashed on some
hapless victim.  Overhead, the upper half of a figure is visible,
stitched with threads that make it seem transluscent.  The figure has
eyes even more fiery and red than the figures below it, and a look more
evil than the pair's combined.  The pale moon at the peak of the weaving
limns the iridescent figures, their nefarious auras shining black and
deep red in its wan glow.  Two craters, barely seen when looking at the
moon, lie above a series of smaller ones, that when studied from a
distance bear a marked resemblance to a skull.  At the bottom of the
hanging, sewn neatly in yellow, is the letter M and below that, AH.

Polished arches of gold frame the entrance to the east.  The gold plating
of the walls has been stripped away in several places, revealing the
smooth white marble beneath.  The deep sapphire blue carpets are somewhat
singed, as though embers of flame had fallen, yet quickly put out.  Along
the western wall, a window seat once provided patrons of this library a
cozy nook in which to read or enjoy a view of the lovely courtyard,
though now, only a vista of desolation is visible.  Globes of soft white
mage-light provide a gentle glow to illuminate the chamber, their gleam
reflected in the golden panels of the walls.  Several small tables lie
about the room, various books and scrolls lying open upon them.  A faint,
musty smell of ancient tomes lingers in the air.

Simple wooden tables, chestnut in color, are neatly positioned about the

Two immense pillars of black marble rise gracefully to the vaulted
ceiling on either side of this elegant hallway.  The walls are plated
with pure gold, carved with an intricate runic script, though often the
gold has been chipped away, revealing the alabaster-white stone beneath. 
Plush sapphire blue carpeting lines the hallway under your footsteps,
cushioning them.  Several ivory pedestals stand sentinel on both sides of
the hall, though all of them bear some signs of discoloration from heat
and smoke.  The statuary upon the pedestals is demonic in nature,
portraying all manner of imps and devils, and quite out of place in what
was once a refuge of elegant serenity.  Silver archways mark the entrance
to rooms on the east and west, though the delicate filigree carvings
which once adorned them are badly scarred by scratches and gaping holes
where once gemstones were set.

Slender ivory pedestals, quite obviously a remnant of days long since

the white color is still clear.  On each pedestal sits a devilish imp,
carved of a deep ebony stone.  The pose each figure holds is unique, but
all share the same mischievous grin. The statue's eyes are set with
flaming red gems, which glitter brilliantly in any light.

Elegant columns of blackest marble, smooth and cold to the touch, rise
all the way to the ceiling high above, but do not seem to be supporting
it in any way.  Curiously, red veins run through the marble, giving these
pillars an otherworldly look.  The columns are gracefully designed, the
stone from which they are carved completely without flaw or blemish. 
Near the top of each pillar, a demonic face has been carved, each with a
disconcertingly evil leer forever frozen in the chill stone.

Gleaming silver forms arches leading to the east and west.  The archways
themselves are beautifully carved with a pattern of intertwining roses

Many of the delicate crystals have been gouged away, however, and the
intricate rose pattern is heavily marred by deep scratches where hunks of
the silver metal have been clawed away.

The devastation in this room is almost breathtaking.  Splinters of
furniture litter the floor, which is nearly stripped of its once plush
carpeting.  Shattered glass is strewn about the floor, and it looks
rather as if an explosion had gone off in the center of the room.  In a
couple places along the walls, the golden plating seems melted slightly,
with tiny rivulets of the metal running down the wall like blood from an
angry wound.  Books and scrolls are scattered haphazardly upon the
blackened shelves, several of them singed and partially burned.  Several
shelves of manuscripts lean heavily against the walls, their battered
frames seeming too weary to stand unaided.  The bookcase on the southern
wall, however, seems perfectly intact, with most of the books it bears
neatly arranged.  Strangely out of place amidst the destruction, sparkles
of colored light dance a merry pattern upon the chaos, streaming in from
the stained glass skylight above.

The tomes it bears are all intact and neatly aligned on their shelves,

Library Room~
Row upon row of shelves fill this room, each stacked with many scrolls
and tomes containing the knowledge of years past.  Though many of the
room's once elegant furnishings have been singed by flames, the
manuscripts themselves are strangely untouched, surviving the chaos to
which the rest of the room seems to have subjected.  Once beautiful wall
hangings have been ripped to shreds by knives and other weaponry, and
replaced with hideous banners of ebony and crimson bearing the crest of
Xharax.  Even the mage-lights which illumine the area seem to flicker as
if ashamed to look upon the destruction which was wreaked upon this place. 
Several scrolls lie open on the burned and battered tables, giving
evidence of recent study.

The banners are woven of only the best quality silks.  Blacker than a

amber shelves, catagorized by subject.  The elegant, archaic script which

tree~
and when I reached Medienne, I became the guest of an old man, a
teacher who had abundant wealth and a handsome, learned son.  One night
he told me that he had, in all his life, no other child but this boy,
although he went often to a hidden, sacred tree and prayed for more
children to be granted to his wife.  I overheard the boy whispering to
his companion, also at the table with us.  "How good it would be if I
knew where that tree is that I might pray for my father to die." It was
then I realized the truth of things, that those who delight in the
intelligence of their companions often stand to lose much by that same
intelligence.
~
E
wanderer~
@cKnowest thou not why I in foreign countries
Roamed for long years?
I went away from the distress of the llewyrr because I saw
The world entangled like the snarled hair of a slattern;
They were all noble beings, but
Like cats sharp-clawed, for shedding blood
When I returned I saw Medienne destroyed, the humans in their
Peace with my kinsmen, their country at rest,
The tigers having abandoned the nature of tigers.
Within their nation they were of good disposition, like angels,
And yet without like a fierce army of savage beasts, even still.
Such do the tensions exist, and such shall we pass on to
Our children, who will carry out our hatred for unknown reasons.
Thus it happened that first I beheld
The world full of confusion, anxiety and distress;
Then it became as it was in the days of the Spanning.@n
~
E
richard~
whereupon I advanced with my companions into the city.  There we met
the one of whom we were told, the man who is commonly called Lord Richard
by the Humans, a man learned, just, aided by the heavens, victorious,
supporter of the throne of the King and councillor in deliberations of
the realm, refuge of the poor, asylum of strangers, patron of the learned
men, lover of the pious, glory of the dynasty of Mankind, right hand of
the kingdom, chief of the nobles, boast of the monarchy and of the
religion, succour of Medienne and of the Humans, buttress of kings and
priests.  He, the son of Andime lo'Riste, this Lord Richard born well and
named Ryxar lo'Riste at his star-day, may Cynnis prolong his life,
augment his dignity, enlighten his breast and increase his reward
twofold, because he enjoys the praise of all great men and is the
embodiment of every laudable quality.  Whoever reposes in the shadow of
his favour, his sin is transmuted to obedience and his foe into a friend.

This is how we found again our lord and master.

Every attendant and follower of our lord has an appointed duty and if, in
the performance thereof, he gives way to remissness and indolence, he is
certainly called to account and becomes subject to reproaches.
~
E
philosopher~
and he proceeded to relate this story to me:

A caravan of wealthy and stingy men was once plundered in the Pennan
valley and deprived of boundless wealth.  The merchants of the caravan
wept and lamented, beseeching the goddess Algesa to intercede for them
with the robbers, to no avail.  Qe-rohn, the philosopher lately come from
Orlumber, was asked to speak wisdom unto the theives so that they might
return some of the property that was stolen.  Qe-rohn replied: "It would
be lamentable to utter one word of wisdom to them.  The rust which has
eaten into iron cannot be removed by polishing.  Of what use is preaching
to a black heart?  An iron nail cannot be driven into a rock.  Help the
distressed in your day of propserity because comforting the poor averts
evil from thyself.  When a medicant implores thee for a thing, give it or
else an oppressor may take it by force." 
~
E
journal~
@cFrom the journal of Thessalie Am'rhani@n

Despite the abundant admonitions of my father to shun musical
entertainments and to prefer solitude and retirement, the budding of my
youth overcame me, my sensual desires were excited so that, unable to
resist them, I walked some steps contrary to the opinion of my father,
enjoying myself in musical amusements and convivial meetings.  When the
advice of my father occurred to my mind, I said "If the priest was
sitting with us, he would clap his hands.  If the priestess were sipping
wine, she would excuse a drunkard." 

Thus I lived til I paid one night a visit to an assembly of people in
which I saw a musician, and it was decided that night that I become a
bard to lead with my harp the llewyrr armies against the men of the town
of Medienne....

Library Hall~
A carved ivory curio cabinet dominates the wall to the south.  Neatly
arranged on the shelves behind its glass doors are many rare and precious
artifacts, and manuscripts which appear so ancient as to crumble at the
lightest touch.  Soft mage-lights cast a gentle glow upon these
treasures, illuminating them as they nestle into the soft black velvet in
which they are cased.  A pair of hideous gargoyles perch atop black
marble columns, one on either side of the hallway, their evil leers quite
unsettling.  Intricately carved arches of silver open up to the east and
west.

cabinet curio case~
A massive cabinet of age-darkened ivory rests against the southern wall. 
The whole of its surface is carved with intricate patterns of unicorns
and pegasi dancing through fields of flowers.  The front panels of the
cabinet are made of glass, allowing passers-by to view the treasures
stored within.
~
E
gargoyles columns~
Two perfectly devilish gargoyles grin down over the room from their
perches high atop the columns of stone.  The creatures are quite large,
each almost the size of a dwarf or halfling.  Masterfully sculpted wings
arch over the hunched, deformed-looking backs, and thin lips are pulled
back from a mouthful of sharp fangs in a demonic grin.  The gargoyles are
formed from ebony stone so dark it seems to pull away the surrounding
light to forever drown in the depths of its blackness.
~
E
arches silver~
Silver archways open to the east and west, allowing entrance to more of
the library's study rooms.  The gleaming metal seems carved from one
large block of silver, as there are no visible seams in the arches.  An
intricate pattern of intertwined roses and ivy leaves decorates the
elegant doorways, the delicate filigree scarcely damaged save for the
fact that many of the faceted crystals which once adorned the leaves have
been pried away.

Library Room~
A plush, beautifully woven rug carpets this room in soft luxury.  Shelves
of polished, amber-colored wood line the walls, each bearing many tomes of
ancient lore.  Several of the shelves are slightly blackened by the touch
of flames, though the books themselves are carefully preserved. 
Prominently displayed on the northern wall is the midnight black banner
of Xharax, the lava-red eyes of the crimson skull it bears ever vigilant
in their unsleeping watch.  In one corner of the room, a few potted
plants once grew, though these have long since withered from neglect. 
The musical sound of babbling water trickles from beside the plants, its
source a small marble fountain.

The banner is rather large, its blazing presence one of the most easily
noticed things in this otherwise demure room.  A flaming skull glares
down from a sea of deepest black velvet, an evil grin on its skeletal
face.  The banner is edged by a border of pure gold thread, its
glittering color a stark contrast to the field of midnight it surrounds. 
Golden threads also border the tongues of flame embroidered around the
crimson skull, outlining them in an almost life-like fashion.
~
E
plants~
What types of plants once grew in this secluded corner is uncertain now,
so faded and withered is their foliage.  The cerulean blue and gold urns
in which the plants once flourished are cracked and faded, their
prettily-painted designs barely discernable beneath a layer of grime.  A
few brown and dying leaves still cling tenaciously to the sketetal
remains of the plants, and many more litter the floor around the ceramic
urns.  Oddly enough, one deep crimson flower grows in the very center of
the dying mess of vegetation, untouched by the decay.  The single blossom
is elegant in its simplicity, its petals velvety soft and fairly glowing
with health.  Tucked away behind the dying greenery is a small statue of
a cherub, cracked and broken into an almost unrecognizable array of
pieces.

The rug is quite large, a rich, creamy amber in color, unlike the

adorn the elaborate carpeting, which in itself is a story of sorts.  One
edge of the rug is slightly frayed, though otherwise the whole of it
seems to bear no damage.  Along the frayed edging, a thin strip of the

Library Room~
An ivory and gold border runs along the top of the walls, bearing the
scrolls and tomes, the lore of times long past.  Soft mage-lights provide
illumination for anyone wishing to read or study, the glow they cast
never glaring, but always providing ample light.  A large windowed panel
ran across the western wall at one time, however nearly every pane of the
glass has been broken, the shattered fragments littering the soft
sapphire carpeting.  Pieces of pastel colored silks are strewn around
randomly, evidence of a tapestry, perhaps, or a set of draperies which
once graced this chamber.

The bordered panel is about a foot in height, and reaches all the way

The western wall of this chamber is panelled almost completely in glass,
though the majority of the panels have been shattered, leaving only

the chaos is present.  In the corner of one of the broken glass panels, a

Along the Wall~
The sense of apprehension is strong, as the path makes a perpendicular
corner in the northwestern part of the compound.  Feelings of wrongness
accompany a sense of being constantly watched...an uncomfortable feeling
at best.  The path is quite in the open here, with much of the compound
visible.  Dirt flies up loosely from the path here, blowing and spinning
against the western wall.  To the south the path disappears around a
corner to the west.  The path continues eastward for a good ways, the
eastern wall barely visible in the distance.  The trees that border the
western wall do not seem to be present on the north wall, as the area
along the northern walls seems to have been a bit more put to use.

The northern wall junctions with the western wall, coming to a

cut through the air with a frightening smoothness, making light whistling
sounds that resemble a laugh.  The sheer openness of the road presents a
sense of discomfort.

The path continues here along the northern wall both east and west for a
good ways.  To the west, an inset in the wall is noticeable, blocked by
an pair of matching portals.  Near the northern wall, a skull half
protrudes from a mound of dirt, a few bleached bones scattered around it. 
Flies buzz about in their usual manner, their incessant drone even more
irritating than usual to the senses.  To the south the rest of the
compound can be seen, although few details can be determined from the
distance.

A broken skull is half-buried in a low mound of dirt, lying in the shadow

Along the Wall~
The ground here isn't level but rather built up against the wall a good
three feet, creating a gently sloping incline.  From atop the mound,
there is a nearly-clear view of the rest of the compound and its
buildings and landscape.  The building to the southwest is a simple,
two-story structure of dark wood.  Underfoot, the path continues to both
the east and west, following the outer wall.  Three other buildings can
be seen -- one of glinting gold, one a pristine ivory tower, and the
other a stark black building that lies directly to the south.

ground level slope summit~
At least three feet higher here than the surrounding ground, a good sized mound
of dirt has been built up against the wall, creating a small hill.  The
ground here is hard, packed down well when the mound was built up. 
Standing at its peak, a slightly better view of the area can be obtained
then the one at ground level.  Of course, even with the hill at the
wall, reaching the top of these immensely high walls is not even close.

Off to the southwest a good ways, a simple structure very dark in

Along the Wall~
This packed dirt path runs east and west alongside the compound's
northern wall.  The ash-colored stones of the wall appear to be
relatively untouched here, with only a few chips broken out of the
otherwise smooth stones.  Evidence of various animal life lies alongside
the path: tiny bits of leftover food scraps, shreds of discarded paper,
and many small footprints in the looser sections of dirt.  The path also
branches off to the south, towards a golden building with a marble
staircase a moderate distance away.

Along the Wall~
The compound wall to the north is covered with the scars of battle,
though some patches are covered in fresh mortar and dull paint.  Lined up
against the grey stone are barrels of various sizes and shapes, most of
them seriously damaged and long since emptied.  The path that runs along
the wall to the east and west intersects with a smaller path running
south towards the heart of the complex.

Lined up against the gray stone wall to the north are a cluster of

to be quite used, as some appear broken or cracked from abuse and age.  A
few have lids missing, but it is impossible to tell if something is in or
was in their shadowy depths.  About the bottoms of the barrels are an

Along the Wall~
The paths from both the west and south come together here in the
northeast corner of the compound.  The large stone walls to the north and
east show minimal damage, with bits of fallen rock and dirt strewn along
the path from above.  Large crisscrossing, beams lashed together to form
scaffolding, make their way up the wall, signs of rebuilding what was
probably at one time worse than this.  Off to the west, the path follows
the northern wall as far as the eye can see; southward, the path leads
towards a golden building in the distance.  A narrow set of steps has
been built next to the wall here, providing a treacherous staircase to
the ramparts above.

North of a Quartz Gate~
You stand before a gateway carved directly into earthen-colored walls
that spread out to both the east and west.  The gate is not immense by
any standards, just allowing a person on horseback to clear the archway. 
Although not tall, the gateway is wide, allowing for the passage of large
wagons.  A pair of crystalline doors poised within the archway hang as if
by magic, as no hinges can be seen nor any other mechanical device which
could open and close these crystalline doors.  The doors are covered in
dark smudges reminescent of the after affects of great magical fires,
coupled with this are long gashes physically hacked into the quartz.

and the twin quartz doors still hang as if by magic.

Beside the Wall~
Standing in the southwestern corner of the compound, a wall rises both to
the south and the west.  Chiseled directly into the western is a narrow
stairway, leading steeply to the top of the ramparts.  Moss covers most
of the staircase in dull, green patches unbroken by any footprints,
indicating that not oft in recent years have any made this ascent. 
Sporadic crumbling of some of the steps shows a slow deterioration in
this part of the complex.

Expertly crafted into the walls of the compound, the stairway rises

A soaring tower of seamless ivory rises to the east, stretching far into
the sky.  Covering the first twenty feet of so of the pearlescent wall,
numerous deep scratches and patches of black soot mar the pristine
surface.  Jutting from the alabaster wall near the top of the tower, a
balcony offers a panoramic view of the surrounding compound.  Centered at
the pinnacle of the spire, an old rune has been cut into the smooth,
polished stone-like substance.  To the west lies the earthen-colored

Beside the Wall~
Rising more than twenty feet into the air, the outer wall of the compound
turns sharply to the east, throwing long shadows across the dusty,
near-barren soil.  Here the wall is heavily damaged, quite unlike other
more sturdy sections that have withstood the test of time.  One
particularly large area seems to have melted, the flow of molten rock
oozing toward the ground to solidify at ground level into a sloping mound
of stone.

Balcony~
Rising slightly higher than the outer wall, the tower and its situated
balcony offer a majestic view of their surrounds, clear to the horizon
itself.  The ground lying on the outside of the walls can not be seen,
leaving the eerie impression that the stronghold is afloat in mid-air. 
Looking back at the rising tower, an intricate rune has been carved into
the ivory marble directly at the apex of the archway, leading back inside. 
An errant arrow has penetrated the exact center of this arcane symbol,
forever destroying its consistency.  The ground beneath the balcony lies
far below; a painful but not deadly fall.

In an odd contrast, the ramparts here appear to have seen no action in
previous battles, while to the south the wall is all but breached, with a
large chunk of it completely blown away.  Perhaps the lack of damage to
the wall is due to this segment of the wall being out of range of any war
machines which could have been moved along the road to the southeast. 
The ground outside of the wall here is fairly wide, vectoring out towards
the road, yet narrowing again towards the extreme northeastern corner of
the compound.  The roof-top roadway is blocked to the south by a gaping
hole where the wall was breached, the only way across would be a
death-defying leap, though the path to the north is still accessible.

Obvious repair work has been recently finished in this section of the
wall, little to no effort having been made in covering up the fact. 
Fresh mortar, a pale gray in color stands out against the standard dark
earthen-colored rock of the original wall.  The mortar was not applied in
any semblence of neatness, but instead slathered about the wall anywhere
even a small fissure was evident.  This section of the wall offers a
beautiful view of the golden building within the compound proper just to
the west, the wall being close enough to almost allow a daredevil to leap
to its roof.

This segment of the wall and those northward would seem to have little
useful defensive value if an attack on the compound were imminent.  The
ground outside of the wall to the east is scarcely visible, so close is
the dropoff to the outer wall that any more than a few men would have a
difficult time of walking side by side.  This position does offer a good,
if not far away, view of the eastern road quite a distance to the
southeast.  Perhaps more commonly viewed though would be the large
building that appears to be made out of solid gold just within the
compound proper to the west.  Its shiny golden surface would be nearly
blinding in full daylight, and perhaps even so in some moonlight.

Standing out in contrast to the section of the wall to the north, little
to no damage appears to have reaped upon this segment of the ramparts. 
Small chunks of rubble are evident, sporadically tossed about on the
wall-top roadway, no doubt coming from the decimated section to the north. 
The ramparts here are still completely usable as both a defensive
position and an observation stand.  The ground just outside of the outer
wall has begun to vector outward to the road to the southeast, while to
the north the ground drops away just at the base of the wall itself.

Decimated Ramparts~
Extensive damage scarcely covers the description of this section of the
outer wall.  The wall is barely standing and is no longer at its full
original height.  The destruction of the wall does not appear to have
come from any war machine, nor mortal hand.  Instead, the lack of rubble
and the totality of the damage leads one to suspect magic was the culprit. 
The wall itself has crumbled down onto itself to stand at just barely
taller than half its original height.  The once naturally rough stones
have been smoothed down to a glossy sheen, and are covered in a black
soot.  A slight climb to either the north or south will bring you back to
the full height of the outer walls.

The entirety of this section of the wall is covered with a dark black
soot, giving the impression of an out of control fire burning along the
ramparts.  No other visible damage is evident as the wall itself still
appears to be wholely intact with only minor fissures appearing only at
the very top of the wall.  Staring out over the wall, only a small amount
of land is accessible on the outside of the wall, though the plateau does
widen out toward the south.  The wall-top roadway continues to both the
north and south, though the wall to the south does not appear to be safe

Heavy construction efforts are obviously underway on this section of the
outer wall.  Crisscrossing beams of repair-work scaffolding stand
attached to wall by various means, from generic ropes and grapples to
heavy-gauged spikes driven deep into the wall's surface.  A vast majority
of the early repair-work appears to have been completed for the sole
reason of saving the wall from collapse, but newly completed work is
evident at the pinnacle of the ramparts; stone pillars designed to shield
archers while they fire volley after volley into their enemies.

Brave or perhaps foolhardy workers would trust their lives to the mass of

across the plateau would mean that the various wooden planks, some of

Squat and functional, the architect of the pillars cared little for

The cold stones that make up the floor and ramparts are a dull earthen
color.  The ground below has the look of a high traffic area, probably
the result of guards rushing back and forth along the wall-top road.  The
ramparts rise up a bit higher than the height of the walkway, giving the
archers and scouts up here plenty of shielding or cover from enemies on
the outside, as well as a nice place to launch an arrow into someone's
back without them noticing you.  Looking south into the compound, the
whole overview of it can be made out through the dense air, a whole set

Looking down over the ramparts to the north, the sides of the steep rocky
plataeu fall sharply until they reach the bottom, not smoothing out one
bit.  Rocks occasionally fall from where they were lodged, rolling
swiftly down.  The ground underfoot has not seen a good washing, and has
collected dirt and grime.  Ramparts of the same earthen hue as the rest
of the compound rise up above the walkway underfoot, giving archers a
sniper's advantage when picking off possible enemies.  The walltop path

open to all directions, the only reason to even call it a tower would be
the small roof, which stands a mere eight feet off of the surface of the
wall.  It was created to stand for many generations, with its four small
support pillars crafted to remain unseen from the ground below.  A small
covered firepit, overflowing with ashes, has been carved directly into
the side of the wall, allowing for a small amount of heat to radiate out
and still prevent light from giving away the position of anyone warming

Silently flying over the walls of the compound, twin flags alert even the

Xharax, the flaming eyes of the skull on the flag stare out over both
the northern road and the compound proper.  The second flag, hanging ever

Staring out over the ramparts, the wide mountain road to the north is
wholely visible.  This medium-sized guard tower is open to both the east
and west, though a very short distance to the west, the roadway along the
wall-tops is totally demolished.  A small roof, made from the same
earthen-colored rock as the walls offers some semblence of comfort to a
weary guard on a rainy night.  Coupled with this shelter, a small fire
pit has been cunningly crafted into the wall itself, to allow for a small
amount of heat without giving off any light to an observer on the

Edge of the Demolished Ramparts~
Chunks of rock lie intermingled with shards of bone and slivers of metal
that appear to be sword blades.  All three of these seem to be scorched
and melted into an altogether physical mass by what could only have been
a startingly hot fire.  No doubt the wall here used to vector in towards
the south, but instead the ramparts have been all but destroyed leaving
only a line of trees as the sole outer barrier for the compound proper. 
The wall-top road heads off towards the east, directly towards a small
guardhouse overlooking the northern compound gate.

chunks rock bone shards slivers metal~
Gruesome indeed is this garbled conglomeration of rubble.  Many of the
pieces of rock look melted around the edges, granite joining with marble
in an unnatural union.  Rusty metal slivers which may once have been
bladed weapons are scattered about randomly, obviously no protection
against a disaster of the magnitude of the one which caused this hideous
burning.  Long shards of a yellowed, organic material that could only be
aged bone lie strewn haphazardly throughout the area, adding a sense of
the macabre.  Nestled against the wall, a bit of bone barely recognizable
as a hand clenches tightly to the useless hilt of a sword, rivulets of
once-molten metal dripping down across the bones.

Along the Ramparts~
Over the ramparts, a stunning view can be seen of a sheer drop off the
mountainside below.  At this height, low-lying clouds would obscure the
view of any enemies approaching, although the sheer cliff face would be
almost impossible to mount an attack from.  The vibrant white walls of
the ivory tower to the east reach a height just a few feet higher than
the actual wall, allowing for someone on the tower's balcony to have a
view over the walls.  The rooftop road continues a very short distance to
the north and towards a staircase to the courtyard to the south.

The destruction is nearly complete in this section of the ramparts.  The
northward-lying wall has apparently run molten and sunk to a level far
below its surroundings, cutting off the walkway in that direction. 
Outside the compound, a sheer cliff face drops off vertically, making
seige or mundane assault from that direction impossible.  Southward the
path atop the walls continues unhampered, free from any wholesale
devastation.

Ancient Road~
Packed down by countless years of use, the dirt on this road is as hard
as natural rock.  The vast majority of this plateau is dark stone, with
little soil to give plants a chance at survival.  Ruts and hoof prints
mar the otherwise level surface of this road, hinting that the road has
been heavily traveled at some point in time.  The road travels to the
north towards the vast expanse of a towering outer wall and southward
toward the very edge of the plateau.

An ancient road winds down the side of the mountain below, its purpose to
bring visitiors to the top of this inhospitable plateau.  A cold wind
blows harshly as if nature itself did not feel comfortable with mortal
feet at the top of this road.  A short distance to the north, at the end
of this packed dirt road, stand earthen-colored walls.  Towering more
than twenty feet into the air, the vast battlements are the outer barrier
to some large stronghold.

Cliffs Edge~
Though slightly jagged, the ground drops off in an almost straight line
heading from the edge of a packed dirt road towards the corner of a
walled compound to the north.  As if it were meant to be there, the
plateau appears to be just large enough to house the walled structure,
with barely any ground outside of its towering walls.  Little loose dirt
appears to be evident on this rocky plateau, making vegetation a near
impossibility in this inhospitable area.  A slightly cold wind blows
constantly at this height atop the mountain.

Dropping off in a sheer descent, the ground vears inward as it travels
north toward a twenty-foot high earthen-colored stone wall.  Perfectly
placed, the walled compound to the north fills nearly the entirety of
this mountain-top plateau.  Little to no loose dirt is evident on this

Towering, earthern-colored walls rise up from the same dark colored

be evident, the little that is forms a thin layer of silt at the base of
the seamless walls.  A chill wind howls through the mountain tops and
valleys, buffeting the stone-worked battlements in a never ending battle
with nature.  A packed dirt road runs north and south to the east, from
the plateau's edge to a pair of crystalline doors that grant passage into
the compound.

Barren and windswept, this plateau shows all the wear that this

ground of this rocky plateau and the earthen-colored walls to the north
alike, without discrimination.  What little soil used to thinly cover
this ground is gone, lying in a small layer at the base of the walls of
the compound.  A packed dirt road runs north and south a short distance
to the west, while to the west the edge of the cliff looms grimly.

Just capable of being classified as a ledge, this small rocky outcropping
nearly butts completely up to a stone wall to the north.  Looking either

to the base of the mountain and a breathtaking view of the neighboring
peaks and valleys.  The wall to the north is an exact color as the ground

one ends and the other begins.  To the west the plateau widens as it
approaches a hard-packed road running north and south.

tussock~
Dusty-brown clumps of tussock grass bend and wave, stirred up by the icy
mountain winds that howl across the lands.  Growing to little over a foot
in height, they form a patchwork of brown and white as they cover most of
the rocky landscape.
~
E
cairn~
The plentiful boulders have been stacked into a large pile, froming a
cairn.  Built some time ago, the cairn has become covered in moss and
lichen.  A few pine saplings sprout from its base, using the rocks as
shelter from the harsh mountain winds.

pine saplings~
The stunted saplings struggle to grow in the harsh mountain conditions. 
Bent and twisted from constant winds the little trees barely reach the
top of the cairn.

Ancient Road~
As it winds up the mountainside, the road becomes increasingly more
poorly maintained.  Larger rocks have tumbled down from slips and
partially blocked it in several places.  Cascading down the side of the
mountain are several small, fast flowing streams.  At several points they
become tiny waterfalls, sending misty spay across the road and rocks,
creating unsteady footing.  Red lichen covers the majority of rubble,
growing where even the hardy tussock cannot.

streams~
Hurtling down the mountainside, splash several fast flowing streams.  The
icy waters cut into the softer rocks leaving deep groves.  The gurgling
of the stream mingles with the clatter of pebbles dancing down the
watercourse.

E
red lichen~
Spreading over the broken ground in a thick blanket, the reddish-brown
lichen seems to flourish in these harsh conditions.  Gaining nutrients
from the rocks and broken land, it slowly gives support to the soil to
allow larger plants to take root.  Tussock clumps cover the mountainside;
they require better growing conditions than the lichen but still
outnumber any other plants here.

Ancient Road~
Cutting its way upward, the steep slope is a rubble-strewn road.  In
barely better condition than the cliff it ascends, it is in a bad need
of some maintenance.  A way marker lies cracked and broken on the ground,
its writing so faded it leaves no clue where the road once led.  Covering
the mountainside are small daisies and clumps of wiry tussock.

There is a weathered wooden sign hammered into the ground beside the road.

way marker~
The way marker has been cut from a white and black flecked stone into the
shape of a small arch.  Although there was once writing engraved into it,
the weather has erased any chance of reading what it said.

E
dasies~
With small fur-covered leaves and little height to its stem, the alpine
daises minimize their exposure to the harsh winds that sweep down the
mountainside.  The bright yellow and white flowers are much smaller than
their lowland cousins, the need to keep more reserves for winter meaning
less energy to spend in flowering.
~
E
tussock~
Much hardier than most grasses, they have little competition as the tawny
plants make their home across much of the mountainside where other plants
could not survive.  Small birds and rodents often use the clumps as nests
and burrows, sheltering from the icy winds.
~
E
sign~
The sign reads:

If you are just beginning your adventuring life or if you are unskilled
in the higher combat tactics, avoid the road up this mountainside.  There
are life-endangering perils there.
