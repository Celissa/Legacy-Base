A Path Through a Dense Forest~
A trampled path zigzags its way through a forest of densely packed trees. 
Coating the trees, a thick matting of shaggy green moss conceals much of
the bark.  Long branches covered with countless broad, green leaves
stretch outward from the trunks, shielding most of the forest from the
bright light of a blazing bonfire flickering to the east.  Leading
slightly uphill, the path continues to the west behind the veil of
branches, that which lies beyond completely hidden from view.

densely packed trees~
Towering oaks dominate the landscape, standing at least thirty feet tall. 
Perhaps centuries old, these trees have a thick, healthy layer of tan
bark.  High above the ground, their thick branches and dense foliage
block out the entire view from above, draping the area in darkness.
~
E
shaggy matting green moss~
Clinging to the side of the trees like a second skin, a thick layer of
spongy lime-green moss clings tenaciously to the cracks and crevices of
the craggy bark.  Moist to the touch and extremely soft, the stringy
lichen glows dimly in the otherwise pitch black forest.

A Hastily-Erected Guard Post~
The paths through the forest open up into a modest clearing here, where a
crude guard post has been erected to alert the camp in case of intruders. 
A makeshift hot rock pit has been built in a way to keep the area warm,
yet prevent escaping light from giving away the guard's position.  Rows
of broken branches have been placed on the ground to trip up the unwary. 
Narrow paths lead off to the north and south, while a wider thoroughfare
continues into a clearing to the east.

crude guard post~
Rocks have been dug from the soil and stacked together to create a
hastily-built hasty guard post for temporary encampment.  A lower pyramid
of stones lies over a bed of hot coals, allowing some warmth into the
chill air, yet preventing escaping light from giving away the camp's
location.  A single large stone rests against a magestic oak, its purpose
not readily apparent.
~
E
makeshift hot rock pit~
Numerous melon-shaped rocks have been stacked one on top of the other,
forming a small pyramid-shaped cairn, with a glowing bed of coals within
warming up the guard post.  Built in such a way to prevent escaping
light, the rock pit raises the temperature of the otherwise dark, chill
forest by a healthy margin.
~
E
rows broken branches trap~
A primitive trap of stripped tree limbs lies on the ground, perpendicular
to the pathway that enters the forest from the east.  Due to the
darkness, it would be easy to miss the slippery limbs and trip over them,
creating more than a little ruckus.  Between each row of branches, there
is enough room to fit a large boot.  Evidently, the kobolds are not
expecting enough company to their encampment to warrant a more complex
warning system.

Path Around a Great Oak Tree~
The path wraps around a great oak here, winding off toward the south. 
The rutted trail is littered with twisted roots and sharp rocks; with
visibility no further than arms length, navigation is treacherous.  The
smell of burning wood lingers in the air, riding a slight air movement
out of the south.  A single strand of whitish moss hangs from a tangle of
branches in the canopy, like the windless sail of a tiny ship lost amid
an endless ocean of greens, browns, and ambers.

oak tree~
Its bark cracked and covered with a leafy grey-white lichen, the old oak
has stood watch over this part of the forest for countless years. 
Doubtless she is the mother of the surrounding trees, having watched them
fall, as acorns, from her great boughs.  Her branches twist and tangle
with her offsprings in the canopy above, hoarding the sunlight and
leaving little leftover for floor-dwelling flora.
~
E
moss whitish white strand~
Draped down over a cluster of branches that jut out from the side of the
great oak, a long clump of whitish moss limply hangs in mid-air. 
Deposited on the branches after drifting in on a gust of wind, the shaggy
growth does not match the color of any of the surrounding trees.  Though
firmly dangling from the tree, it appears quite brittle and dried.

A Winding Path Next to a Great Oak Tree~
Squeezed in tightly between the densely packed trees, the narrow path of
trampled foliage winds its way to the east and west.  The forest floor is
covered in a layer of dead, dried leaves, matted into a thick mulch that
slowly decomposes on the ground.  A weak rotting stench emanates from the
composting material, leaving a lingering odor in the air.  An immense oak
towers skyward to the south, its breadth and dense branches filtering
most of the light from above.  A particularly large limb juts out from
the side of the tree at shoulder-height, slightly obstructing the path.

dead dried leaves ground thick mulch~
A thick layer of dried leaves, fallen from the treetops, has
settled on the ground and begun to decompose.  Emanating a weak
stench from its composting, the mulch is slightly warm and damp to the
touch.  Numerous twigs poke out of the deep layer at intermittent
intervals, broken off of the trees by careless passersby.
~
E
immense oak tree~
Vast in girth, this huge oak dominates the view of the forest in
comparison to the smaller trees surrounding it.  A thick layer of dark
bark slowly peels off its exterior, with numerous slivers of bark mixed
in with the rotting mulch on the ground.  Thick branches jut out from the
sides of the tree, their leafy limbs stretching out among the heavens and
blocking out all available sunlight from above.
~
E
large branch blocking~
A four-foot diameter branch sticks out from the side of the tree at
approximately shoulder-level, its thick limb protruding through the
foliage of the other nearby trees and into darkness.  Much of its
underside bark has been stripped away by travelers not stooping low
enough to pass underneath without scraping some off.

A Dark, Foreboding Clearing~
Coming to a crossroads deep within the forest, two narrow paths of
trampled foliage converge within a dark clearing.  Running east to west,
one path seems to have born the brunt of frequent usage, widening
slightly to the west before disappearing into the trees beyond.  The
pathway that runs north to south is considerably more narrow, barely
squeezing between two gigantic oaks that flank the path.  The sound of
gurgling water can be heard to the north, trickling off into the distance.

Between Two Giant Oak Trees~
This narrow trail zigzags between two enormous old oak trees.  The path
here is not as trampled as the rest of the forest area, with many slender
saplings poking up through the dense undergrowth.  Scattered shards of
bark have been stripped from the tree, jutting out into the air.  Running
to the north and south, the passage makes for a tight squeeze yet a
convenient shortcut through the camp area.

Created from the constant foot traffic of kobolds rushing from one part

enormous old oak 4 trees~
Growing high above the natural canopy of the forest, these two massive
oak trees must be hundreds of years old for them to have grown to such a
height and breadth.  The raider presence in the area has taken its toll
on these trees, however.  Splinters jut out from the trees from the
constant traffic, and the tree to the west has an oddly-colored patch of
bark.
~

A large patch of bark on the tree is discolored slightly, turned a dull

A Small Clearing in the Forest~
Approached from the narrow southward path, this forest clearing is quite
tranquil.  Circular in shape, this natural meadow rises up slightly in
the middle, where a bubbling @espring@n has erupted from the ground.  A
slender cut in the earth draws the water away from the sparkling pool,
the burbling stream winding its way northward through the trees.  A
multitude of tracks surround a thin muddy strip around the pool, before
disappearing into the bushy crabgrasses at the bottom of the slope.

Sparkling clear water pours forth from a rough hole that leads deep into
the earth.  The miniature geyser gushes from the top of a low dirt mound,
rising above the small clearing.  Tiny bubbles of air float to the
surface, its light fizzing sound penetrating the otherwise ominous
silence of the dark forest.
~
E

Erosion from the bubbling spring has gouged a narrow cut in the lip of
the earth at the top of the small hill, allowing the spring to trickle

Slowly trickling to the north, this small stream of crystal-clear water

A thin strip of oozing mud lines the outside edge of the bubbling spring,
before meeting the rocks on the crest of the hill.  Numerous small animal
tracks, mostly belonging to birds, lay pressed in the mud, disappearing

bushy crabgrass~
Growing tall and lush, a ring of bushy crabgrass begins at the bottom of
the dirt mound and continues into the forest.  Fed from the moisture that

Beside a Great Oak Tree~
Here, deep within the forest, the trail slowly widens toward the west
where more and more foliage has been trampled underfoot.  Paralleling a
great oak to the south, the narrow track through the trees also leads off
to the east, where it narrows off into total darkness.  A slender sapling
stands intact in the middle of the path, refusing to yield to the forces
that crushed its neighbors.  Lying across the path are low stacks of
chopped logs, stored as firewood.

Inside a Worn Canvas Tent~
Pale, flickering light illuminates the interior of the worn canvas tent,
issuing from the middle of the shelter where a cluster of burning candles
has been stuck atop a flat grey stone.  The debris from the trees that
were cut down to make room for this tent has been cleared, and the ground
meticulously swept.  Shallow grooves have been gouged from the dirt
surrounding the centrally-placed rock, forming some sort of idyllic
symbol.

Outside a Fine Canvas Tent~
This section of the path through the forest is heavily trampled, with
dozens of footprints leading toward a large canvas tent that lies to the
west.  Unlike the other tents in the area, the canvas is of the finest
quality and has been thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed.  The edges of the
tent flaps have ornate designs integrated into the cloth, and thick,
sturdy poles hold the tent up high.  The well-trodden track continues to
both the north and south, and toward a great oak that lies to the
northeast.

Inside a Fine Canvas Tent~
The interior of the sprawling tent is quite spacious.  Tall wooden poles
reinforced with iron bands heave great amounts of canvas high into the
air, and the long walls of fibers are pulled taut.  Flickering light,
thrown by a fire burning in the center of the tent, dances through the
shadows, its smoke rising up through a ventilation hole overhead.  A
makeshift throne lies some distance from the other crudely built
furniture surrounding the campfire, placed for the kobold war council.  A
wide pot of soup boils next to the blaze, perhaps its the kobold leader's
next meal.

Massive amounts of wood must have been chopped down to make room for the

Outside a Shabby Canvas Tent~
Snaking through the dense trees, the narrow-cut path turns from north to
east around an immense oak tree.  A crudely chopped-down section of trees
have been cleared to the south where a grubby old tent has been erected,
just narrowly fitting between two tall trees.  Scores of tracks lead in
both directions along the path, as if there were something of importance
nearby.

The musty smell of moldy canvas and damp foliage permeates this grubby

A Dark, Foreboding Clearing~
Black as night under the thick canopy of leaves high above, this small
clearing boasts little undergrowth in its hardpack dirt, due to the lack

A Small Clearing in the Forest~
Cleared to make a sleeping space for the kobold raiders, this deforested
clearing is littered with sleeping mats and battle supplies.  Logs that

A Winding Path Next to a Great Oak Tree~
Barely visible through the dense forest, this narrow path winds its way
between a great oak and a stand of elms in a dark, heavy forest.  Slender
saplings have been trampled into the dirt by heavy traffic, with no
thought for the damage caused to the local fauna.  A tangle of roots,
exposed through the dry, crumbling dirt, makes travel difficult.  Broken
branches and ripped leaves mark the path's exits to the east and the west.

slender saplings trampled~
Young saplings saplings have been ground into the layer of crumbling dirt
and dried leaves on the ground.  The thick canopy of leaves high above
has caused this lee side ancient oak to receive little moisture, making
everything crisp and brittle.  Passersby have repeatedly crushed the
diminutive trees in order to create the narrow path that runs from the
east to the west through the forest.
~
E
tangle roots exposed~
A lack of water on the lee side of the great oak tree has caused the dry,
crumbling dirt to break up and turn into dust, exposing a twisted tangle
of roots on the ground.  Weaving their way in near-infinite directions in
an attempt to draw moisture into the tree, the mass makes travel
difficult along this portion of the path.

Almost invisible through the dark, murky forest, the pathway that runs

ripped into pieces, marking the passage.

Path Around a Great Oak Tree~
Twisting its way between a great oak and other smaller trees nearby, the
narrow path is shrouded in shadows, the dense forest canopy allowing only
the strongest light to filter down from above.  Along the forest floor,
the normally-lush foliage and just-emerging saplings have been ground
underfoot, whether by the normal fauna or unusually heavy traffic not
readily detected.  Angling off to the north and west, the narrow track
disappears deep into the forest.

[Rikahn] Will add weapon custom at a later time, want to devise some sort of quest weapon where parts are collected from all 3 of these clustered zones.

E
great oak tree~
Her bark cracked and covered with pale grey-green lichen, the oak stands
watch over this part of the forest, much as it has for countless years. 
Perhaps, she is the mother of the surrounding trees, having watched them
fall as acorns from her great boughs.  Her branches twist and tangle with
those of her offspring, both young and old, in the crowded canopy above,
hoarding what light might filter down to the flora below.
~
E
foliage saplings ground~
Tiny tree saplings have been ground into the layer of crumbling dirt and
dried leaves on the ground.  The thick canopy of leaves high above has
caused this lee side of the tree to receive little moisture, making
everything crisp and brittle.  Passersby have repeatedly crushed the
young trees in order to create the narrow path that runs west and north
through the forest.

Inside of a Great Oak Tree~
Crudely carved from the inside of the great oak, this chamber appears to
serves as a barrier between the forest and what lies below.  No light
seeps through the tightly sealed outer layer of wood and the bark hides
this chamber from the outside world.  A narrower chamber has been cut
deeper into the bottom of the tree, with a crude rope ladder leading down
into darkness.

chamber carved inside great oak tree~
Crudely hacked out of the inside of this great oak tree, the chamber is
large enough for a small band of travelers to fit into comfortably.  The
walls are very rough, and sap oozes from the still-fresh hack marks. 
Chunks and slivers of wood lie in piles against the sides of the tree,
leftover from the violent butchery of the living tree.

crude rope ladder~
A long stretch of rope has been knotted into a crude rope ladder, then
tied around a thick node of wood that was not hacked away when the

A Murky Pool Inside of a Great Oak Tree~
More narrow than the chamber above, this pit, carved from the heart of a
great oak, reeks with reeks with a melange of fetid and rank smells. 
Water and sap have collected at the bottom of the cavity, along with some
sort of mucus from the toadlike creature imprisoned here, creating a
foul, rank-looking mixture.  A crude rope ladder drapes down from above,
hanging just low enough to use for the climb to safety, but out of reach
of the creature.

Rainwater seeping into the pit from above has mixed with sap that oozed

everything.

Dangling down from above, a crude rope ladder made from single length of

an escape, it provides a welcome sight to those who have found this dank,
rank place.

A Path Through a Dense Forest~
A dense forest of trees forms a sort of natural tunnel; the trunks
creating the walls and the arching branches overhead the ceiling.  Wide
green leaves and broad branches combine to effectively hide the sky.

A Path Through a Dense Forest~
Wide-trunked trees line the path, their craggy park almost entirely
covered with shaggy dark-green moss.  Broad leaves sprout from branches
at every possible opportunity, creating a dense wall of foliage.  A thick
limb has fallen from one of the trees and lies blocking the path, its
slender offshoot branches poking up at the sky.

A Path Through a Dense Forest~
The path continues south and north, thick moss lines the base of the
trees throughout the area, perhaps a stream of some sorts is near by.  A
large branch has fallen to the south, blocking most of the path from
passage.  Any attempts to move east or west are pointless, as the trees
are packed too close for most forest animals to fit through.

A Path Through a Dense Forest~
The dense profusion of trees pulls back somewhat to the east, revealing a
wide river flowing through the woods.  Rushing across a riverbed cut deep
into the forest floor, the water and turns like a snake.  The forest
continues to grow to the south, unaffected by the river's path.  Heavy
moss covers the broad, rugged trunks of the trees, giving the illusion of
green walls.  An old log bridge, a brace of felled tree trunks lashed
together with weathered rope, spans the river to the east.

Log Bridge in Coralon Forest~
A small-scale excavation has occurred here in order to allow for the
foundations that support the log bridge that spans eastward over the
river.  Leading up to the bridge are four shallow steps, each about one
foot in height.  A half dozen tree trunks have been lashed together with
yard upon yard of weather worn rope.  Very little has been done to the
logs other than the stripping of the bark and the smearing of a tar and
sand slurry over each trunk.  At random intervals occasional gaps varying
in size from an inch or so to over a foot in width lie between the logs
making it easy to stumble or even fall on the uneven surface.

E
excavation foundations~
A series of deep holes and trenches have been hacked into the side of the
riverbank, and the foundations that support the bridge are, for the most
part, buried in the hard packed earth.  It looks as though some repairs
have been made in the past when parts of the foundation have become too
unstable to continue supporting the heavy log bridge.
~
E
shallow steps~
These appear to be the off cuts from the trunks that have been used to
create the surrounding foundations of the bridge.  Most appear to be
roughly hewn and sit at badly skewed angles, wobbling unsteadily when any
weight is placed upon them.
~
E
tree trunks logs tar sand slurry~
Each trunk is around a foot in diameter and long enough to span the
entire width of the river without a break.  Their bark has been stripped
back in an effort to smooth their surfaces slightly before being coated
in a viscous concoction of sand and tar that has been used to keep the
majority of the weather from the hard wood.
~
E
weather worn rope~
Weaving over and under the logs, this durable rope tightly secures the
logs together, forming the wide bridge that spans the river.  Here and
there strands of twine uncurl from the twisted length of rope - a sign of
its slow degradation from time and weathering.
