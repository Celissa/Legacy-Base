Judgement Gate - Dun Tathaig~
The towering gates of Dun Tathaig rise over thirty feet in height and
twice that across.  Heavy wooden beams have been bound with a latice of
spiked steel, their tips gleaming in the torch light.  Encircling the
massive city is the great wall, its stones hewn by the dwarves of old
before their decline reach well over two hundred feet in height. 
Reinforced with elvish and humanic magics the fortifications have stood
against many foes without breach.  Watch towers rise from the walls top,
roadways connecting each of the towers.  Fluttering from countless flag
poles are blue flags adorned with twin headed ravens, the symbol of the
free peaople of Dun.
~
[Eliza] if you're going to have gates that are able to be swung, they would be iron-banded wood and a more thin metal portcullis. The iron-banded wood gates would be locked together by a fairly traditional sliding beam.

Gallows Road - Dun Tathaig~
Gallows road cuts through the massive wall on its journey through Dun
Tathaig, its surface cobbled but well worn with the eons of merchant
traffic.  A stout door has been set into the walls side the east, its
surface flush with the stone.  Southwards the road climbs slightly as it
heads deeper into the city, the famed gallows that give the road its name
just visible from here.  Crows swirl through the narrow alleys that form
between the multi-storied shops and houses that form the bulk of the
cities buildings.

Gallows Road - Dun Tathaig~
Nestled against the towering walls lie the rough cast houses of poor and
lowly merchants.  The jumble of wood and stone lean in a haphazard
fashion that lends both to quick collaps and fire hazard.  Weaving
through the miriad of houses runs the gallows road, its journey taking it
from the northern wall towards the merchant quarters.  Crows and rooks
line the out-hanging gables and tower tops their harsh cries calling for
more to join the gallows.

Thieves' Market~
Wide in comparison to the narrow streets of the Labyrinth, the market
square is a bustle of activity...traders selling their wares with prices
and quality geared towards the "practical" residents of the city's
poorest district.  Hard-packed dirt surrounds the muddy trenches of wagon
ruts, encircling the market's center to the northwest.  Along the uneven
southern row of houses and petty shops, one in particular proudly displays
all of its glass windows intact.

[Usiel] Aglow with flickering torches, lanterns and rows of soft candles, the street to the north is bathed in a low, inviting red.

The worn and mud-drowned cobbles here are haplessly strewn with hay, from
a small and relatively unkempt @ystable@n to the east.  The doors are
wide and the beam slide used as a locking mechanism is formidably thick,
as is prudent for businesses in the Labyrinth.  The windows of the nearby
houses seem rarely used, not surprising due to the wretched stench of
quartered steeds.

Carras Way~
Even amidst the subtly exotic display of culture, the feel of shadowed
monotony is ever present, a feel that only adds to danger of the
Labyrinth's streets.  Carras Way bends gently to the west and south,
beneath dangling ropes and tightly shut windows.  The scent of burning
wood and poorly handled trash hangs like a haze over the narrow homes of
the city's less prosperous.

The houses rise close together here in this old part of the city; the
upper floors, merely a few feet apart, cast deep shadows along the roads. 
Some paned and others boarded over with ancient scraps of weathered wood,
the windows remain shut tight, locked and barred in all seasons of the
year.  Stretching across the road from house to house, ropes have been
affixed to the sills and sport a variety of laundry of all shapes, sizes
and states of repair.

Carras Way~
Worn and weathered cobbles peek through the dirt of the winding street,
bathed in the sweet smoky mist of ovens and firepits.  The buildings
crowding the southern side of the road boast colorful awnings, stretching
out from the front, held aloft by simple wooden pikes - a jarring note
among the otherwise stoic structures.  Further to the east, the street
narrows slightly, the colors growing darker and more drab, while
northward, the houses seem to sprawl out in muted, sandy-hued tones.  The
road bends to follow the slope of the city wall, anchored by a large and
well-tended house at the southwest corner...walls weathered but still
warm with the color of red sandstone.

Lengths of canvas cloth, the sort used for tent making, seem to have been
ripped from larger bolts of the same material.  The colors, although
still bright, are fading gradually to muted shades more in tune with the
tenor of the street.  Frayed edges and worn patches in the fabric
indicate the awnings were placed here long ago, supported on stout wooden
pikes jabbed securely into the ground.

Perhaps a patron of the local community, or a remnant of a more glorious

Carras Way~
Wooden shutters carved in imaginative and ornate designs cover the
windows of these otherwise meager two-story houses.  Oiled wooden
shingles provide gently sloping roofs, supported at the eaves by beams of
sturdy timber reaching out just far enough to protect from the driving
coastal rains.  Several boxes block the alley to the northeast, which
ends at a grand, circular turret of the city wall.

The houses have a distinctive style, most likely suited to a warm and dry
climate but adapted for the temperate and sometimes-rainy weather of the
western coast.  At times it seems as though the windows were designed to
provide the best angle for archers, a reminder that the borders of the
Duke's influence were not always so far away.
~
E
wall~
Constructed of vast blocks of chiseled grey stone, the wall stands
anywhere from thirteen to fifteen yards high and approximately two yards
thick, with rectangular-shaped buttresses spaced at regular distances to
strengthen it.  Circular guard towers appear at forty-foot intervals, a
wooden catwalk linking them all together.  Still solid and strong, the
ancient fortification remains in good condition, with only a few patches
of lighter stone marking areas of repair.

The hint of gaudy colors, now faded with time and weather, add to the
exotic design of the houses that line the city's northernmost street.  A
combination of wood, clay and other elements produce a wide variety of
structures, sprawling low to the south or rising up against the looming
wall to the north.  Wafting out upon the otherwise unpleasant wind are
the odors of active kitchens, a reminder of the ancient diversity of

The city wall is strong and broad, as grand in design and appearance as
it is in defense...at least it was the last time it was tested by

Labyrinth as often as they do out at the grasslands.

The houses come in all shapes and sizes, from tall and narrow ones to

brilliant colors that adorned the buildings at the time of their creation.

A shallow murky puddle dominates the center of this spiritless street,
reflecting the cast shadows of its surroundings.  Old and tired, humble
houses huddle against the solidity of the grey stone wall, standing tall

The houses here beneath the city wall remain inhabited, yet the trials of

Brilliantly colored trims and doors have faded to softer, more muted hues

moss.  Thatched roofs and shake-shingled ones alike, show signs of wear

Shadow-shrouded even at the height of day, a narrow alleyway sneaks
between two rows of ramshackle buildings, seeking to hide its existence
from the world.  Further constricting the cramped passage, a healthy
scattering of boxes and crates huddle against the back wall of the
structure to the west, very few of them left intact.  The darkness is
nearly complete here, the only light the wan glow of a candle seeping
through gaps in a boarded up window lying eastward.

Honest Lago's Lock and Key~
Confining and close, the meager little shop boasts no ornate shelving, no
rows or neat stacks of viable goods.  Instead, cheaply made crates and
boxes hold an odd assortment of wires and a selection of two or three
different types of simple locks and keys.  A single candle affords the
only light in the room, its wan, flickering flame doing little to
illuminate the shadowy corner where the shopkeeper remains most of the
time.  On the western wall, a boarded up window flanks a rickety wooden
door, leading out to a narrow alleyway.

Several rickety crates, stacked together, create a makeshift counter at
the mid-point of the shop.  Aligned in rows, a variety of simple locks

thread-like wires of different lengths.  Several other of the flimsy
boxes line the back wall of the room, tossed there in haphazard piles.

A fat, irregularly shaped tallow candle perches atop a counter-like
affair, a series of crates stacked two high and two wide.  Melted wax pools
at the base of the half-burnt taper, its dull flame creating a circle of
pale light in the center of the meager shop, leaving the corners veiled
in shadows.

A poorly framed opening flanks the shop's door, its oil-parchment

road.  Paving stones, dim reminders of a forgotten past, are cracked and
broken, the way itself twisted and tortuous, only generally moving to the
west and east across the city.  Dilapidated buildings cram their way onto
the strange bends, displaying a lack of care with their construction, the
beaten-down houses interspersed with ragged shops...dark establishments
with little to offer.  The atmosphere is heavy with an air of
hopelessness, broken people matching the broken streets.

Kergan's Run~
Little more than a twisted and craggy ruined street winding a path around
ramshackle buildings, Kergan's Way follows a torturous journey through
the city.  Dark, frowning structures force their way into the bends of
the road, unoiled portals often creaking open to eject dim rag-garbed
creatures, all hurrying on their way as if anxious to be done and safe
behind warped doors again.  Here and there, a crumbling stone wall
reveals itself, small segments of a larger wall rendered unusable by time. 
The broken shapes slowly melt into aging constructions, even the most
recent tottering and sagging under the weight of years.  Oppression
hovers in the air like an ancient, dusty shroud.

Kergan's Run~
A row of dismal houses borders the southern side of this straight stretch
of Kergan's Way.  Ancient beyond reckoning, warped boards form the grey
and weathered walls of these pitiful dwelling places, and what roofs
remain intact are hole-filled, offering little protection from the
climate.  Only a few random buildings lie on the road's northern edge, as
if people are shunning the tree-covered rise of Kergan's Hill and the
abandoned abbey roosting at the crest.

Kergan's Run~
A grim, winding street weaves a sparsely populated pathway through the
Labyrinth, a palpable hush underscoring the postures of oppression
present in the stance of the locals.  Open spaces in the pitiful clumps
of people reveal a craggy, untended roadbed, piles of muck and trash
heaped up against the shadowed walls of depressed shanties.  The
structures bordering the twisting way are as drab as their surroundings,
only the occasional shop boasting a faded and beaten sign suspended above
a sagging door.  In the distance to the north, emerging above the huddled
roofs, a tall hill makes its presence felt.  Known nowadays simply as
'Kergan's Hill', it's the site of the ruin of an abandoned abbey
dedicated to some long-forgotten god.

At the Foot of Kergan's Hill~
The twists and turns of Kergan's Way finally meet their end here at the
base of a rising hill, almost out of place among the ramshackle tenements
and decaying walls, remnants of a forgotten past.  A trail of sorts
wanders up the slope of the mound, an oft untraveled path leading to the
crest and the ruined archway looming there.  The hill itself rises above
the roofs of the Labyrinth, a grass and tree covered monument to some
forgotten god.  A few fickle buildings cling to the sides of the roadway
here, and odd brickwork ruins give a backdrop to the dismal structures, a
line that disappears into the distance to the west and east.

River Road merges into Bucklebrass Lane, delving into the depths of the
city between tightly packed rows of dreary buildings.  Some of the worn
out structures serve as homes for the poverty-plagued masses; the larger,
two-storied ones confiscated and gutted for use as stopgap warehouses. 
The roadbed itself shows signs of wear, the old cobblestones cracked and
broken, but mostly still in place.

Bucklebrass Junction~
The rutted dirt road bends south along a crumbling stone wall, parallel
to the river, winding east among the most beggarly of dwellings. 
Shanties, lean-tos, even tents make up the majority of the homes,
although here and there the wreck of a ruined cottage can be seen,
setting a good way off the eroded path.  The River Duil flows languidly
to the west, its banks low and muddy at this point in its course.  Far in
the distance, the city wall and the northern river towers loom stark
against the horizon.

A string of one-room cottages, all in a dreary state of repair, line the
landward edge of the road that devolves from worn cobbles in the south
into hard-packed rutted dirt where it continues northward.  Opposite the
row of dismal houses, a grey-brick wall stands above the sharp rocks
along the bank of the River Duil.  An old and unnecessary fortification
since the construction of the grim grey towers on the jetty several yards
out, the wall is in desperate need of repair, its crumbling stonework
leaving large gaps in the span.  One structure, slightly larger than the
rest and in somewhat better repair, boasts a sign above the door.

The rock-strewn rutted road extends to the west, littered by cramped and
shuttered houses and shanties on either side.  There is little vegetation
here, only tired-looking trees and scattered patches of ragged grass
growing in the stone-hard soil.  The poverty in this small section of the
city is almost palpable, coloring everything within sight.  The
occasional sound of shouts or laughter rings out above the constant
lapping of the river's languid waters against the shore.

The Bottoms~
The ground falls sharply before leveling out along the bank, the
resultant backdrop of loose dirt providing shelter of sorts for the
dismal place the poorest of the poor call home.  Between here and the
Duil, a flat shelf of land holds tents, crates and half-built shanties, a
central campfire providing the only comfort from the dank air of the
nearby river.  Pools of dark water fill the low places in the soft soil,
deposited there by the surging river at high tide.  Off in the distance,
the gray stone walls of a broad tower rise against the horizon.

A variety of makeshift tents, weathered crates and shoddily constructed
shanties encircle a low-burning campfire, the only warmth in the
otherwise dank air so close to the Duil.  The tents, some made of old
blankets supported by sticks, others actual tarpaulins with sturdy,
straight poles, perch directly on the damp soil of the river bank,
providing a chilly bed.  The crates, upright in the daytime, are
overturned at night to create meager protection for sleeping.  Gathered
wood, both cut timbers and untrimmed branches, fashion the paper-roofed
walls of the shanties...the best of these dismal dwellings, yet still
scant refuge from the weather.

Although at first appearances the shop seems somewhat larger than the
other nearby structures, it is still quite cramped and confining, the
mustiness overshadowed by the scent of new-tanned leather and old sweat. 
Everywhere there are signs of the leatherworker's trade...awls,
heavy-bladed knives, long sharp needles whose eyes are threaded through
with rawhide thongs for piecing the items together.  Low but wide
shelving covers two of the weathered walls, their shelves filled with
stacks of all sorts of leather goods, from drinking skins to armor.  A
nearly illegible sign has been pegged to one wall close to the squeaking
door.

The grey stone wall follows the line of the river, falling into ruin now
that other means of defense provide protection to the city.  Underfoot,
the roadbed is hard-packed, with a number of the cobblestones still in

Allegro's~
Mullioned windows and a blue-stained door create an airy lightness within
the interior of the small cramped shop, filled from ceiling to floor with
tall oak shelves.  Stacked with all the smaller items important to the
musicians' profession, the cases give way to racks and stands holding a
wide variety of the goods offered in Allegro's - all manner of musical
instruments - those plucked or strummed, blown upon or beaten.  Burnished
hardwood floors, pristinely clean, reflect back creamy colored walls,
neither with a trace of dust or dirt on them.  Stuck to a hook on the
wall, a piece of yellowed parchment serves as a @esign@n.

Dwarrow Commons~

~
[Usiel] Linear and particularly tidy, this expansive junction is lined with tightly-laid pale greystone blocks and flattened cobbles. Houses sit low and sturdy, some with high foundations of stone brick, others bearing walls of exquisitely-crafted monolithic slabs, cut to perfection.
[Usiel] Stairs descend into alleys and doorways, as though the street were merely the covering for labyrinthine caves. Sprouting from the fields of stone is a small, circular well.

[Eliza] apothecary is usually somewhere that you buy medicines.
[Eliza] Would it be cool to have a few rechargeable wands/staves?

~
[Usiel] Clustering together like the fingers of Tytan's Reach, the houses
that straddle this stretch of Grommet Street are low and wide at the base,
wood upon stacked and reinforced stone foundations.
[Usiel] Deceptive in their proximity, the sunken doors and blocked alleys hint at large basement dwellings, as though the earth had reached up and pulled them down into the soil.
[Usiel] A side street winds off to the west, narrow and dark.

[Usiel] The University to the west is a magnificent structure of reaching spires, straight and often spiraling. Some say it was created in mimicry of Sorceror's Isle. A statue to the west, amidst the grassy and stone paths, of Rombard, the first Ducal Minister of Preservation... who commissioned the university
and Library late in the first century AC.
[Usiel] East is houses and petty shops.
[Usiel] Carillon street continues north and south. South is the giant bell tower.

Carillon Street~

[Usiel] 612
[Eliza] Academicium
[Usiel] The street continues north to south.
[Usiel] Well-placed cobbles form the street bed, though carriages are infrequent, as are horses. Small two or one-story houses and shops line the eastern row, while the university sprawls along the west. The outer wall allows a gated entrance to a grassy garden
Rbug [Usiel] in which scholars roam to think and speak in nature's fresh air.
[Usiel] Clock tower high above, far south.

[Eliza] Academicium
[Usiel] The corner of the university's walls forms a natural bend in the grassy garden path. Stone benches rest at intervals, and a small wooden platform rests prior to the wall, just to the west.
A little funny coded thing, where one can practice oration. Those who perform poorly will be pelted by onlookers, even those at the windows above, with small fruit. If we get around to it.

Tower Plaza~
Under Construction.
~
[Usiel] 647 and 652
[Usiel] The square is spacious and angular, with several monuments to thought and the written tradition. Clerks with bundles of parchment trudge back and forth, along
[Usiel] Carillon Street to the north, and the Lumistrada to the east. To the south, the looming doors to the city's grand bell tower, which towers above some 80 feet.
[Eliza] Academicium
[Usiel] Constructed from sparkling granite, the streets of the Lumistrada glitter from the light of the (sun/streetlamps). To the south, the Great Library of Dun Tathaig rises like a cathedral, buttressed between high and finely-crafted windows. Lions guard the den of knowledge, positioned around the mid-height
[Usiel] To the north, Several houses line the street... some with small supply shops below and rooming above for the students and academics that abound.
[Usiel] At intervals along the street are large and grandoise streetlamps, with glittering brass to reflect the light of their oil-pot candles.
[Usiel] The center of the road, for carriages, is cobbles... the sides are slabs or granite, polished smooth for walking.

the granite walk to the iron-banded oak doors. To the north, houses for lodging. The Lumistrada runs east to west, cobble in the middle, glittering granite slabs to the sides. The lamps.
[Usiel] The library looms to the south, lions and all that. TO the north, an iron fence with lovely designs, covered with vines, protects an open field behind the houses that follow the street. A path cuts in
to the north, just to the east. The cobbles in the middle, the granite slabs on the sides,

[Eliza] South Gate
[Usiel] Adorned with smoothstone carvings in what was once a ritual for apprentice craftsman, the city's South Gate is an otherwise simple affair. Anchored by four large pillars, a pair within and without, the archway consists of a simple portcullis and iron-banded doors.
[Usiel] A small staircase leads up to the east, to the great wall's parapet; at its base, the doorway to the gatehouse and borough watch, adorned with a friendly wreath.

[Usiel] For cart alone the street here remains flatly cobbled, lined on either side by spacious, but not extravagant, houses and gardens. Intricately twining patterns of white wood form a delicate archway to the east, clothed in snaking vines and several budding flowers.
[Usiel] Like a path through the forest, the eastern street twists away among the trees that veil the not-so-distant city wall.

Vayra Lane~
Under Construction.
~
[Usiel] Their roots sheltered beneath a flutter of bushes, two thin Ksaia
trees twine together at their branches to the west, expertly groomed by a race as
skilled with living wood as others are at crafting it in death. 
Accompanying this beautiful archway is a vanguard of drooping trees, 
[Usiel] creating the illusion to those looking in that this quiet corner of the city is as deep as the forest's heart.
[Usiel] Nestled among the trees to the north is a simple house, built by hand but styled almost imperceptibly as though to look like it were carved from an enormous tree stump. Several skins are draped from a wooden beam at the edge of a small balcony, just high enough to be out of reach for even the tallest of thieves

Vayra Lane~
Under Construction.
~
[Usiel] The lane bends to the north and west, dirt almost free of wheel ruts and the signs of horses. Southward, clumps of trees litter the grassy fields, growing thicker at the edges of the city wall. Remnants of earlier years are nearly swallowed by bush and weed,
[Usiel] target stands and broken lancing slings resting undisturbed, a reminder of the city's largest expansion when the Duke's soldiers once trained upon these sloping greens.
[Usiel] Houses of sturdy, angling wood are relatively clustered at the bend, as compared to the overall sparity of the lane. A large front face and universal sign to the east mark the entrance to a shop, the glitter of assorted goods flashing in the wide, shutter-framed window.

Vayra Lane~
Under Construction.
~
[Usiel] Serene and placid, Vayra Lane has forgotten the bustle of one of the continent's largest cities, hearing only the occasional ring of a distant forge. Several paths branch off and around the pockets of trees, houses rejecting the formula of straight lines.
[Usiel] At its eastern edge, under the shade of looming and gnarled oak, a rock stack bubbles with cool, clear water. With no stream, no sloping aqueducts in sight, the source of the water is somehow less important than its obvious purity.
[Usiel] Fountain here.
A large front face and universal sign to the east mark the entrance to a shop, the glitter of assorted goods flashing in the wide, shutter-framed window.

~
[Usiel] As the lane bends to the west and south, the crest of a wall tower is barely visible beyond the trees. Several rows of bushes line winding paths, meticulously groomed. Unusually straight and logical, the large house to the east is also strangely built...
[Usiel] as though the architecture began down one ingenius route and abruptly jumped to another. Tinted windows are set low to the ground, and a doorway is barely visible at the end of a slanting path.

Grommet Street~
Under Construction.
~
[Usiel] The farthest tendrils of worn and sunken cobbles encroach from the bending road to the east, while northward the more narrow street descends into a linear garden of squat structures. Wooden houses here are often rounded, whether by design or afterthought, as though definitive corners were never a serious considera
[Usiel] consideration. A simple shop, one of few to rise above one story, quietly bears the swinging sign of a threaded needle... made more impressive by the vibrant colors of the curtains that adorn all three front windows.
[Usiel] Through the alley to the south, between thatched rooves, the crest of the temple rises majestically at a modest distance above the greystone wall that protects its grounds.
[Usiel] Extra for the temple: The sloping sides of the roof meet at an angle and are absorbed by the central square of the temple. Rising almost as a beacon of enlightenment, a rounded spire offers several windows and a walkway high above the city. The stone varies in color, from pale and glittering white to
[Usiel] the dull black of the statues of arched creatures that defend their perch.

Ranulf's Quality Weapons - Trade Isle~
Within the darkened interior of the tent, the gloom broken only by
pin-holes of light seeping through flawed canvas walls, an array of
swords lie side-by-side on the heavy table that serves as a counter.  To
either end of that same table, a variety of smaller knives - daggers and
dirks - stand upright, buried nearly to the hilt in the dark-grained wood. 
Leaning against a weapons rack at the back are spears and polearms of
different lengths and weights, and suspended overhead, a strip of rawhide
strung across the tent holds an assortment of sheathes and scabbards.

Supported at either end by a pair of crudely formed crates, the table has

of the hand-thick plank is dark, the wood burnished and rich with the
patina of age.  Scars and gouges mar the surface of the makeshift
counter, where half a score of daggers and dirks have been buried upright
to the hilt.

Before the Ruins of South Keep~
The hint of ancient road, winding between the sparsely grown trees, ends
at rock-strewn field of half-dead weeds and grass sprinkled with a
smattering of bright-hued flowers.  Clearly seen to the east and west,
the torpid waters of River Duil roll sluggishly by on a journey to the
sea.  Rising starkly up from the far southern spit of land, a jumble of
broken stone and destroyed walls mark what was once South Keep, ancestral
home of a long-extinct clan.

Well-Worn Path Among the Trees~
The path is barely wide enough for one, its course winding between
close-growing trees until it opens out into a spacious clearing. 
Underfoot, the trail is cushioned by the years' accumulation of fallen
leaves, dropped by the deciduous oaks that flourish here at the southern
end of the island.  Sparse patches of grass and arching, lacy-leafed
ferns draw life from the somewhat rocky soil; beneath their shaded fronds
a handful of dew-coated daisies struggle to grow.

Heart of the Camp~
Between the road dubbed Duke's Crossing and the grim ruins of South Keep
lies a standing gypsy camp, semi-permanent home to the Wandering Folk, a
tribe of dark-haired, dark-eyed beauties and swarthy, well- built men
clad in the colorfully embroidered clothing customarily worn by these
people.  Less than a score of wagons, some on blocks and some still
wheeled, form the perimeter of a vast circle; brightly painted wooden and
canvas-covered wagons drawn by the elegant horses of the golden plains. 
Dominating the center of the open area, a large campfire burns day and
night, creating a communal gathering place for the Folk - a shared place
for life and love and song.

Blue and Green Wagon - Trade Isle~
Not far from the fire, a solid wood wagon rests atop fire hardened
blocks, a permanent part of the settlement.  Stained and decorated in
random patterns of blue and vibrant green, the trim is brilliant yellow
the color of the sun.  The surrounding area is well-tended, the grass
cropped short by the grazing mare and few possessions stacked neatly on
the wagon's seat.  A stand of old oaks edges the clearing to the south,
circling around to the east where the ruins of an crumbling wall peek
between the trees.

Gypsy Camp - Trade Isle~
A pair of box-shaped wagons nestle among the trees, one with a sigil of
warding scribed upon its flimsy door, the other portal hung with a beaded
and belled curtain.  From behind the draped closure, odd aromas drift
outward, a pungent but tangy melange of sweet and spicy scents.  An
enormous yellow dog lazes beneath a wagon, his head resting between two
massive paws.  Underfoot, a thick stand of grass grows up to the base of
a crumbling wall, where a gap in the ancient ruins offers a open way to
the water.

Down at the River's Edge - Trade Isle~
Running nearly to the river's edge, the stand of trees gives way to a
strip of rocky ground, sloping downward slightly to the slow-surging
river.  Some of the stones forming the shore have been disturbed, pushed
aside to clear a path to the water, where the gypsies lead their horses
to drink.  The Duil is crystal clear here and wide, its only color
derived from that which reflects within it.  Far across the water toward
the east, the buildings of Dun Tathaig rise proud against the horizon,
their outlines blurred and dimmed by distance.

Gypsy Camp - Trade Isle~
The largest of the gypsy conveyances rests here, the canvas fabric
covering it stained a berry-bright red, and a belled curtain conceals the
interior.  Still wheeled, a line of horses is tethered to a rough hempen
rope, stretching from a crude hook affixed to the wagon's bed to tie
around strong, thick branch.  Visible through the trees, the sparkling
water of the Duil flows slowly toward the sea, its sluggish waves
lapping at the rocky shore.  Vestiges of a once-great wall lie eastward,
the gray stone tumbled to the ground in disarray.

Gypsy Camp - Trade Isle~
The trees grow close together, shading this northern side of the clearing. 
Here, there are three smaller-sized wagons, all on fire-hardened blocks,
forming the permanent part of the camp.  The sights and sounds of
life...newly washed clothes hanging from a branch, the quiet
concentration of two men bent over some sort of dice game...prevail in
this out of the way area at the back of the campsite.  One of the wagons
has faded in color, as though untended in recent times.

Lazar's Thrift Shoppe~
Dust motes dance in the light of sunbeams streaming through the opened
doorway of this cluttered shop.  Musty air assaults the nose as eyes
adjust to take in the darkened corners, where cobwebs attach themselves
to the various goods stacked there.  A small swept spot in the center of
the hardwood floor indicates that the shopkeeper has made some small
attempt at cleaning, but dust still shows thick most places, including
the counter of age-darkened wood.  A wizened stooped old man, perhaps
Lazar, peers at you, asking in a gravelly voice, "Buying or selling
today?" and with a wave of his hand he indicates the used wares he's
selling...from clothing to tents, weapons to lutes, lanterns to dog-eared
books.

MacArdell's House of Banking~
A tasteful office, decorated in subdued shades of gray, occupies the
front room of MacArdell's House of Banking.  Just inside the door an oak
railing runs the length of the room, separating a waiting area from the
desks of clerk, busily scratching away in voluminous ledgers.  Tall, but
narrow windows provide some light on sunny days, while lamps resting atop
the desks give light in cloudy weather or near dusk.  Off to the left, an
oak door leads into the private office of the financier, head of the
establishment, and at the back of the room, an iron door, securely
locked, leads into a vault.

Cellar - Black Padre's~
The stairwell descends into the damp gloom of the cellar beneath Black
Padre's.  In the dim light, casks of ale and racks of wine, festooned
with cobwebs, stand against hard-packed earthen walls.  Likewise, the
floor here is of hard-packed earth, muddied in one corner where some
hidden water source makes its way through the grate, set high in one dark
corner, to trickle slowly down the wall.  A closer look reveals the signs
of vermin...a hole chewed in a grain sack...gnawed wood on the corner of
a crate...a wheel of cheese with the distinct markings of rat teeth.  The
air is musty with the same sweet, cloying scent that permeates the
tavern, adding to an inherent sense of danger

Carras Way~
In relative seclusion, the old and quiet street comes to an end at the
foot of a gentle and weed-strewn incline.  The high and imposing city
wall extends to the east and west, a majestic backdrop to the
unremarkable dwellings that line Carras Way.  At the very terminal of the
road, simple and unadorned, a home formed of wood and rich river clay
rests beneath the rough green rise of Kergan's Hill, spanning the gap
that might have extended the street ages ago.

home wood clay~
A sprawling house constructed of sun-dried bricks and aged wood rises to
the west, effectively blocking the continuance of Carras Way.  Old beyond
reckoning, the sturdy structure shows few traces of its original vibrant
colors, the red of the clay fading to tawny rose, the weathered timbering
now muted gray.  A pair of windows flanks the unpainted front door, many
of their thick-glassed panes cracked or broken.  The yard surrounding the
building is untended, overgrown with weeds and scattered stands of grass
gone to seed.

The soft and diluted glow of candlelight reflects against the quartered
windows, illuminating the shop with the help of the crackling fire
burning in the hearth.  Long oak tables divide the quaint shop and
shelves line the walls, cluttered with oddities of various sizes and
shapes.  A series of pipes, levers and small chains runs haphazardly
along the wood-beam ceiling, congregating at the wall beside the front
door.  A shining flower of radiant purple sways lazily in the mild
breeze, flowing gently from the open funnel, descending from a web of
dull copper above.  Along the northern wall, an antique wooden desk and
countertop draw the attention of the room, a large oil lamp glowing
softly even in the day, casting a yellow hue to the bundles of scrolls
and parchments that rest atop it.  To one side, a small workbench holds a
few metal tools and a thin film of sawdust.

shelves oddities~
Tall oak shelves cover the walls from ceiling to floor, cluttered with a
series of oddities...all manner of switches, gears and levers, and even a
smattering of toys' body parts...arranged it seems, more to suit the
owner's fancy than to draw the customer's eye.

desk oil lamp scrolls parchments~
This large oak desk provides the counter necessary for all good shops,
though it's quite evident the space is used as much for thought and
design as for the transfer of money.  Large scrolls of various colors sit
in piles, some bound with string, others lying open to reveal exquisite
sketches of models that elude the common understanding.  A large oil lamp
hangs from a peg behind the counter, casting a blanket of warm, yellow
light upon the entire area.  Among the scattered papers, tools, and tiny
items of display, two books show evidence of recent use.  One, a simple,
string-bound journal, contains some of the recent contracts, creations
and transactions of the shop's owner...though the writing is almost
indecipherable.  The other, a hard bound volume with a sizable number of
pages, is titled: "Politics, the Mechanical Nature of Society." Atop the
desk sits a small, black box, and on it...a button.  A small note pinned
to the wood reads: "@eRing Me@n."

pipes levers chains ceiling wall~
Behind the front door, spread upon the wall like metal vines, is a
contraption of intricate beauty.  A gleaming cube with small, depressible
buttons rests upon a cylindrical axle, a host of complimentary and
inverted levers interpreting the press of a key, and reacting with dozens
of movements.  To the side, further down the axle, a similar host awaits
silently, with a series of weighted bars to guide the intended shift's
descent.  A few of the levers and gears extend to a small box above the
door, and disappear into the frame.  There seems to be some sort of code
within the design of this creation, but it remains buried far within the
mesh structure.

flower purple copper funnel~
Within this sea of intriguing sculpture, an occasional movement catches
the eye...the squeaking rotation of a large gear, the swing of a
pendulum...the turning of a doll's eyes to follow your passing, it's
impish smile almost too real to be mimicry.

Nevyn's Stables~
The interior of the structure, as well as the exterior, are long past
their prime, the wood of the walls and stalls dry and weathered with age
and lack of attention.  A narrow aisle, separating two rows of cramped
stalls, is nothing more than hard-packed, straw-strewn dirt.  Against the
back wall of the room, a half dozen grain sacks and a moderate-sized
mound of hay lay side by side, a rusty pitchfork jabbed upright in dirt
beside them.  The resident beasts of the shelter are less than quality
animals, most of them showing at least one noticeable conformation defect.

stalls rows cramped~
Two rows of narrow stalls line the walls of the stable on either side of
hard dirt aisle.  The enclosures are cramped, just wide enough to hold a
full size horse, a feed bin and a half-rusted water bucket full of murky,
day old water.  Strewn across the floor of each, several forkfuls of hay
have been scattered, giving off a musty scent as if in need of changing.
~
E
hay grain sacks mound~
Set against the back wall of the stable, a dozen burlap sacks filled with
grain and a low mound of hay rest alongside each other.  One of the sacks
lies on its side, grain spilling from a hole near the top.  The hay emits
a musty scent, as if old or damp.
~
E
pitchfork~
The pitchfork, buried halfway up tines in the earthen stable floor, has a
simple wooden handle worn smooth with use and stained with sweat and dirt. 
The fork portion of the implement shows signs of rust, save for the tines
which have been filed free of corrosion and tapered to a sharp point.
