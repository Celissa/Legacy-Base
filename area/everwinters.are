Stairway to the Basin Land~
A narrow ledge juts out from the slick shale cliffs.  A crumbling flight
of broken stairs spiral rapidly downward from the shelf.  Far below, a
rock-covered basin stretches outward; a raging waterfall tumbling down
from the other side creates a fast flowing river that cuts through the
middle of the valley.  Growing beside the river, a smattering of pine
trees creates light woodlands.  Northward, the Everwinter Mountains rise,
their majestic peaks capped in gleaming ice.  Dark, brooding clouds hang
around the snowline, the dull rumbles of thunder echoing though the range. 
Beyond a scattering of weatherworn boulders, a goat track winds eastward,
its destination obscured by the steeply rising mountain range.

Hacked from the pitted cliff face, the ancient steps allow a hardy soul
access to the basin land below.  Marred by landslide and eroded by the
harsh elements, they are begining to fall into ruin.
~
E
basin valley~
A verdant forest of towering firs spread outward from the base of the
Everwinters, a scattering of boulders and lesser outcroppings keeping the
woodlands company.  The silvery-blue hue of the mountain river cuts
through the greys and greens like the curl of a young girl's ribbon.
~
E
Everwinter Mountains~
As their name suggests, the massive peaks seem to be in the grip of a icy
winter.  Gleaming caps of snow and ice sparkle like the spears of an
army; what lies beyond the peaks is hidden from here.  Thunder clouds
hang heavy over their magestic crowns, the rumble almost a constant
companion to those in the range.
~
E
river~
A fast-flowing mountain river, formed at the base of the tumbling
waterfall, flows swiftly through the countryside, its churning waters
cutting a deep gorge through the rocky valley as they rush westward.

Stairwell Along the Icy Cliff~
Hacked into the frost-covered stones of the cliff, the narrow flight of
stairs zigzags downward toward the valley floor.  The top of a mighty
pine tree reaches to the edge of the stairwell, a bold soul might be able
to jump to its dense branches if brave or foolish enough.  Flaking rocks
and crumbling stones rain down upon the stairs, making for an unpleasant
journey.  Spreading out around fifty feet below the basin is a mixture of
pine trees and tussock plants scattered between rubble.  Across the
valley a waterfall tumbles from a mountain lake, a few ruined buildings
spreading out around it.

pine tree~
The ancient pine, gnarled with age and battered by the inclement clime,
grows to over eighty feet in height from base to uppermost branches.  The
top, a clustering of willowy limbs bedecked with blue-green needles,
rises to just above the cliff ledge.  Its possible the old tree might be
climbable down to the road below, if only a sturdier set of branches can
be found, but apparently the only way to reach them would be by
jumping...and its a long way down...

Stairwell - Edge of the Valley~
A narrow flight of stairs zigzags up the side of the hundred foot
grey-stone cliff, their destination obscured by jutting rocks.  A massive
pine tree stands tall beside the stairs, a mound of pine needles
spreading under its gnarled roots.  A badly eroded road winds southward,
the cobbles broken and cracked.  Tussock and daises grow between rising
spires of rock to the east, the valley's steep cliffs forming a
cul-de-sac a few hundred feet in that direction.

Road Through the Basin Land~
The crumbling road winds across the ice-cracked basin, heading directly
towards the foaming river.  Pine trees grows beside the road, forming a
windbreak that offers welcomed shelter from the bitterly cold winds that
can gust from the high peaks above.  A smattering of purple-spotted
hemlock grows between the shattered rocks, their clusters of pale white
flowers coated with icy-dew.

Under the Massive Pine~
Under the branches of the massive pine a dense layer of pine needles
muffles any footfall.  The gnarled branches overhead form a lattice of
tangled limbs.  The sweet smell of sap hangs in the air.  The remains of
a rope ladder dangle from a higher branch, the tattered end about ten
feet up.  A slender opening in the canopy leads eastwards back into the
cold basin land.

massive pine tree~
The ancient pine spreads its branches wide, obscuring the view of the sky
above and offering shelter for a weary traveler.  Its gnarled bark is
full of knots and ripples, stained with thick golden sap in many places. 
Thick layers of pine needles, many green and freshly fallen, carpet the
forest floor, partially hiding the mighty tree's roots which protrude
from the ground in random locations.  One particulary large root curves
around slightly, the gap between it and the tree forming a small basin
filled with needles - an ideal resting place in the wilderness.

Beside the Crumbling Cliffs~
Huge slabs of rock spread out across the basin land, a scattering of
tussock plants growing between the stones.  Apart from the tussock, only
purple-hued lichen appears to be able to flourish upon the rocks. 
Further eastward, the cliffs stretch up over three hundred feet in
height, the frost-covered stones gleaming.  Toward the west, the valley
becomes increasingly navigable, a forest-flanked river flowing through
the basins centre.

Road Through the Basin Land~
The broken rocks cluster around the road, forming a narrow ravine as it
winds northward.  The gleaming waters of a mountain river sparkle to the
north, a waterfall across the valley floor the water's source.  Westward
light pine woodlands stretch out into the distance, the smell of sap and
rotting vegetation filling the air.  A huge tree rises beside the cliffs
to the south; nearly a hundred feet tall, it dominates the southern view.

Road Through the Basin Land~
The walls of the ravine rise high, almost forming a tunnel above the
ancient roadway.  A crumbling waystone lies beside the broken cobbles of
the trail, its fractured surface worn smooth by the passing years.  The
sound of a river echoes near by, a wall of icy mist splashing down upon
the roadway when the winds gust from the north.  Toward the south the
road heads out of the shadowy ravine and heads onward across the basin
land.  Overhead, the mighty peaks of the Everwinter mountains gleam with
icy peaks.  Dark, brooding storm clouds nestle around their tops, the
rumble of distant thunder echoing across the valley.

The ravine's cracked and pitted walls begin to reduce in height, allowing
a good view of the spreading pine forest that stretches westward and the
rushing waters of a mountain river to the north.  Tendrils of frost coat
the exposed rock surfaces, the icy ribbons gleaming brightly.  The road
winds northward to a narrow bridge that spans the rushing waters.  Beyond
the waters, ruins rise out of the basin, the remnants of walls and
buildings surrounded by a scattering of fir trees.

The turbulent waters of the mountain river rush through a steep-cliff
ravine, which has been gorged out by the fast flowing wake.  The tips of
water-worn boulders jut from the white-waters.  An ancient, slender stone
bridge spans the waters, the entire structure shaking with the force of

into the rushing waters of the mountain river.  The white-waters foam

spans the narrow ravine, allowing access to the basin lands beyond. 
Northward the side of the valley rises upward, a waterfall cascading
down from a high plateau a few hundred feet up.

Ruined City - Before a Crumbling Tower~
Rising out of the fir trees is the remnants of a once-stout watchtower. 
Encircling the cracked stone walls is a belt of broken wood and
shattered clay tiles, all that is left of the towers roof and upper story. 
Despite the loss of the top the tower still stretches over thirty feet in
height.  An archway opens into the tower to the west, two scraggy fir
trees lining the way.  Southward the ancient road leads to a single span
bridge that crosses a narrow ravine.  The northern waterfall drowns out
most sounds and sends sheets of soaking ice-cold mist into the air.

Once proud and tall, the watchtower is now a crumbling ruin.  It is hard

the tower's base.  An archway is built into the tower's eastern wall, now
partially blocked by piles of broken wood.  Judging by their looks, they
must have come from the tower's sturdy door.  In the days long past, the

Ruined Tower - Stairwell~
The rubble-filled circular chamber is a little over twenty feet across. 
Two stairwells have been built against the western wall, the upper one
almost torn from the wall with several of the stone steps missing.  The
descending staircase appears to be in better condition, only a few cracks
and fissures upon the stonework.  Rotting stalls fill the northern
section, mounds of decaying hay piled in each.  An archway leads between
flanking fir trees into the ruins, the sound of a waterfall clear.

Beneath the Ruined Tower~
Against the northern wall a crumbling staircase rises out of the dank
room, much of the stones worn smooth by the passage of feet and time. 
Broken wagon-sized barrels fill much of the chamber, at one time used for
distillation of wine or ale; a sharp vinegar smell emanates from the
stained wood.  A mound of rock and dirt lies piled in the middle of the
room, its centre, a gloomy hole that leads downwards into the darkness. 
The remains of torch sconces line the walls, the stonework around each 
darkened by soot.

Edge of the Frostfur Woods~
Walls of fir trees grow in a rough crescent shape around a water-filled
basin of rock.  Mounds of rotting needles line the edge of the pool's
edge, the brackish water alive with tiny insects that appear to live on
and around the vegetation.  Beyond the pool the woodlands become
increasingly dense with brambles and ivy thriving under the canopy.

Basin Land - Beside the Rushing River~
Icy-speckled dew coats the exposed cracked and weather-worn rocks. 
Below, a cliff drops about thirty feet toward a rushing mountain river. 
The foaming, white waters surge westward, the splashing waves sending a
cloud of chilling mist skyward.  Fir trees become increasingly common
toward the west until they form a light forest.  Eastward, a single
span bridge crosses the river gorge allowing passage to the northern
bank.  Beyond the ravine, ruins speckle the landscape, the remnants of a
fairly sizable township lie in the shadows of the Everwinter Mountains. 
A waterfall cascades down the cliff side from a plateau at least one
hundred feet above the basin land.

single span bridge 1 eastward~
The stone masonry of the bridge appears to be that of dwarven design -
its not the immaculately squared-off blocks of granite, nor the
pedantically curved parabola that arches from one side of the ravine to
the other, though both of these contribute greatly to the impression of
dwarven creation.  The most telltale sign of dwarven craftsmanship is the
signature runes etched onto every other block.  Despite being rather
weathered, they still seem in very good condition, though the symbols
appear to be in an archaic form of the language.

Basin Land - Beside the River Gorge~
Hammered into the fissures of a slab of basalt rock are rusted iron
pitons, a trail of spikes leading down the edge of the ravine and on to a
narrow water-drenched ledge at the river edge.  To the east, walls of
broken rocks rise upward and become the rough base of the high cliffs
beyond.  The turbulent white-waters of the mountain river surge down from
a massive northern waterfall and hurtle westward though the valley's basin.

At the River's Edge~
A little over four feet across, the narrow shelf of rock clings to the
cliff side just above the roaring white-waters of a rushing mountain river. 
Hammered into the southern face are rusted iron pitons, allowing for a
difficult climb out of the ravine.  Beside the pitons, a dark fissure has
opened in the rocks, a bed of dried moss scattered across its floor. 
Toward the west a stone bridge spans the river, its supporting pillars
shuddering under the pressure of the turbulent waters.

Cave Beside the Mountain River~
The interior of the natural cave is remarkably dry and snug considering
the rushing river only feet away.  A layer of sphagnum moss blankets the
floor, a mound of moss and lichen forming a crude bed against the
southern wall.  Faint paintings of huge wool-covered animals adorn the
ceiling, their details poor due to their age.  A lop-sided hole in the
far back wall opens into a dark passageway.

Ruined City - Ancient roadway~
Between the crumbling remnants of stone buildings winds the ancient
cobbled road, rubble and fir saplings covering its pitted surface. 
Wild flowers grow between the rubble, their surface covered in bright
blooms.  Further to the east a mist-shrouded ravine splits the basin in
two, the rushing sound of water echoing from its bottom.  Westward a
ruined tower rises, by far the highest building still standing.  A
weatherworn sign hangs in front of a mound of rubble that once was a
building, the faded image of a sword and shield visible on the wood.

Ruined City - Four Way Junction~
A courtyard of cobblestones spreads out for about thirty feet in each
direction, ruins of houses and shops scattered about its fringes.  Four
roads converge upon the clearing, a statue of a dwarven warrior standing
guard over each one.  Grooves of wagons have been worn into the cobbles,
most now filled with damp moss and leaf-litter.  Chilling tendrils of
mist dance between the fir trees and ruins, obscuring details in a
blanket of white.

The road bends northward, following the crumbling edge of a water-filled
ravine.  Foaming rapids send out chilling clouds of misty spray into the
air, leaving the area shrouded in perpetual fog.  Remains of buildings hug
the road, rocks and wood spew from their husks, like the entrails of a
slaughtered beast.  Rising above the shattered city are the Everwinter
mountains, their peaks gleaming with ice.

waterfall thunders down from the high cliffs, the surging waters carving

Mounds of broken bricks, rafters and roofing tiles lie scattered beside

high, most are weather-worn and dangerously unstable.  Further to the
north a few buildings appear in better condition; closer to the mountain's
cliffs they may be sheltered from some of the harsh elements that lash
the basin land.  Toward the west the road enters a cobbled courtyard,
exits leaving in all directions.

Twisted metal and shattered stones spill out from the shell of a

forming a tangled blockage that slows passage to the north.  Southward,
the ancient road heads back into the rubble-filled city, running beside a
narrow, river-filled ravine.  Beyond the broken gatehouse, a single span
bridge has collapsed, dangling by one flimsy rope into the ravine.

Swirling mist coats the landscape in a mantle of white, the vague

the edge of a burbling pool, the roar of the waterfall pouring into it

ravine from years of flow.  Beyond the pool, the basin land rises sharply
upward, blocking any further passage.  A white stone monolith rises
beside the waterfall, the gleaming stone smooth and unadorned.

The distant sound of rushing waters echoes throughout the mist-shrouded
landscape, the exact sound's source unclear.  The slumped carcasses of

remaining to identify them as houses and shops.  Westward the shattered

Ruined City - Before the West Gate~
A segmented stone wall cuts its way through the thickening fir woods in a
north-south direction.  The cracked rock face has been pitted with years
of harsh winters and lack of maintenance; despite this it still reaches
over twenty feet in hight, the top covered in broken branches and loose
rubble.  The road leads up to a squat gatehouse, the timbers and
stonework charred with fire-damage.  Mounds of water-soaked soot spread
around the building.  Beyond the burnt-out gates the woodlands become
increasingly dense, the fir trees cluster together with barely an ogres

of the city, its cobbles coated in debris from houses and trees.

squat gatehouse timbers stonework fire-damage fire damage~
Blackened stones and crumbling timbers are all that remain of the stout
gatehouse.  The interior has been completely gutted by a blazing fire at
some time in the mist-shrouded past leaving gaping holes in the walls and
ceiling that now surrender to the forces of nature.  Waterlogged floor
boards have swollen disproportionately with countless years of constant
rainfall, causing the wood to warp and distort along the grain. 
Soot-covered pools form in the shallow dips that ripple the creaking
floor.

The Icy Pool~
Turbulent waters churn the pool's surface till it foams; waves crash
against the rocks sending clouds of chilling mist skyward.  The thundering
waterfall impacts to the north, the very rocks and water vibrating with
the force.  Toward the south, over a lip of grey stone, the river rushes
down into the gorge; anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in the
river's current would surely drown if they managed to avoid being smashed
upon the jagged outcrops of partially submerged rocks.

waterfall thundering 1 north~
Towering several yards overhead, the thundering waterfall rises like a
monolith to the north.  A great spray of water coats the surrounding
rocks with cool water; a slippery layer of algae thrives just beneath the
surface of the moisture.  On rocks that are a little further removed from
the churning waters of the deep pool, dew spangled moss clings to the
jagged cliffs.  At the southern end of the pool, the smaller stones have
been washed together to form a shallow embankment, hidden beneath the icy
waters, that gives way to a deep cut ravine a little further on.

Ruined City - Before the West Gate~
Fir trees grow in dense clusters around the wall of the mountain township. 
An overgrown cobbled road winds its way westward, further into the
woodlands.  A fire-damaged building lies directly eastward, the remains
of a gatehouse. Across ground tendrils of frost spread, their crystalline
surface gleaming.  Attached to a nearby branch is what appears to be a
tattered scalp of a goblin or orc, the tufts of black hair tangled with
bird bones.

Edge of the Frostfur Woods~
Mounds of pine needles and bracken spread beneath the tightly packed fir
trees, their surfaces coated in a light layer of frost.  The cool air is
suprisingly still, the muffled sound of a river burbling some way to the
south.  A debris-covered ancient road winds beneath the tangled branches
of the firs, travellers along its path having to duck and weave to avoid
the tree limbs.  Overhead the gleaming peaks of the Everwinter mountains
spread, their icy summits surrounded by storm clouds.

Running parallel to the eastern wall is a narrow trail, the tangled roots
of fir trees often obscuring the passageway.  Across the bark of lower
branches some creature has scraped deep groves, the weeping sap giving
off a pungent aroma.  A spire of rock juts from the forest floor, rising
a little over ten feet in hight.  Nestled in its shady base are a swathe
of stinging nettles and foxfur ferns.  Further southward the tress form
a tangled wall of growth, blocking any view of what lies beyond.  The
gurgling sound of rushing waters filter throughout the woodlands.

Taller fir trees close ranks around the ancient road, creating a
dwindling pathway to the west.  An earthen bank runs along the roadside,
its surface coated in lush ferns and woody bracken.  Mounds of needles
litter the ground, the rich smell of sap and decay hanging heavy in the
air.  Some way to the south a river can be faintly heard.  Tangled in a
high branch dangles a goblin scalp, the tattered edges covered in
blue-black runes.

Running through the fir tree forest is a narrow trail.  A speckled
collection of stones lie scattered across the path, perhaps an attempt to
mark the often overgrown passage.  Under the boughs of the trees lie
mounds of pine needles, their surface home to brightly capped toadstools. 
A spire of rock, a little over ten feet high, rises to the north, its
surface covered in ferns and bracken.  The trail bends to the west and
continues deeper into the woods.  The roar of a river echoes from the
south, the ground underfoot rumbling slightly.

gleaming brightly.  Running through the woodlands is a narrow trail, its

The gnarled branches of elder fir trees spread across the path reducing
the visiblity and forcing travellers to duck and weave around them.  The
woodlands become increasingly dense further to the west, the trail
disappearing at the base of a particularly stout pine tree.  A withered and
split fir tree grows against the edge of a crumbling ravine, the mist from
a mountain river visible at the gourge's bottom.  Bracken and ivy spread
across the forest floor, their leaves coated with a light dusting of
frost.

whispering song of the forest.  Eastward a fern-covered ridge of rock

Weaving between the stands of fir trees the narrow trail does its best to
follow the cracked and pitted edge of the river gorge.  Across the other

ravine, a rock cairn built beside it.  Beyond the bridge the forest rises
slightly, becoming increasingly dank and shadow-filled.

The dense vegetation and tangled branches make for a difficult passage as
the forest grows increasingly inhospitable to travelers.  Lush ivy
entwines around branches and trunks of the gnarled fir trees, the leaves
a dull purple hue.  The pungent smell of sap oozes from broken tree limbs. 
As the road heads westward, it begins to rise, a few patches of grass
clustered round its edges.  The melodic cries of unseen birds mix with
the distant sounds of a river far to the south.

Honeysuckle spreads across the lower branches and roots of several stout
fir trees, the pale green leaves almost lost in the dense fir needles. 
Exposed rocks become increasingly common further to the north, the
landscape rising steeply in that direction.  Trees begin to thin, giving
way to brambles and thistles that thrive between the boulders.  High
above, a road cuts across the cliff face heading in an east-west direction. 
A blanket of mist cloaks the eastern basin in a veil of white.

With outer foliage dipped in a coating of frost, the leaves and ferns of

the lower limbs of the fir trees.  Fractured chunks of stone spread out
through the forest, the littered remains of an ancient landslide.  Rising
upward to the north are the cliffs of the Everwinter mountains, their
rugged surface bare of life.  Just visible through the dense undergrowth
are the remnants of a cobbled path.  Through the trees to the west, the
path descends into a tiny valley.

Rushing through the gorge's middle is a torrenting river, the swirling
waters churned white with the furious rush.  Eastward a narrow swing
bridge spans the river, allowing travel onward into the northern
woodlands.  Further to the west the water course reaches the edge of the

Rising beside the falls is a ruined tower, the broken walls gleaming with

slender fissures that mar the rock.  A delicate coating of frost coats
the tips of the bracken and ferns that grow under the southern trees, the

Edge of the Frostfur Woods - Waterfall~
Thundering waters from the swallen mountain river rush over the plateau's
edge and cascade down in a surging waterfall over one hundred feet in
height.  Far below a lake spreads out, the white-waters spreading waves
across its blue-green surface.  Clouds of mist rise from the torrent,
obscuring much of the dank fir forest that clusters near the ravines edge. 
Brambles and ferns spread under the water-coated trees, their foliage
coated in a layer of frost.  Cut along the southern cliff side is a narrow
trail framed by the fall on one side and the dense fir trees on the other. 
Jutting out on a shelf of rock is the remnants of a crumbling tower, the
cracked and broken building a few stories high.

Cliff Side Trail~
Jutting out into the windswept cliff face the crumbling overhang rumbles
with the vibrations from the crashing waterfall, mere stone's throw away. 
A solitary pine tree grows from the shallow earth of the outcrop, the
branches bent and twisted and mostly bare.  A ruined watchtower rises to
the south, the three remaining stories pitted and cracked with age. 
Eastward a trail winds beside the rushing river gorge, heading deep into
the fir forest.

Cliff Side Trail - Before a Ruined Tower~
Encircling the base of the crumbling tower is a squat stone wall, the
boulders cracked and broken.  Built upon a rocky outcrop that juts out
from the cliff, the tower would offer a great view of the surrounding
lands.  Clouds of mist swirl up from a rushing waterfall to the
northeast, the billowing vapours obscuring the woodland and lower portion
of the tower.  Clusters of fir trees gather around the narrow trail,
their tangled roots digging into the shallow soil.

Tower Beside the Falls~
A cobbled yard spreads before the tower, the cracks between each brick
filled with moss and immature ferns and bracken, giving the surface a
patchwork appearance.  Surrounding the tower and yard is a squat stone
wall, a little over four feet in height.  Swirling mist rolls over the
stonework, the chilling clouds obscuring the landscape beyond the tower. 
The vague outlines of trees spread out eastward, their tall forms moving
slightly.  The roar of a thundering waterfall rumbles through the rocks,
the dull vibrations making tiny pebbles dance about.  Beyond a short
flight of steps, a solid oak and iron-bound door has been set into the
tower; the keystone above the entrance is carved with twin interlocked
axes.

Cliff Side Trail~
Cut into the mountain side is a narrow cave, its mouth draped with
tangled moss and tree roots that partially obscure it from view.  A
strong bestial smell emanates from its dark recesses, a smattering of
bones littering the ground around it.  The narrow trail winds northward
toward the remains of a watchtower or simillar building, the crumbling
cliff side dropping down at least one hundred feet to the basin land
below.  The fir trees that scatter the land form a dense woodland to the
east, the outer edge coated in a layer of gleaming frost.

Inside the Cave~
The walls and floor of the shallow cavern are covered in deep gorged
claw marks.  The rank stench of musk saturates the air making breathing
unpleasant.  Rotting bracken has been dragged into a sizeable mound at the
cave mouth, the chewed remains of animal bones littering the pile.  At
some point the cave appears to have continued southward, a section of
the ceiling crashing down to seal the passage.  From the cave mouth the
edge of the plateau winds northward, a narrow trail following its
crumbling side.  In the distance a ruined building sits, framed by
billowing white clouds that swirl around it.

Edge of the Frostfur Woods~
Cutting into the light woodlands runs a narrow dirt trail.  At its muddy
border slender grasses spread out, the carpet continuing a way under the
trees before being replaced by clumps of ferns and bracken.  Westward
the trail dips downward and begins a perilous journey beside a crumbling
cliffs edge.  The distant thunder of water drifts through the dense fir
trees, its exact source unseen.

Stacks of slivery-hued boulders rise up beside the path, their swirled

appearing fir trees spread, forming into a sizable woodland.

Narrow Trail Through the Basin Land~
A few scraggly pines grow beside the rubble-covered trail.  Spires of
basalt rock jut from the mountain side to the west, their gleaming
surfaces reflecting light.  Spread under the trees are a light sprinkling
of pine needles, their surface coated in tendrils of frost.  An ancient
cobbled road cuts through the mountainside to the south, the way
partially blocked by a landslide.  Northward, tall fir gather close
together, forming a dense woodland.  The distant rumble of a rushing
river echoes through the basin land.

Clinging to a Craggy Cliff~
Ample handholes make the climb easy despite the patches of frost and ice
covering the cliff side; the way onward appears to be similar in
difficulty.  Dew-coated bracken thrusts out from the grey rocks, growing
in cracks and fissures where enough soil has been trapped.  Overhead the
cliff appears to cut inward, perhaps reaching a summit.  Below, the
forest spreads out, the wisps of fog clinging to the pine-trees branches. 
Far to the east a sparkling river winds, cutting its way through the
basin land.

Spanning out at the foot of the cliff face, a mist-shrouded forest

a sparkling river weaves to and fro as it carries the chill mountain
waters off to the east.  Muted sounds permeate from the wide basin below;
it almost seems as though the land has been subdued by the chill of
winter, with most creatures seeking shelter in which to pass the colder
weather.

Upon an Ancient Road~
An ancient cobblestone road cuts into the mountainside, its cracked and
pock-marked surface barely visible under layers of rocks and patches of
gleaming snow.  Above the road, a jutting cliffside forms a protective
overhang against all sorts of inclement weather.  Eastward, the road
bends around the basin's edge, before disappearing out of sight around a
crumbling landslide.  To the west, the road is blocked by a recent
landslide that prevents passage; beyond the slip a glimpse of the road
can be seen further to the north before it finally disappears from view.

Winding around the crumbling edge of the basin runs the cobbled road, its

the road, the ruins of a township spread, a blanket of mist surrounding
much of the northern section.  Beyond the ruins, pine tress gather around
a sparkling river, the trees bending and swaying in the almost constant
wind.  Further toward the east a thundering waterfall crashes down the
mountain side, its source somewhere to the north of the roadway. 
Westward the road follows the valley's edge, its destination unseen.

Cutting its way through the mountainside winds the cobbled road.  Beside

meters then bends east, once more.  Below, the ruins of a city spread, a
dense cloud of mist obscuring much of the rubble.  Further toward the

off the cliff's edge and forming a thunderous waterfall.

Carved out of the grey-stone of the mountain the chamber is a little over
ten feet across.  A partially decayed leather curtain hangs across the
eastern opening, keeping some of the icy gusts from entering the room. 
Fine cracks in the ceiling allow for some of the smoke to escape,
although the stains around the roof show it is often less than ideal. 
The scattered remains of a bracken filled bed lie against the northern

Stairs Within a Ruin~
The spiral staircase continues onward, the rubble and broken beams of
wood making for a tight squeeze at several locations.  Copper sconces jut
from the walls, a few remnants of torches still held within.  The chill
permeates the very stone, leaving everything cool to the touch; the musty
smell of still air hangs over the ruins like a funerary shroud.

spiral staircase~
The central column of this spiral staircase was, at one time, intricately
sculptured with statues of dwarven warriors, however they are now in a
state of disrepair.  The derelict figures stand with broken off noses,
chipped beards and partially destroyed weapons; many have been
purposefully defaced at some point in time.  The stairs have been worn
down by uncountable footfalls, some broken into fragments of rock that
lay strewn across the steps below.
~
E
rubble beams~
Scattered across the steps are large fragments of rock and broken wooden
beams.  The debris has been left to accumulate until it now blocks the
majority of the staircase making it a little difficult to navigate past. 
A few hooks jut out from the splintered beams, presumably to hang
lanterns from, though many are now too bent to be much good for anything.

Within the Ruined Tower~
In the center of the chamber lies a spiral stairwell.  Despite the amount
of rubble and debris scattered around, it still allows passage downward
into the mountain itself.  Stone pillars rise from each of the room's
corners, three of them reaching the ceiling.  The northeastern one is
shattered about half-way along its length, the remnants scattered around
its base.  An opening in the northern wall leads into an entrance room, a
grassy plateau visible through an open doorway.

stairwell rubble debris~
Shattered rock, broken beams and decaying leaves have been knocked about
the room and many have fallen a few steps down the spiral staircase
partially blocking the entrance downward.  Much of the rubble is crowded
about the central pillar of the staircase leaving perhaps a foot at the
outer edge of the stairs clear from debris.
~

pillars corners~
Heavyset stone pillars rise up to meet the ceiling in each corner of the
room.  Runic hieroglyphs, etched into the smooth stone surfaces, betell of
the ancestry of this tower, the runes appear to be, for the most part,
names of dwarves who spent their lives creating this place.  The
northeastern pillar has been shattered about halfway up; the little that
remains of it now lies despondently upon the littered stone floor.

1 north opening plateau~
Through the northern doorway it is possible to see a wide grassy plateau
that stretches out beyond the entrance of this derelict tower.  The
ceiling of the room north from here has collapsed in on itself and a slow
invasion of moss and lichen has started to creep into the weather-beaten
room.  Great cracks have formed in the archway to the north, the rock
slowly succumbing to the bitter elements of nature.

Within the Ruined Tower~
Most of the chamber has collapsed upon itself, leaving a narrow walkway
between the rubble.  An arched opening to the south allows passage into
a vaulted chamber, its stonework in better condition than here.  Lichen
and moss grow upon the mounds of rubble, reclaiming the stones slowly but
surely.  The remnants of iron-bound doors lie scattered beside a northern
opening.  Beyond the doors, a tussock-filled plateau stretches to the
edge of a mountain lake, the icy-blue waters sparkling.  A ravine cuts
through the valley, the churning waters of a mountain river filling its
bottom.  Surrounding the lake is a dappled forest, the pine trees tightly
packed around the lake and mountain sides.  Picking its way across the
grassland is the remains of a cobbled road, barely visible through the
weeds.

iron-bound doors 1 north~
At some point, these doors must have been magnificent to behold; the rich
mahogany wood reinforced by strong wrought iron bracing.  Now, the wood
has all but decayed and the iron reinforcement has turned orange brown in
colour as excessive moisture and lack of maintenance has slowly rusted
the metal.  Lying on the ground next to the decomposing doors are the
twisted and deformed hinges that used to be attached to either side of
the doorway, the crumbling stone having surrendered them to the harsh
elements.

The source of the majority of this rubble is blatantly apparent - the

a similar fate.  Clinging to the cracks and crevices in the stone rubble,
dark green moss and lichen thrive upon the damp conditions created by the
open ceiling.

Mountain Plateau - Beside a Crumbling Tower~
Broken slabs of rock and crumbling stone rise into the wind-swept spires
of an ancient tower that prevent passage to the east.  Beyond their
jagged faces the sound of a raging river echoes, a cloud of spray often
shooting skyward.  Grass and tussock compete for dominance of the lower
slopes, but as the valley rises upward a forest begins to take hold. 
Further north, the splintered edges of the mountains begin to creep
across the valley.  A lake is visible in the distance, nestled in a high
pass and surrounded by fir trees.

Bending around the tattered edge of a cliff, the rutted road appears to

Far to the east a waterfall tumbles from the mountainside, hurtling into

The roadway ends at the edge, of a tussock filled plateau, the cobbles

Further to the east lies a crystal-clear lake, a burbling river
pouring from it and winding across the grasslands before forming a
torrenting waterfall.  At the falls edge, the ruins of a tower rise, the
crumbling structure a little over one story high.

A rutted goat trail, flanked by spires of rock on one side and grassland
on the other, flows along the plateau to the north and south.  Under the
worn surface are the scattered remnants of cobble stones, an indication
that this was once a major road in this land.  As it heads northward, it
begins to rise with the terrain, the tussock and grasses being replaced
by bare rocks and a scattered copse of trees.  Beyond the grassland, a
mountain pass cuts through the hills, its destination hidden beyond the
distant horizon.

surrounded by a dense forest.  A few yards further on, sizable landslide
blocks the start of what appears to be a narrow path that descends
through the northern hills in that direction.

A clean but cluttered study fills most of the circular chamber.  A walnut
desk pushed against the stairs entrance gives it a feel more like that of
a shop than a home.  Stacks of dog-eared parchments lie scattered beyond
the desk, most bound with ribbons of different colors.  A sturdy oak
chair lies buried beneath a sea of books in the rooms center, a clear
space between it and the room being encroached upon by stacks of reeds
and clay pots.  Just visible behind a velvet curtain in the south is a
double posted bed, the base stripped and a stack of clean linen piled
upon it.

Upon an Ancient Road~
Mounds of shale-like rubble have spilled across the road, the leavings of
an ancient avalanche.  In its rocky wake, the shattered remnants of
long-felled pines lie broken and shattered.  Stretching for at least
thirty yards across, it appears to be unstable and impassable.  Below the
roadway, a fir forest thrives, a cool mist rising from beneath its dark
canopy.  A glint of water, nestled within a fold in the land, lies some
distance away toward the southwest.

Pass through the Everwinter Range~
Little more that a game trail, the roadway shows brief glimpses of its
former glory with the occasional patch of well-set cobbles.  Loose rocks
and rubble have buried most of the path, leaving little room to move. 
Northward, the crumbling edge of a valley spirals downward, the sheltered
valley below verdant with a lush green forest.  Eastward, the road bends
around an outcropping of granite and heads southward through the
mountains.  Toward the west, the roadway is blocked by falling debris. 
The mountains rise close around, oppressive and grey.

Pass through the Everwinter Range~
A scattering of disloged cobbles lie across the cracked and broken path,
the remnants of the former roadway.  Scraggly bushes cluster around a
granite outcropping, their near-leafless branches bent and warped by the
strong mountain winds.  The road bends around the rock spire and starts
to descend into a forested valley to the south, the mountains beginning to
lose their height to become hills.  Far in the distance, the sea spreads
out, the white tips of waves visible across the green and blue ocean.

Old Road Through the Forest~
A few scattered pines grow beside the ancient roadway, their tangled
roots upheaving several of the crumbling roads remaining cobbles.  The
rich, sweet smell of pine gum fills the air, as the copse of trees turns
into a lush pine forest toward the south.  Rising slightly as it heads
northward, the road appears to deteriorate until it is little more than a
goat trail.

Old Road Through the Trees~
Surrounded by the young pines, the cobbled roadway winds to the north and
south.  Mounds of pine needles blanket the ground beneath the underbrush,
effectively preventing much growth except the occasional toadstool.  The
canopy above becomes increasingly tangled, as the branches interweave
together.  Toward the north, the towering peaks of ice-capped mountains
rise against the distant horizon.

Road Through The Pine Forest~
The gnarled-barked red pines cluster around the roadway, effectivly
forming a tunnel of branches and trunks.  Many of the older trees show
signs of fire damage to their branch tips, the scars of a past blaze. 
Underfoot, a few cobbles are barely visible through the blanket of
rotting pine needles.  The overgrown roadway heads northward out of the
valley and bends westward to continue further into the forest.

Road Through The Pine Forest~
The stumps of several large trees lie in a small glade to the west.  A
cobbled trail bends around the clearing, heading southward toward the
forest's edge and eastward into the denser foliage.  Slender pine
saplings rise around the perimiter, each one attempting to grow enough to
block the light.  An ancient road way runs in an east and southerly
direction, its surface covered in pine needles and branches.

Roadway at the Forest's Edge~
The hills rise up around the valley, forming impressive cliffs in all
directions but southward.  An ancient roadway winds across the valley
floor skirting the sweeping cliffs.  Beyond the southern rim of the basin
land, the landscape drops down sharply , descending towards the spreading
blue-green sea.  Scattered ruins dot the northern forest, their origins
unknown.  On either side of the road, a thick forest extends out into the
valley.
