Tar'Ippal Slave Pit Rbug Room~
~
[Rikahn] Zone Concept: Pkill zone with roleplaying reasons to visit for
both light-raced players and dark-raced players.  Dark overlords command
a pit of light slaves.  The slaves were captured exploring nearby and
taken to the pit, where they have been methodically tortured and used to
expand the caverns.  The slaves have begun to revolt, infuriating the
overlords into beating them savagely, sometimes to the point of death. 
Dark-raced players should visit the zone to assist the overlords in
slaughtering the rebellious slaves, whereas light-raced players should
free the slaves by killing the overlords.
[Rikahn] The pit itself is flagged as a pkill zone, though the two
landings overlooking the pit are not.  Overlords and slaves are allowed
to roam the zone freely, with occasional acodes emulating the torture of
the slaves.
[Rikahn] Slaves are L10, Overlords are L25.  Intentional.  This is
primarily a dark-raced killing field.  Crossing racial lines causes the
overlords to call for assistance and do more damage, same with slaves.
[Rikahn] Rdescs are intentionally somewhat short, reducing spam while
players are exploring the pkill portion of the zone.

#2701
Edge of the Slave Pit~
A tangled rope ladder dangles down from above, its lowest rungs coiled up
in a pile on the ground.  Attached to a wooden landing high above that
juts forth from a southern cliff, it appears sturdy enough to climb
without breaking.  A sprawling cavern opens up to the north and east,
although what perils await is difficult to tell through the inky darkness.

tangled rope ladder lowest rungs coiled pile ground~
Danging down from the wooden landing above, the rope ladder is strong
and sturdy.  Two-inch thick lengths are knotted a foot apart, making an
easy climb.  The bottom sections of the rope are coiled on the ground,
the rest of the ladder kept somewhat taut by the ladder's weight.
~
E
wooden landing cliff 1 south~
A vertical cliff rises up to the south, the only means of travel in that
direction a rope ladder that dangles down from above.  Scratch marks are
visible on top of the stone, left by slaves attempting to escape.

Walking straight up a vertical wall isn't one of your known skills. 
Climbing up the ladder would probably better suit your abilities.

#2702
Edge of the Slave Pit~
The cold stone walls turn inward to the north, leading back into the
musty-smelling cavern.  A vertical shelf leads upwards to the south,
where a wooden platform projects from a ledge visible high above. 
Dangling over the edge of the platform is a thick rope ladder, its lower
rungs weighted down with heavy iron discs.

stone walls vertical shelf~
Rising straight up into the air, a stone wall blocks access further to
the south.  About twenty feet up, a ledge breaks the vertical climb,
although the only access to those lofty heights is a rope ladder,
dangling down from above.
~
E
wooden platform ledge 1 up~
Built on top and over the lip of the cliff to the south, a wooden
platform offers a safe haven for the evil overlords.  Allowing them to
overlook much of the cavern from one location, the landing appears to be
the only exit out of the slave pit.
~
E
thick rope ladder lower rungs heavy iron discs~
Knotted a foot apart, rope rungs offer purchase for climbing the hemp
ladder that hangs from the wooden platform above.  Weighted down at its
base by dense iron discs, it remains taut enough to stay in place even
when being used.

Slave Pit~
Situated near its middle, this portion of the cavern is quiet in
relationship to the hotspots of activity around the pit's perimeter.  A
rock column is visible to the northwest, that the overlords use to stand
over the slaves and shout orders.  Ladders leading upwards can be seen
far to the north and south, the only means of escaping alive.  The dank
pit extends in all directions, drifting into darkness.

Rising up a few feet off of the floor, a circular column of rock has been
left alone through the cavern's mining as a vantage point for the
overlords to shout orders and observe the slaves.

ladders upwards 1 north 1 south~
Their outlines barely visible in the dusky cavern, ladders can just be
seen, leading upward into the ceiling in the distance far to the
north and south.  Evidently the only exits out of the pit, numerous
tracks in the floor lead in their directions.

Slave Pit~
Centralized within the slave pits, this portion of the chamber appears to
be a staging point for the slave labor.  Numerous tracks in the dusty
floor head off in all directions, leading towards the various mining
operations within the cavern.  A column of rock overlooks the pit to the
north, used as a pulpit for the overlords to shout their orders at the
slaves.

Circular in shape, a three-foot tall rock column has been built up to the

track~
Although many of the tracks have been swept away through shifts in the
dust and overlaps, there are enough intact prints to determine that quite
a few different races have come walking through this chamber recently. 
The distinct patterns of ogre and troll feet can be seen leading
northward, ending at the stone column.  The stubby prints of dwarf and
gnome feet trail to the east and west; the tracks must have been moving
very slow, as their trails are elongated out as if dragged.

There are so many footprints leading off in all directions that it is

Slave Pit~
The putrid cavern dips down to the west, where mining continues to take
place further underground.  The air is thick with black fog, specks of
dust hovering in the air after being stirred up from below.  The chamber
remains level in all other directions, except for a rock column that
stands to the northeast, used as an outpost for the cruel overlords.

With no wind to sweep it away, a thick cloud of coal dust hangs in

Rising up from the chamber floor by just a few feet, a column of rock was

Nestled at the bottom of a steep incline to the east, this landing ends
at a mining excavation underway in the west wall.  Blocky gashes in the
mountainside expose mineral deposits, each one ready to be pried out for
smelting.  A new section of the pit is being carved out nearby to the
north, where the slaves have begun digging a tunnel westward.

slaves and carted off to be processed.  Rich chunks of ore gleam out from
the otherwise dull sides of the cavern, although their true size and
value cannot be gauged at first glance.
~
E
mineral deposits~
Glinting in the light, tiny pockets of rich mineral ore contrast against
the dull gray mountainside.  Most of the pieces are no bigger than a
pebble, but chunks the size of fists poke out in some places.
~
E
tunnel~
Its entrance barely visible from this angle, a shallow tunnel has been
started by the slaves in an effort to get a clearer view at a rich vein
of ore.

Slave Pit~
A diagonal stripe of black coal contrasts with the gray stone walls,
looking like a streak of death.  Chunks of the coarse material have been
mined out, leaving pockmarks in the surface.  Situated on a narrow
horizontal landing, this chamber lies slightly below the rest of the
slave pit, the only access back into the main chamber being a wide
incline to the east, or continuing along the wall to the south.

E
diagonal stripe black coal streak death pockmarks surface~
Peppered with pockmarks along the surface from mining, a jagged vein of
coal has been uncovered during the cavern excavation.  Chunks of the
precious minerals have been chipped away and carted off back to the
nearby town for processing.
~
E
gray stone walls~
The strata of gray rock in this section of the cavern is a little lighter
in color than the rest, but only by a few shades.  A dusky black vein of
coal sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison.
~
E
narrow horizontal landing~
Only a few feet wide, the floor of this chamber has been allowed to level
out so the slaves can work on the gaping coal vein to the west.  Sloping
upwards to the east, an incline leads into the rest of the cavern.
~
E
wide incline 1 east~
Sloping upwards at a somewhat steep angle, the only access up into the
remainder of the cavern is an incline to the east.  Somewhat slippery to
traverse, it is coated with a thin layer of coal dust.

Slave Pit~
The stench of rancid sweat pours in from the west, where a vein of ore is
being concentrated upon by the slave labor.  Sloped downward from the
rest of the pit, the chamber is filled with soot and floating dust.  The
air seems fresher in the other directions, although it is difficult to tell
with so many nauseating scents mixing together.  A flattened spire of
rock stands a few feet above the ground to the east, overlooking the rest
of the cavern.

E
vein ore sloped chamber 1 west~
Streaking across the wall like a gaping wound, a deathly-black vein of
coal has been exposed by the slave laborers.  Clouds of thick dust fill
the air from its excavation, the overlords not caring what sort of
unhealthy affects it might cause the slaves.
~
E
soot floating dust~
Floating through the air like a dense fog, miniature specks of soot and
dust obscure most of the chamber to the west.  A lack of wind in this
underground cavern leaves the cloud hovering in mid-air, slowly falling
to the ground.
~
E
flattened spire rock 1 east~
A circular plateau of rock rises up three feet above the rest of the
cavern, giving the overlords an excellent vantage point down into the
slave pit itself.  Its edges are vertical and rough, though traversible
if desired.

Atop a Rock Column~
Standing a few feet above the rest of the cavern floor, this rounded
plateau overlooks most of the oppressive chamber.  Primarily used as an
overlord outpost, ragged gashes around the edge of the column are present
where repetetive whip cracks have chipped away pieces of rock.  The rest
of the pit stretches out in all directions, with the only exits to the
distant north and south.

Shallow gouges have been chipped away from the edge of the plateau, the

Slave Pit~
Sprawling out in all directions, the fetid pit is blanketed in darkness. 
Nearby to the west, a squat rock column oversees the cavern, used as an
outpost for the violent overlords.  Further off to the north, the outline
of a wooden ladder leading upwards out of the pit can barely be made out. 
A heavy blanket of rancid humidity hangs in the air, almost tangible in
strength.

Standing about three feet tall, a rounded plateau of rock juts up from

Through the darkness, you can barely make out the fuzzy edges of a wooden

Slave Pit~
The drone of buzzing flies hums a crescendo of sound, centered around a
corpse hanging limply on the wall.  Shackled in mid-air at its hands and
feet, the bloodied corpse appears to have been a dwarf slave, but it is
difficult to tell with all of the mutilation it has endured.  The
prisoner pit stretches out in numerous directions, although all drop off
into darkness mere feet away.

Edge of the Slave Pit~
A wooden ladder rises up the side of the cliff to the north, tied
together with lengths of hemp rope.  Leading up to a landing high above,
the ladder appears sturdy enough to support almost any person's weight
with ease.  The slave pit continues to the south and west, running around
a rock column converted into an overlord outpost.

wooden ladder lengths hemp rope~
Two beams extend upwards to the landing above, with wooden planks
inserted into notches along their length as rungs.  Knotted loops of hemp
rope keep them in place, their frayed ends splayed out the back.
~
E
cliff landing high above~
Erected at the top of the vertical cliff to the north, a landing is held
aloft by sturdy wooden braces.  Used as an overlook into the pit itself,
the outpost offers a wide view from its lofty perch.
~
E
rock column overlord outpost~
Just off to the southwest, a rock column rises up from the chamber floor. 
Approximately three feet in height, it offers an excellent vantage point
for the overlords to supervise the slave labor.

Edge of the Slave Pit~
A narrow pathway winds it way around a rock column to the south, with
just enough room to move between it and a sheer wall to the north. 
Bloodied white streaks run up and down the wall closer to its base, left
by the frantic clawing of slaves attempting to escape the violent
overlords.  Less confined spaces are visible to the east and west, where
a pair of ladders lead upwards.

Squeezed between the vertical cliff and the rock column to the south,
there is barely enough room to walk east or west through this portion of
the cavern.
~
E
sheer wall 1 north~
A vertical rock wall rises from the cavern floor, leading upwards to the
overlord outpost, jutting out high above.  Long streaks of blood run
down the front of the cliff, left by the frantic scratching of slaves
attempting to escape.
~
E
pair ladders upwards~
Twin wooden ladders, their rungs held in place with hemp ropes, lead
upwards out of the gloomy cavern.  Each ladder flanks this passageway on
either side, providing a means of travel to the landing above.
~
E
bloodied white streaks clawing~
Vertical chalky-looking streaks are gouged into the cliff wall to the
north, where the fingernails of tortured slaves raked across the jagged
rocks.  Trails of blood wind their way down the wall, the crimson trails
still fresh and wet.

Edge of the Slave Pit~
Sandwiched into one corner of the cavern, a rope ladder hangs down from a
wooden landing far above.  Made of an extremely long length of hemp rope,
its knotted rungs are frayed and worn.  A narrow passage leads alongside
the northern cliff to the east, where another ladder in better condition
can be seen in the distance.  The remainder of the cavern sprawls out to
the south, blanketed in darkness.

corner rope ladder long length hemp rope knotted rungs frayed worn~
Almost obscured by the deep shadows of the cavern, a hemp ladder leads
upwards to a wooden landing high above.  Knotted about a foot apart, the
rungs are frayed almost to the point of snapping.  Whether the ladder
could reliably hold your weight is unknown.  A sturdier ladder can be
seen further to the east, on the other side of a narrow passage.
~
E
wooden landing above~
Sticking out a few feet from the gray rock, a wooden landing has been
built about twenty feet up the northern cliff.  A rope ladder leads up to
its lofty perch, though the reliability of its frayed ropes could be in
question.

With just enough room for a party to pass, a narrow gap exists between
the vertical cliff to the north, and a rock column which stands to the
southeast.

Above the Slave Pit~
Projecting over the cavern below, a wooden landing offers a safe haven
for the overlords who control the slave pit.  A rope ladder drapes
downward over the edge, its strands frayed and worn.  Secured to the
platform with two thick knots, it appears unsafe in its poor condition. 
The landing continues to the east, offering a wide view of the prisoners.

The ends of the rope ladder are looped around one of the support beams at
the back of the landing, knotted repeatedly in a jumbled mess.  Each of
the ropes appears in poor condition, with frayed strands poking out in
all directions.  Another ladder is visible off to the east, perhaps in
better condition.

Above the Slave Pit~
Supported by thick oak beams, a platform of age-worn planks has been
erected on top of a ledge overlooking the cavern below.  Situated above a
vertical cliff, it offers an excellent outpost for the overlords to check
on the prisoners in the slave pit.  Rotted wooden railings prevent
onlookers from a painful fall, built at the very edge of the platform.

Faded to the point of almost being white, six-foot long wooden planks

A darkened cavern opens up below the outpost, filled with captured

twenty feet to the chamber floor, the only access down into the pit being
two ladders on either side of this portion of the platform.

Separated six inches apart, a series of rotted rails rise up from the

Above the Slave Pit~
A single broken plank that has been snapped in two mars the surface of
the otherwise orderly-built platform that dangles above the slave pit. 
The rest of the slats have been placed neatly against one another,
providing a stable outpost for the overlords who manage the prisoners.  A
wooden ladder leads downward, its rungs held tightly together with slim
lengths of hemp knots.

intersected beams appears to be safely climbable.  Loops of hemp rope
have been tied at the sides of each rung, with the frayed ends tucked out
of the way towards the back.

Master's Quarters~
This cramped chamber has been carved into an office for the slave pit's
overlord masters.  An oak desk rests in the middle of the floor,
scattered with papers documenting the mineral production of the slave
labor.  A weak glow globe hangs from the ceiling, its light source faintly
throbbing with dwindling power.  Scratch marks are visible on the eastern
wall, organized into clusters.

Almost too thin to be written upon, sheets of woodpulp paper lie
scattered upon the desk in the middle of the room.  Crude charts document
the mining efforts of the slave labor, detailing the amount of coal and
ore extracted then sent back to Tar'ippal for processing.

weak glow globe ceiling~
Housed in a glass orb that dangles from the ceiling, a white ball of

Organized into clusters, repetitive markings have been scratched into the

Above the Slave Pit~
Projecting over the dark, smelly cavern to the north, a wooden platform
provides a vantage point over the slaves held prisoner below.  A thick
rope ladder drapes downward over the edge, the only safe access in or out
of the pit.  The outpost of uneven planks continues to the east, offering
alternate viewpoints of what is happening below.

projecting wooden platform vantage point outpost uneven planks~
Faded wooden planks have been laid out on top of some simple framework
beams above the tunnel's floor.  A projection of longer slats hangs over
the pit to the north, supporting a heavy rope ladder that dangles
downward.  Burnished railings prevent the overlords from falling over the
edge to the east, although none are present along this section of the
platform.

dark smelly cavern pit 1 downward~
With virtually no light shining downward, the chamber below is as dark as
a moonless night.  A foul stench drifts upward, the scent of sweaty
bodies and rotting excrement assaulting the senses.  A thick rope ladder
drapes downward, offering access to the inhospitable cavern.
~
E
thick rope ladder~
Anchored somewhere below the platform, the side lengths of a rope ladder
pop up through the floorboards before dropping off of the edge and into
the dusky pit.  Knots tied about a foot apart give stable purchase,
although care should be taken when climbing because it is quite a drop to
the floor below.

Above the Slave Pit~
A wide platform spreads out from side to side, overlooking a gaping pit
deep underground.  A series of rotted wooden railings prevent the
overlords from falling into the dusky chamber below, as well as contain
whatever is being held within.  Gaps in the railings are visible on
either side of this outpost, offering downward access.  A darkened tunnel
leads southward, heading away from the raunchy-smelling pit.

Above the Slave Pit~
A wooden platform juts partially out over a deep pit.  Braced by extra
beams, it provides a perfect vantage point for observing what is
happening below.  Rotted railings stretch out six inches apart along its
front edge, giving a measure of safety from a painful fall.  A thick rope
ladder dangles between a gap in the railings, allowing access in and out
of the dank-smelling cavern.

At least two inches in diameter, the rope the ladder is made of is quite
sturdy but heavy.  Twists and turns are knotted together, making evenly
spaced rungs.  The ladder leads downward into the murky pit, although

Slave Pit~
A malodorous smell hangs in the air, reminiscent of rotting flesh and
excrement; the source of the stench is a disgusting pool of water to
the east.  The air within the cavern is thick with humidity, almost as
dense as during a heavy rainstorm.  The ground is littered with tiny
bones leftover from some sort of small rodent.  The chamber extends in
three directions, although what adventures exist can only be guessed at.

Festering Pool~
The foul stench prevalent throughout the pit becomes almost unbearable,
the source of the noxious odors rising from a rancid pool of water
collected in a depression in the cavern floor.  Rainbow-colored splotches
of an oily substance float atop the greenish-gray water, constantly
shifting in color as it drifts in oblong patches.  Tiny pieces of food
bob up and down, even the starving slaves unwilling to consume the rotten
morsels.

Slave Pit~
Slightly obscured from view, this nook has been chipped from the solid
rock just south of a rancid pool by years of slave labor.  Pockets of
minerals can be glimpsed along the walls, although any possessing
substantial value have already been removed and carted away.  A ragged
hole is visible in the southern wall, partially obscured by a cluster of
stones stacked in front of its opening.

Mostly obscured by the inky blackness of the underground cavern, a
festering pool of water can be seen to the north.  The stench that rises
from the murky liquid is nauseating, assaulting the senses with every
breath.

pockets minerals walls~
Shallow pits have been chipped out of the walls, where minerals were
excavated during the cavern's creation.  What sort of valuable ores were
carried away can only be guessed at, as no trace remains of their
existence except the holes now left behind.
~
E
ragged hole 1 south~
Only a little wider than a foot in diameter, a hole has been chipped away
in the wall, leading to a cramped chamber on its other side.  Evidently
created by the slaves as a hiding place, its entrance has been partially
obscured by a cluster of stones.
~

Stacked upon one another in a seemingly random fashion, a pile of rocks
partially obscures the ragged hole in the wall, making it difficult to

Slave Pit~
The furthest corner from the masters' outposts, this portion of the
cavern apparently serves as the sleeping chamber for the overwrought
slaves.  The ground has been swept free of all rocks and debris, and
oblong patches are present where their weary bodies have cleared away the
dust.  The rotting corpse of a slave who died in his sleep lies on the
ground, left in place as a testament to those who resist the overlord
regime.

Completely free of the rocks and debris that lie scattered upon the
ground in other portions of the slave pit, this chamber is kept
relatively clean and dry.
~
E
oblong patches dust~
A light layer of dust coats the ground, collected over time from the
constant mining operations that occupy the slaves during their
imprisonment in this musty pit.  The dust is missing in some spots, long
oval patches cleared while the prisoners have slept.

E
rotting corpse slave~
This small corpse is rather far along the process of decomposition.  It
is crawling with maggots and other small bugs.  The decaying flesh seems
to be the source of the smell.

Slave Pit~
Crumbled rocks lie scattered upon the ground, completely slathered with a
layer of slimy algae.  A rusty pipe protrudes down from the ceiling, with
droplets of water falling from its jagged lip every few seconds.  Winding
across the ground in a ribbon-thin band, the water drags miniscule bits
of slime and silt as it trickles westward.  The chamber also continues to
the south, the ground there a little less slippery.

crumbled rocks slathered layer slimy algae~
Rocks leftover from the pit's excavation litter the ground, ranging from
pebble-size to fist-shaped stones.  An emerald-green coating of algae
coats the rocks, made extremely slick by the trickle of water flowing
through the chamber.

rusty pipe ceiling droplets jagged lip~
Jutting out at an angle, an iron pipe routes water into the slave pit
from elsewhere in the tunnel system.  Its lip has partially rusted away,
leaving a dangerously jagged edge.
~
E
ribbon-thin band water silt~
A narrow band of murky water trickles to the west, picking up dirt and
algae along its path.  Flowing into a nearby rancid pool, the droplets
falling from the rusty pipe are the only source of water for the
imprisoned slaves.

operations have evidently ceased.  Piles of rubble litter the chamber
floor, broken off in the pursuit of past mineral excavations.  The
irritable smell that drifts through the chamber grows stronger to the
south, where a slimy pool of rancid water has collected.

slim layer lime-green lichen walls~
Only a few hairs thick, a dark-green layer of lichen grows upon the sides
of the chamber.  The fuzzy strands poke out from the rocks, soaking up
the humidity from the air which is almost tangibly thick.
~
E
piles rubble floor~
Numerous rocks lie scattered up byon the chamber floor, strewn about when
this gaping cavern was mined out by slave labor.  Free of any valuable
minerals, the gray rock bits have yet to be cleaned up by the remaining
slaves.
~
E
slimy pool water 1 south~
Patches of some oily substance glisten atop a murky pool of water that
has collected to the south, the patterns of color constantly changing.
The stench that pours in from the rancid pool is extremely nauseating,
irritable to the senses.

Edge of the Slave Pit~
Rivulets of blood streak down the cliff to the south, still tacky to the
touch.  Various body parts lie in a pool of gore at the base of the wall,
the remains of slaves who have futily attempted to escape from the pit. 
The chamber opens up to the north, although what perils lie beyond is
difficult to tell through the inky blackness.

rivulets blood streak tacky cliff 1 south~
Covering the cliff in runny streaks, lines of blood remain wet and tacky
on the rock surface.  Evenly-spaced trails of fingers can be seen in the
gore, where slaves have attempted to claw their way to freedom.
~
E
various body parts pool blood remains~
Although most of the flesh and bones that float on top of the pool of
blood are unidentifiable, some defined body parts briefly bob to the
surface.  Cast down to the floor by the overlords above, the remains of
the slaves who have attempted to escapee, become a powerful symbol of
obedience to the prisoner population.

Hidden Cave~
Completely hidden from view save a tiny opening in the north wall, this
tiny cave has been mined out by the slaves as the starting point for a
future escape tunnel.  A small cache of supplies has been stacked in one
corner, containing scraps of food and other prized possessions secluded
from the overlords.

tiny opening wall 1 north~
Chipped away from the wall in such a way to make its edges unnoticable at

Barely big enough for an elf to squeeze through, it keeps the vicious
overlords from discovering their plans for escape.

Wrapped in strips of torn cloth, a bundle of supplies hidden by the
