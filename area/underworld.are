Jagged Fissure - Cleft in the Mountainside~
A narrow fissure that cuts into the mountain exposes itself to the
sunlight at a sharply oblique angle to the west.  The fissure is wide
enough here for a bear to pass through, but narrows quickly as it
progresses further east.  To the south, the fissure fractures into
another branch along which a variety of bones and skulls litter the way.

fissure~
A narrow fissure opens up to the west, letting just enough light in to
see by.  Its rocky edges are blunted, as if something brushed past them
many a time.  To the east, the fissure narrows further, making it more
difficult, but not impossible to continue that way.  Etched into the
fissure walls are some crude markings.

Bone-Strewn Passage~
Ghostly pale bones litter the floor of the passage, grimly warning
intruders of the menacing danger that dwells nearby.  A faint aroma of
decay clings to the walls, only occasionally relieved by a faint rush of
air whistling through the fissured opening to the north.

Musky Den~
The rock walls of the fissure smoothen as they come to an end in a
roughly circular den.  The musky smell of continuous habitation permeates
the dank air, along with the slightly odourous aroma of decay emanating
from the bones of freshly devoured meals.  To the north a faint sliver of
light pierces the otherwise dim passage that leads into the den.

Jagged Fissure - Winding Passage~
The fissure cleaving the mountainside sharply changes direction here,
finding a path that traces flawed weaknesses in the surrounding rock. 
It diminishes greatly to the north and collapses in height until an ogre
would have to stoop to continue in that direction.  To the west, a narrow
curtain of light streams into the fissure, given substance by a fine
layer of dust that hangs suspended in the air.

Jagged Fissure - Winding Passage~
The fissure becomes inreasingly cramped as it travels further into the
mountain to the east, forcing you to stoop now and then to avoid
overhanging clefts high in the fissure walls.  Pawed footprints pad their
way down the fissure in both directions, proliferating more to the west
where the floor becomes markedly dustier.

mingled with the warmer air nearer the rear of the cave to provide a
comfortable shelter.

Rocky Ledge - In the Highlands~
The crisp highland air allows the scenic vista that stretches out before
to be seen with crystal clarity for many leagues into the distance.  Far
to the northwest a shimmering lake rests nestled amongst the highland
hills, surrounded by a dense ring of conifers.  The ledge you stand upon
is found perhaps halfway up a rocky incline too steep to climb with ease. 
The ledge continues to the south, where lies the only apparent exit from
this narrow perch on the hillside - a roughly circular opening that leads
into a small cavern.

Reflecting the sky as easily as a mirror, it lies nestled amongst the

Jagged Fissure - Winding Passage~
The fissure closes in so tightly on either side it is a cramped struggle
to pass through.  To the north however, the fissure has successfully
penetrated an underground cavern enveloped in a gloomy and muffled
silence.  In the opposite direction the fissure broadens and the way
becomes less rocky.

An expansive cavern loses itself in the darkness beyond you, stretching

reliant on the myriad sounds that echo off the cavern walls.  A slender

One giant stalagmite rises out of the cavern floor directly north of you. 
Its knobbly point reaches futilely towards a crooked stalactite hanging
from the cavern's ceiling far above you.  From here you may pass through
the cavern to the west and south, but to the north and east a
conglomeration of stalagmites bars the way as effectively as the cavern

Crooked Tunnel~
Maintaining a crooked path that could be determined only by the whims of
nature, this eroded tunnel twists upon itself as it follows an old
waterway.  Although presently dry, you expect that it still flows when
the snowmelt cascades down every waterway available in the highlands.  To
the south, the tunnel opens into an expansive cavern.  Dangling from the
ceiling of the cavern are multitudes of sticky web; there ends disappear
high above in the obscurity of a darkness that appears to be caused by a
wide ledge.

Nestled between two large rocks lies a desiccated corpse enveloped in a

other parts of the tunnel, slightly obscuring the way to the north and

Tangled Weave~
Strands and filaments proliferate in this corner of the tunnel, and
hacking your way through only seems to result in miring yourself even
more inextricably within their tangled web.  To the east the weave of
webs seems to lessen, while to the south the tunnel follows the natural
watercourse.  Lost in the obscurity of darkness and web, it is possible
to discern what appears to be a narrow ledge running around the eastern
and southern walls.

Haunted Bend~
A prickly sensation tingles down the back of your neck as you sense a
watchful presence staring at you, eyes boring into the back of your head,
from the dark shadows in the tunnel.  The haphazard accumulation of
boulders and rocks that forms the walls and ceiling of this tunnel provide
numerous places for malevolent threats to lurk behind.  Adding to the
mysterious feeling, sticky weblike strands cling to many of the rocks,
giving this section of the tunnel a haunted feel.  Shrouded in the gloomy
darkness in the upper reaches of the cavern, a sizable ledge seems to run
the entire length of the northern and western walls; the webbing seems to
suddenly start from this height.

Irregular Tunnel~
Following an irregular path, the tunnel ducks its way back and forth to
the north and south.  The floor of the tunnel has been eroded by frequent
flooding, most likely due to the seasonal snowmelts from the highland
mountains.  Strands of a gossamer thin web straddle the tunnel to the
south, quickly obscuring the way beyond.

Shale-Covered Mountain Slope~
Treacherously blanketed in a loose covering of shale, the rocky slope is
continually buffeted by the cold highland winds that race through the gap
in the mountains to the northwest.  A slight depression, forming a dusty
bowl forms the only break in the sea of shale that continues up the
mountain.  Pawprints leave lingering impressions leading out of the bowl
to find an almost imperceptible path down the slope.

East of a Stalagmite Group~
A bumbling profusion of stalagmites grow in their slumbering fashion to
the west, blocking the way westward through the cavern completely.  The
spires are unclimbable, their surfaces slick with the moisture that
trickles from cracks in the cavern's roof above.  To the northeast, a
mountain of rubble lies heaped high and wide, encompassing a significant
portion of the cavern's floor.

Its not  very often you see an image that shatters the illusion of safety
provided by stone walls, yet here something has undeniably scoffed at the
strength of the mountain and rampantly caused havoc throughout this part
of the cavern.  Fragments of the cavern floor are strewn in a shifting
and somewhat unstable formation near the rupture, to venture closer to
the rupture would be hazardous in the least and also present you with a
difficult climb through the boulders.

Southeast of a Stalagmite Group~
Eastward and northward the cavern soars into the darkness, engulfing
your tiny light source in its all consuming maw.  Like a bat, your only
sense of the cavern in that direction is through the myriad of sounds
that come echoing to you from the unseen boundaries of the cavern that
lie beyond the veil of darkness.  To the west, a narrow path wedges its
way between the cavern wall and a conglomeration of stalagmites that lie
to the northwest.

An oft-frequented path forces its way into a narrow gap between the
stalagmite group and the cavern wall to the south.  The path underfoot is
well worn, with claw marks and padded footprints embedded in the
moistened dirt that continually fights against the encroaching sprawl of
the stalagmites threatening to close the gap.  Gossamer threads tangle
themselves haphazardly across the stalagmites.

Fractures rend the cavern floor here, creeping out imperturbably from a
massive rupture buried partially beneath a mountain of rubble to the
south.  Fractures are also becoming evident in the cavern wall to the
north, tracing their way along weaker lines in the limestone formations. 
To the east and west however, the cavern floor appears more stable, and
the natural state of things is as eternal as the mountain itself.

Moist underfoot, you find yourself trudging through fresh layers of guano. 
Unlike the gradual sedimentation that forms in most bat caves, the guano

niches immersed in the gloom that blankets the rest of the cavern.

Guano Sea~
Slicker than an ogre's drooling double chin, the fresh coating of guano
that smears everything here makes traversing this corner of the cavern
hazardous, at least to your pride if not physically should you fall.  To
the south the cavern floor becomes less slippery as it approaches a
tunnel that leads out of the cavern to the east.

Dwarven Tunnel~
Ill maintained, the tunnel grimly despairs at its present state whilst it
still retains a memory of its past strength.  The tunnel walls still
indomitably hold fast, yet cobwebbed niches and rusting sconces betray
its recently acquired dishevelled state.  To the south, the tunnel
continues, while to the west it enters a gloomy cavern.

Dwarven Tunnel~
Enormous limestone blocks frame the tunnel as its continues its way in a
north-south direction.  The paving underfoot is also cut from the same
limestone, and worn smooth from many years of use.  The paved passage
would pass on a feeling of strength and endurance if it were not for the
grubby goblin footprints that smear the blocks underfoot with a mixture
of guano and mud.

A runic archway encloses the tunnel walls to the south.  Its surface is
chipped and shattered, a broken relic to its former power.  Across the

gobbo fashion, that is to say no fashion at all.  Nonetheless, it appears

Shale-Covered Mountain Slope~
The continually shifting, treacherous sea of loose shale and shattered
granite covers the barren mountain slope here.  Travelling further up or
down the slope is a slow, precarious task.  Despite the bleakness of the
mountain slope however, the vista that stretches before you is at the
same time enchanting and humbling.  Although comparitively not as high up
as many of the forgotten paths through the Everwinter Mountains, the view
here stretches uninterrupted from horizon to horizon, giving you a clear
picture of the valleys to the south, and a crystalline lake nestled in
the highlands to the northwest.

lake crystalline~
Enshrouded in mists and encircled by a dense conifer forest, the highland
lake lies ringed on all sides by the dominating peaks of the Everwinter
Mountain Range.  The only break in the mountains is via a narrow pass
that connects the southern edge of the lake with the valleys to the south.
~
E
pass mountain~
The pass weaves through the fringes of the mountain range where it
appears to follow an ancient, partially ruined roadway.  Nowhere is this
more evident, then at its southern end as it approaches the valleys
beyond.  At this point a landslide has carved away the mountains on
either side, smothering the pass completely.

Highland Ledge~
A smooth slab has wedged itself firmly into the mountainside here,
providing the only firm footing on the continually shifting bed of shale
that is now laced with a sheet of ice and snow.  Hanging over the slab,
an icy maw rimmed with frost opens into the mountainside.  The mountain
however, climbs ever upwards until its snowy peaks are lost somewhere as
they merge with an everpresent canopy of clouds that blankets the
Everwinter Mountains.  However, the treacherous slope of shale only
becomes increasingly dangerous, and such a climb would be nigh on
impossible.

Nevertheless, there is no distinct evidence that this is so, and you can

it slices into the cave's interior.

Giant fingers of glacial ice yawn over the cavern's opening which looks

Peaks stretch across the horizon guarding the world from whatever

mountain to the north, a trail interrupts the smooth sheet of snow as it
heads towards a ruined keep that hangs on a precipice overlooking the
valley and lake to the northwest.

Encroaching Stillness~
A choking stillness grips the fringes of the tunnel in its grasp, as
though the sounds of life you can hear reaching you from a cavern
somewhere to the south had suddenly been terminated.  The south wall of
the rock face is liberally coated with a vibrant curtain of moss, so much
so that the rock face itself is entirely smothered beneath its billowing
sheaths.
~
[Guin] Ankheg needs an long_s and long_p.
[Guin] Probaby ought to fix that move moss code to not work while the mob is in the room.
[Guin] Also needs a weight.
[Guin] Reviewed.
[Yrna] Added a short extra for moss, feel free to expand
[Yrna] Ankheg's weight set, long s and p fixed
[Yrna] Acode fixed - you can't open south if ankheg is in the room now
[Yrna] Done.

Glacial Cave~
A thin layer of frosted ice covers the cave like the varnish on a
delicately preserved collage.  Gnawed at bones are partially preserved
from going rancid on the ice crusted floor that hides many trinkets and
treasures frozen in time within its glacial grasp.

treasures trinkets~
Prismatic reflections of light gleam through the thin layer of ice
covering the floor, betraying the locations of metallic trinkets and
belongings that once had a place in the world before their owner became a
hearty feast.  Little you see is of value, either crudely fashioned by
goblins, or the remnants of dwarven fashioned camping gear.

E
bones~
Partially coated by a layer of ice, the remaining flesh that has not been
torn off the bone has started to take on crystalline formations as the
frost freezes the last drops of blood and moisture that lie splattered
across the gnawed on limb.

Tubular Tunnel~
Jutting out from the cavern wall, this narrow ledge is shrouded in the
obscurity of darkness.  Not too far away from the ledge, a fine spray of
icy water falls to the cavern's floor below, a few droplets splattering
across the stone platform.  Small crystals have been embedded into
slender fissures in the rock face, the glimmering shards apparently stuck
fast in the dark grey stone.

crystals fissures shards~
It appears that many attempts have been made at removing the crystal
shards from their resting place, as the rock surface is marred with
scratches that do not look natural in origin.  What little can be seen of
the crystal appears to be sharply angular, the rough-hewn edges of this
violet coloured gem look as though they could easily slice through skin. 
It may be this attribute that has left the crystal lying unperturbed for
so long.
