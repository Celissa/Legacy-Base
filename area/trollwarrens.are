Soaring Darkness~
Great limestone spires seemingly hang in midair here, the light not
reaching far enough to reveal the ceiling of this chamber.  The floor of
the cavern is also buried from view, as water pools darkly about the
massive stalagmites reaching toward the roof of the cavern.  The meshing
of the jutting structures gives the cavern the look of a giant maw,
glistening teeth bared in a rictus of maniacal laughter.

Tunnel Into Darkness~
This tunnel slopes down to the north, heading into deeper blackness.  The
stone walls are fairly uniform, although there is a slight discoloration
on the west wall.  The hanging stalactites have all been broken about
fifteen feet from the ground, their blunt ends jutting forlornly into the
cavern.  Piles of rubble reveal that the stalagmites were not spared this
harsh treatment.

Tunnel into Darkness -- Down Slope~
The path of the shattered limestone leads through the cavern, with no
stone unmolested in this section of the path.  The slope of the
passageway becomes much steeper to the north, making it almost necessary
to use the walls for assistance.  The jagged stalactites hang broken
above the debris.

Three splotches of darkness against the cavern walls reveal three
passages for you to choose from.  The tunnel slopes upwards to the south,
and continues on in a more or less level fashion to the east and west. 
Fragments of limestone in varying sizes are pushed into uneven piles to
the sides of the cavern, making the traverse slightly less difficult.

Earthen Dance~
Strange bands of color thread through the limestone wall at this corner,
as if the forming sand were contaminated with a dark loam and a red clay. 
Curving hypnotically, these veins of color seem to tease the mind into
thinking the hand of a phantom painter worked his art upon these walls. 
The rubble from the destroyed cave formations show sections of the same
color pattern.
~
[Eventine] may want to restructure the paragraph to get players to look at the veins as an acode which could have some really cool disorienting affect.

Branching Corridor~
Jagged chunks of debris are strewn about the floor here, seemingly
without a thought to the arrangement other than to clear a path through
this cave.  Thrusting down from the ceiling are shattered stalactites,
the broken edges crying out in a wordless shout of outrage at the harsh
treatment they received at the hands of the trollish stonemasons.  The
darkness encroaches to the north, and continues on to the east and west,
as the cavern walls fade into a deeper blackness.

Sharply folding about a jutting limestone formation, the tunnel twists
around from the south to the west.  There are ripples in the corner piece
of the limestone, as if it were formed by the slow merging of many
stalagmites and stalactites.  The rocks layered about the floor
seem to be pushed mostly out of the center of the corridor.

Condensation on every surface reflects the light and creates odd shadows
about the broken stalactites hanging from the ceiling.  Angular boulders
also create interesting figures upon the limestone wall with their
silhouettes flickering in the dull light.  A dark pool encircles the base
of a particularly large stump of the cave floor seemingly devours both the
dancing shadows and the light that caused them.

Branching Corridor~
Yawning darkness to the west reveals a passageway branching of the main
corridor here.  The gravelly path leads off into blackness to the north and
the south.  Scarred stalactites thrust down from the ceiling, their
broken stumps casting strange shadows on the east wall.

Silken Tendrils~
Thick, white, rope-like strands are woven about the jagged remains of the
spires hanging from the ceiling.  Tendrils hang from the network of
limestone and silk rope, the ends slick with white ooze.  The webs seem
to have been hacked apart to clear the passage, but more seem to have
remained stubbornly in the way.  Limestone and silk combine on the floor
to create a somewhat solid amalgam for an easier traverse than either
would surrender alone.

The cave spider's web extends across the top of the cavern.  Some strands
seem to be pulled too tightly, while others have unintended slack.  The
desctruction of the web caused many changes in the way it hangs from the
stalactites, but did nothing to diminish the sheer enormity of the work. 
The remains of the anchor cable are as thick as a man's wrist, and hang
broken and forlorn into the center of the room.

The cavern floor is hidden by a layer of black water, silently reflecting
the broken stalactites back at themselves.  Here and there a particularly
large piece of debris rises from the surface of the water, creating an
island of limestone.  The pool is not deep, and laps up against the walls
of the cavern, softly stirred by your passage.

Dominating this cavern is an enormous gate of rusted iron completely
blocking off passage to the west.  Crude bars extend the length and breadth
of the cavern to the west, creating a cage-like area beyond.  The smell
of blood lingers in the air, mixed with that of fear and death.  The
rubble of the cavern's natural formations lies strewn about the floor,
stained with dried blood.

creating an impassable barrier.  Passing into the darkness beyond, the

Hall of the Chieftess~
Torches set into crude iron sconces give off flickering light that
penetrates the darkness concealing the ceiling.  More of a natural
formation of the cave floor than an actual construction, a crude throne
stands commandingly alone in the center of the cavern.  The limestone
pillars are strangely unmolested in this cavern, and stand a silent watch
over any who enter.  The torch light flickers oddly on the west wall,
revealing that the limestone is a different color than the surrounding
walls.

The water here is about three feet deep, if such a viscous, rank slag
could be termed water.  The stench of the foul bilge gives the air an
oppressive solidity.  Offal falling into the pit from above sends dark

rank, filthy froth to ride the crests of the black waves.

Crimson-stained Cavern~
This cavern is enormous, roughly circular in shape, and has remnants of
many previous occupants strewn about the interior.  Dark red splotches
stain the limestone floor, while tufts of fur and hair poke out from
under debris along the perimeter.  There are a few sets of crude manacles
attached to the walls, the cuffs currently dangling unused.

Hollowed-Out Niche~
Hidden within the cave itself, this tiny room shows almost no signs of
how it was constructed; the walls are smooth and regular, perhaps too
smooth to be naturally formed.  The entire niche is bare, with only a
thin layer of dust on the smooth stone floor.  The air has a slightly
musty smell, giving the impression that this room had not been opened in
many many years.  On the east wall, near where you came in, is a slightly
odd looking stone.

A fine covering of dust rests undisturbed on the floor of the cavern,
save for the marks left by your passing.
