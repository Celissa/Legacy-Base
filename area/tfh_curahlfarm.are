A Quaint Country Road~
A narrow road, formed of dirt and gravel, leads the way to a large wooden
structure visible in the distance to the north.  The two-story building
seems to be well maintained, and looks very inviting.  Various styles of
fencing surround fields filled with livestock around the house on all
sides.  To the south, the gravel road gradually thins out into the open
countryside away from the farm.

The house on the horizon to the north has been built two stories tall,
and is primarily made of wood.  The wooden planks covering the outside of
the house appear somewhat old and worn, and have been stained a dark
brown color.  Large planters have been built below open windows that
flank a large oak door that faces southward, with a gravel road running
from the house to this spot.

A Quaint Country Road~
A narrow lane of pale gray gravel winds its way through the countryside
To the north is a large two-story farmhouse, its wooden exterior faded
and worn.  The gravel path also continues to the south, leading away from
the farm.  Fenced-in fields of various animals surround the farmhouse,
though the entryway into these pens is not visible from here.  Rows of
pretty purple flowers line the sides of this small country road,
well-tended and neatly pruned.

Mid-sized fields lie to the east and west of this gravel path.  Animals
are visible, grazing and mulling about behind fences erected around the
fields.  There is no obvious means of getting into the pens from here,

located.

A Quaint Country Road~
A large, two-story country home dominates the view to the north.  Its
faded, yet well-maintained, exterior has been darkly stained with some
natural wooden color, and small designs of animals and farm tools are
painted around the door frame and windows.  This lane is comprised of
small bits of grayish gravel mixed in with dirt, hardpacked into a sturdy
road, although small clumps of weeds and grasses poke up through the dirt
at odd intervals.  The lane also continues off to the south, leading away
from the farmhouse.  A tiny birdhouse rests on top of a ten foot tall
wooden pole, banded together next to the fence to the west.

A ten foot high wooden pole has been stuck into the ground and then
lashed to a fencepost for extra stability.  On top of the pole, a
birdhouse has been built of thin wooden sheets and trimming.  A wide dish
of seeds has been placed on a ledge next to the house, and a small cup
contains sugary water.  Small birds fly to and from the birdhouse on
a regular basis, taking advantage of the hospitality left for them.

A Quaint Country Road~
Large fields of farm animals surround the country house to the north. 
Each field has been enclosed by fencing in order to keep the various
livestock contained.  A pen to the east is fenced in by a flimsy
arrangement of hemp strings woven together in a random pattern, just
tight enough to keep the chickens within, and a muddy pen surrounded by a
wooden fence is visible to the west.  Gates to these pens are visible to
the northeast and northwest, up next to the house.  The country road that
leads up to the farmhouse runs north and south here, lined with small
flowers that give the narrow road a very quaint look.

An odd assortment of thin metal rings have been woven together to create
a unique fence that allows people to easily see the field and animals
within, yet is sturdy enough to keep the chickens from escaping.  Within
the fence are a number of chickens, and a chicken coop.  The metal fence

A huge expanse of mud is enclosed by a short wooden fence to the west.

Before a Large Farmhouse~
A dense layer of dirt and gravel leads up to a large farmhouse to the
north.  The outside of the house is covered with old, weathered wooden
boards, and stained with some sort of oily material, turning it a deep
brown color.  A narrow set of steps rises up to the front door of the
house, a sturdy plank of solid oak.  Sprawling animal pens surround the
farmhouse, with a variety of livestock visible through the gaps in the
fencing that keeps the livestock within.  The gravel pathway extends
around the house to the west and east, while a thicker bed of rocks leads
away from the house to the south.

This tall farmhouse looks very old, but has weathered time relatively
well.  Thick beams of solid oak frame the building, and wooden planks
have been hung between the framework to provide a weatherproof exterior. 
All of the wood has been treated with an unknown oily substance, making
it somewhat waterproof.  A sturdy oak door provides entry into the
house, flanked by two large yet very plain windows.

A thick plank of sturdy oak, this door has been stained with the same

Outside a Large Farmhouse~
A narrow gravel pathway runs between a large farmhouse to the north, and
a fenced-in field to the south.  A big wooden box has been nailed to the
side of the wall, just below an open window.  The narrow rectangular box
is filled with dirt, and a variety of delicate flowers have been planted
in the fine soil.  The gravel pathway leads off to the west around the
side of the house, and to the east where the front door of the farmhouse
is visible.  A short wooden gate leads into a muddy field to the south.

Outside a Large Farmhouse~
A shallow path of gravel laid on top of dirt winds its way east and west,
between a two-story farmhouse to the north and a fenced-in bare field to
the south.  The fence is constructed of thin hemp strands loosely woven
together to form an inexpensive see-through barrier that hangs between
log posts, with a plain wooden gate hanging on a set of rusty old hinges
that allows access into the pen.  A shallow planter is filled with tiny,
yet bright flowers below an open window six feet above the ground.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A short wooden fence has been erected to the north and east, enclosing a
large field of mud.  The wet, sticky dirt runs about six inches deep, and
scores of hoofprints are imprinted in the viscous substance.  A wooden
gate reinforced with cross slats hangs between two of the thicker
support posts, allowing farmhands access into this large pig sty.  More
mud and water are visible to the west and south, with the only dry land to
be seen existing on the other side of the gate.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A deep slough mires everything here like quicksand.  A short wooden fence
has been erected to the north to keep the livestock inside of this sloppy
holding area.  Mud is splattered all over the fence, and long streaks of
dry dirt are visible there, where pigs have rubbed across its planks. 
More of the sludgy mud can be seen in all directions except on the other
side of the fence, although it seems to get deeper in the center of the
pit to the south.

The Middle of a Livestock Holding Pen~
Thick, sloppy mud runs about nine inches deep across the middle section
of a muddy livestock pen.  A half-dozen or more indentations have been
gouged into the ground, where pigs have squirmed and rolled in the thick,
wet substance.  A musty odor rises from the oozing dirt; evidently the
pen has not been cleaned out in some time.  More mud is visible in all
directions, although this is the deepest part of the pig sty.  A low
wooden fence in the distance encloses all sides of this pit, broken only
by a narrow gate visible off to the northeast.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
The thick layer of mud that covers most of this field thins out towards
the eastern side of the pit here, where a wide trough has been built
against a short wooden fence.  The trough is not very tall, and seems to
be made of some water-resistant wood.  A layer of water and slops fills
the trough, its disgusting scent wafting through the air, assaulting the
senses.  The trough appears to have been built on this side of the pit so
that the farmhands could dump the slops over the edge of the fence,
avoiding getting muddy in the process.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Extreme amounts of water and loose dirt have formed into a heavy layer of
sticky mud, covering the hardpacked ground in this section of the pig sty. 
A low wooden fence to the south has been erected to the south, apparently
to just keep the animals from escaping the farm, as it does little to
contain the layer of mud from seeping out.  The top of a heavy leather
boot pokes out of the mud here, left from a careless someone, whose foot
apparently became stuck in the quicksand-like muck.  The field of mud
runs on to the east and west, deepening in the center of the sty to the
north.

The top of a heavy leather boot pokes up from the mud, the rest of the

appears as if the boot may never be removed unless someone does a lot of
digging.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Two sections of short wooden fence join together in the southwest corner
of this livestock pen, held together by lengths of stout cord and
tight-fitting pegs to keep it from falling apart.  Splotches of mud dot
the fence where pigs have shaken themselves off, making a spotted effect
resembling a leopard's skin.  The muddy pit continues along the fence to
the north and east, and the center of the sloppy sty is visible just to
the northeast.  Open fields to the south and west seem oblivious to the
rampant slovenliness of the dank pit on this side of the small fence.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Mud is splattered all over a three-foot tall wooden fence that protects
the pigs from escaping the holding pen to the east and south.  In the
corner of the pit where the fence meets, thick loops of rope are knotted
to hold the two sections of fence together in a somewhat secure fashion. 
A wide wooden trough has been built up against the fence, filled with
leftover rotting food and water.  The trough appears to have been built
up against the fence so that whoever would be filling it would not have
to walk through the mud.  The muddy pit also exists to the north and
west, with only open countryside visible over the fence to the south, and
a narrow gravel road on the other side of the fence to the east.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A wide open field is visible on the other side of a low wooden fence that
has been built on the west side of this pit.  The vibrant, dry field is a
stark contrast to the wet, sticky brown mud that covers the ground in a
thick, sloppy layer.  Numerous tracks crisscross the mud in a random
pattern of travel, with deep ruts where pigs must have rolled lazily in
the cool, wet muck.  The muddy pit is somewhat shallow to the north and
south, yet gets deeper when travelling to the center of the pig sty to
the east.

A short wooden fence encloses this shallow pit of mud to the north and
west, erected to keep the animals within the muddy enclosure.  The mud
here is somewhat congealed and drier than the rest of the mud in the sty,
sticking to everything in heavy clumps.  Innumerable small hoofprints
have almost fossilized in the drying muck, with tracks leading off to the
east and south into yet more of the oozing sludge.  An open field is
visible on the other side of the fence to the west, while another
livestock area is visible further to the north.

west north short wooden fence~
A three-foot high fence of wooden beams has been built in order to keep
the pigs from leaving their messy pen.  Each beam is about four inches
wide and two inches thick, and are nailed together with crude, rusty iron
nails.  The wooden fence is covered in streaks of mud where pigs have
rubbed against it.

down mud pit shallow~
Great amounts of water has been added to the dirt in this field to create
a six-inch deep bog of mud.  The mud has many hoofprints and gouges in it
from pigs rolling around in the wet, sticky substance to keep cool.  Bits
of mud cling to everything that comes in contact with it.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Thick, wooden poles stand six feet apart, with some type of loose hemp
netting strung between them to prevent the livestock from escaping. 
Ragged tufts of grass grow sporadically, as the animals in this pen have
slowly eaten the foliage in small clumps.  A wide gate has been built
between two posts to the north to allow the farmers to get in and out of
the enclosure.  The holding pen stretches to the south and east, while
the the main farmhouse is located to the northwest.  A weathered shack,
centered on the back fence, serves as a coop for roosting chickens.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Countless animal tracks pepper the ground here.  What might once have
been a lush, green field has been reduced to a dusty patch of crabgrass,
the half-score of resident rabbits leaving nothing much more than gnawed
stems.  Sturdy wooden poles support a hemp net stretched between them to
the west, preventing the animals from leaving their protective enclosure. 
The dirt covered field stretches out in all directions but west, and a
gate leading from the pen is visible off to the north.  A ramshackle
building to the east appears to be a hastily-erected chicken coop, with a
narrow doorway constructed to allow the chickens access to its interior.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
This section of the holding pen if relatively free of the ravaging
drought present in other portions of the field.  The bottom half of an
old barrel rests here, its intact half filled with water for the
livestock.  The surrounding ground and grass is soaked by spillage from
the short wooden tub, creating a muddy, track-crossed morass.  An aging
chicken coop constructed from faded, weathered wood stands to the
northeast, a haven where the chickens can shelter from bad weather and
cold nights.  Thick upright posts, spanned by some sort of netting stand
to the south and east, preventing the animals from escaping into the
countryside.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A netting of sturdy fibers spans the distance between two narrow posts
to the north, built in order to keep the animals within the pen.  What
was once a lush, green field has been reduced to dry dust, with only
sparse clumps of grass remaining.  Animals have chewed their way through
almost all of the vegetation here.  A modest chicken coop lies southward, a
low-rising ramp leading upward to a narrow door cut into the wall, its
only means of access.  Patches of open pasture are visible to the east
and west.

This confined wooden shack is built in the middle of a small field,
penned in by a sturdy fence.  A score of wide shelves line the walls,
littered with hay molded into nests by the chickens that live here.  The
air is filled with a rotting stench, and the floor is covered with a thin
layer of chicken droppings.  Narrow ramps lead down to the dusty field in
all directions, small slats nailed into the boards providing some
traction from the slippery surface.

Dust blows up in small swirls from the parched ground, obscuring much of
the view of this portion of the pen.  The chickens who live here have
pecked at the ground so much that very little grass remains.  The open
countryside to the south is barely visible, the dust and a tall fence of
hemp netting is blocking the line of sight.  A narrow ramp of wood
leads up to a chicken coop to the north, a small hole sawed out of the
wood allowing the chickens to enter and exit freely.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Stringy strands of hemp fibers have been woven into a loose netting that
has been stretched along three wooden posts driven into the ground to
form a makeshift fence.  The fence runs along the north and east side of
the pen here, lashed together sparsely with thin metal rings where the
two sides meet.  A low, faded wooden trough has been built just inside
the fence in the corner, apparently one of the sources of food for the
animals.  The dry field within the fence continues to the west and south. 
A shack that houses the chickens held here lies to the southwest.

more than adequate for keeping the chickens from leaving.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Lush, green grass has been reduced to mere patches of scraggly foliage by
the animals of this pen.  Various small tracks are evident in the dirt,
and quite a bit of dust has been kicked up from the dry ground.  A wooden
post supports an odd-looking arrangement of dried greenish-brown fibers
woven into inexpensive netting that protects the pen's occupants from
invaders.  The remainder of the parched field continues to the north and
south, and a short wooden board, covered with wooden slats, gently leads
up to a small opening cut into a chicken coop to the west.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A sturdy tree trunk supports a wide fence made of woven hemp fibers that
blocks passage to the south and east in this corner of the livestock pen. 
Ragged tufts of short grass are interspersed along the otherwise dry,
dusty ground, many hungry animals taking their toll on the landscape. 
The field stretches off to the north and west, and an aging chicken coop
is visible to the northwest.

Outside a Large Farmhouse~
A narrow gravel pathway leads around a large farmhouse, turning a corner
here to run both north and east.  Mid-sized fields of livestock are
visible off to the west and south, though fencing surrounding the pens
prevents entry to them from here.  The large farmhouse has withered old
wooden boards nailed to its exterior, though the wooden planks have been
treated with some sort of dark oily substance to prevent further aging.

A shallow lane of pale gray rock and dirt winds its way around a tall
wooden structure to the northwest.  The rather ordinary path leads off to
the west and north between the building and two fenced-in fields of
livestock to the east and south.  The pen to the east is surrounded by a
stone wall, while the field to the south is enclosed by a fence of woven
hemp strands.  Large rocks line the side of the path to prevent traffic
from shuffling the gravel into the fields.

A sturdy wall of stone blocks encircles a field of straw and grass to the
east, that looks to be a cattle run.  A heavy gate of wooden logs stands
between two sturdier poles so that people can still access the field.  A
two-story structure looms to the west, the wooden planks covering its
exterior slightly warped and faded from neglect on the leeward side of
the building.  A narrow gravel path leads off to the north a short way
toward a tall wooden fence, and also to the south toward more livestock
pens.

A gravel path, leading from the south, dead-ends here at a tall wall
erected to prevent passers-by from raiding the ample vegetable garden
apparent through knotholes in the wood.  An intricate cobweb spans the
distance between the framhouse and the fence nearly at ground level, and
bits of leftover straw and grass from the nearby pens nestle against the
wooden planks.  A stone wall stands as a crude yet functional restraint
for the cows which live in the field to the east, although no entrance
into the field is apparent from here.

A rickety old gate made of wood hangs on rusty hinges to the west, the
only visible entryway into a modest-sized field of sheep.  Wooden posts
driven into the ground hold up the ancient-looking gate, as the vertical
slats of thin wood that comprise the remainder of a fence surrounding the
field would not support its weight.  A spacious farmhouse is present to the
east, its withered, rustic exterior needing a touch of maintenance as
well.  A narrow gravel pathway runs north and south here between the
farmhouse and the fenced-in pen.

A narrow pathway runs beside the farmside, coming to an end at a tall
wooden fence that lies to the north.  The fence, approximately eight feet
in height, forms a near-solid wall of vertical slats that completely
obscures the view ahead, and that would be difficult, at best, to climb. 
A shorter fence of those same vertical slats encircles a mid-sized field
of sheep on the west, with a gate visible just a short distance to the

Main Entryway~
The inside of this farmhouse is a stark contrast to its exterior.  The
walls inside are painted in vibrant natural colors, with an assortment of
hand-wrought drawings of animals and farm tools painted in an even
pattern in more subtle shades.  Narrow shelves flank the home's sturdy
oak door to the south, filled with knick-knacks and curios carefully
placed for all to see.

Narrow, three-foot long wooden shelves have been built into the wall to

Unlike the bland, weatherbeaten wooden planks that cover the exterior of

and farm tools patterned in various natural shades of green on top.

Inside a Large Farmhouse~
Rotund barrels of ale stand in the southeast corner of what must be the
farmhouse's larder.  Tall cabinets are stacked to the top with an
abundance of sealed jars filled with a variety of food, while big piles
of dried, spiced meat lie curing on palettes on the floor.  The smell of
fresh cooking wafts in from the kitchen to the north, and fresh country
air drifts in from the open window between the cabinets on the south wall.

The Kitchen~
A huge black iron woodstove occupies the entire east wall of this kitchen
area.  Various pots of food are bubbling above the stove, dangling below
pothooks above the open fire.  A huge rack of beef sizzles on a thick
metal spit, its fatty drippings falling into the flame with a spattering
hiss.  Tall wooden cabinets are filled to capacity with jars of various
herbs and spices, and a long counter is covered with fresh-picked fruits
and vegetables from the kitchen garden behind the farmhouse, which is
visible through a large, open window.

An immense firepit made of huge plates of solid iron and painted black,
this stove looks like it could cook enough food to feed an army.  A wide
hinged door on the front allows the remnants within the pit to be
discarded, and access for the fire to be stoked.  Pothooks protrude
horizontally above the open box, allowing pots to be hung above the open
flame.  A heavy iron spit rotates slowly above one portion of the stove,
with a full side of beef speared and sizzling in the heat.

A large side of beef, freshly slaughtered, sizzles above an open flame

to permeate the house.

Inside a Large Farmhouse~
A long, wide wooden dining table takes up most of the space in this room. 
The table is huge, and looks like it could seat twenty people if
necessary.  Its surface is polished, though countless scratches and
gouges indicate the table has been used quite often.  A number of fruit
baskets are placed in the center of the table, filled with a fresh
selection from the orchards behind the farmhouse.  A stairwell to the
second floor is visible to the west, and the front door of the farmhouse
can be seen to the south.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Fist-sized rocks stuck together with generous portions of mortar have
been built up into a crude but respectably sturdy wall to keep the
powerful animals contained within the mid-sized field that is their home. 
A primitive gate of wooden logs hangs on rusty metal hinges that barely
support such a heavy weight.  The dry, dusty ground is blanketed by a
thin layer of straw, trampled and strewn about by the constant traffic of
man and beast.  The enclosure is bordered by the fence to the north and
south, and extends eastward where more open ground is visible.

The Middle of a Livestock Holding Pen~
Thick bales of straw are piled up in the center of enclosure, evidently
stored here as a long-term source of food for the animals in the
fenced-in area.  Clumps of hay have been torn out of the bales by hungry
cows, and strewn around the entire field by the hungry creatures.  A
shoddily constructed wall of dense rocks surrounds the field in an
attempt to prevent the animals from stampeding the rest of the farm.  A
dilapidated gate has been built off to the west to allow the farmhands
access into the pen.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Thick clumps of old straw litter the ground, passed over for consumption
by the animals that live in this field.  A haystack rises in the center
of the field, and a tall farmhouse can be seen behind the pile in the
distance.  Heavy boulders of varying shades of gray have been piled up on
top of each other to create a sturdy wall, preventing the farm's
livestock from walking away.  The open field parallels the wall to the
north and south.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Numerous rocks of all sorts of shapes and sizes have been hastily
converted into a basic wall, held together with generous amounts of
mortar.  The wall stands four feet high and two feet dense, though
oddly-shaped rocks jut out at various points from the sides.  Open fields
of wheat are visible on the other side of the shoddy construction, with
waves of grain shifting in the lazy wind.  This holding pen opens up to
the north and west, with a large wooden farmhouse visible off in the
distance.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Riddled with divots of clods of dirt and grass, this section of the field
shows the constant traffic of the pen's occupants.  A two-foot wide wall
of gray rocks, stacked upon each other and held together with a thick
slathering of mortar protects the animals from walking away from the farm
to the north and east.  The dusty field continues on to the west and
south, with a large farmhouse visible in the distance to the west.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Large gouges have been dug into the hardpacked dirt, evidently a large
bovine animal has taken some frustration out on something here.  To the
south, a stone wall three feet thick and five feet high has been built to
prevent the animals within the pen from escaping.  The enclosure runs
alongside the fence to the east and west, and opens up into a clear area
to the north, where a tall pile of straw has been placed.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A large L-shaped wall of crumbling rocks has been built in the southwest
corner of this field in a shoddy attempt to prevent the cows from
escaping.  The dense wall runs to the north and east, spreading out into
the distance.  Large mounds of straw dot the otherwise bland ground,
leftover from cows slowly eating through a stack of hay bales to the the
northeast.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Dusky gray boulders have been stacked up along the northern edge of this
field, creating a crude wall of stone.  Clumps of straw are strewn among
the ground, apparently the food source for the cows that reside in this
holding pen.  Open countryside is visible to the north, with lush fields
of wheat and other grains that sway in the wind.  This enclosure
continues to the west, east, and south.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A thick wall of heavy rocks has been constructed around the perimeter of
this livestock pen, their smooth surfaces fitting together well enough to
create a sturdy barrier for the cows that live within this field. 
Patches of grass poke up through a thin layer of straw that blankets the
ground of this holding pen, keeping the area dry and relatively odor-free. 
The enclosure along the fence to the east, and a large gate is visible
just off to the south.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
This large, grassy field is surrounded by a short, hand-crafted wooden
fence.  The fence is approximately three feet tall, and is made from
countless narrow wooden boards nailed tightly together side by side.  A
rickety old gate of mismatched boards hangs on rusty hinges between two
rough-cut posts to the east, allowing access to this small field and
preventing the animals from escaping.  The field continues to parallel
the fence to the north and south, and opens up into a clearing to the
west.

of wooden planks surrounds the field on all sides, keeping the animals
which reside within the pen safe from predators.  A gate from the

This open field stops short at a wooden fence standing to the west,
blocking passage to the open countryside beyond.  The field continues to
the north and south along the fence, but opens up again to the east,
where a gate in the fence is visible at a distance.  Patterns of various
tracks can be seen in the dirt, left by the livestock constantly foraging
for the sparse food remaining here.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A short wooden fence is all that separates this dusty field from open
wheat fields and countryside to the west and north.  The fence is made of
wooden planks placed tightly side by side so the farm's sheep cannot
meander too far away from the farmhouse.  The field opens up to the
south and east, where the large farmhouse is visible in the distance.

short wooden fence planks~
This short fence has been set up so that none of the sheep within the pen
can escape, and also keeps predators away from the lambs.  It has been
constructed of three foot high planks of wood, tapered to a point at the
top, and driven into the ground side by side.  No gaps exist between the
planks, except where the natural warping of the wood provides peepholes
to the countryside beyond.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
Three foot tall planks of wood have been placed in the ground side by
side, creating a makeshift fence to the north.  The wooden strips are
painted white, though the whitewash color has faded and has flaked off in
spots.  A large garden is visible on the other side of the fence behind
the farmhouse to the east, and open countryside is visible to the
northwest.  A well-worn pair of metal shears hangs from an old hook on
the fence, used by the farmhands to shear wool from the shaggy sheep.

A simple set of metal shears hangs from a hook imbedded in a stout fence

attached to a sturdy post that helps support the fence.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A short fence of vertical wooden planks has been built around the
perimeter of a mid-sized grassy field in order to protect livestock
within the makeshift pen from predators.  The ground is comprised of dry,
dust-producing fine dirt, as most of the grass which once grew here has
been grazed away by the animals.  The field runs to the south and west,
and a gate leading from the pen is visible to the south.

A Livestock Holding Pen~
A short fence prevents movement to the south from here, with vertical
planks tightly placed side by side with no gaps between them.  Clumps of
grass and weeds lay on top of hardpacked dirt from the animals constantly
scrounging for food.  Another pen of animals can be seen on the other
side of the fence, though there appears to be no direct gate between the
two pens.

A three-foot tall fence of boards has been erected here to make sure that
no animals can escape the farm's confines.  Tightly bound planks been
driven into the ground side by side, with no gaps between the boards
except those caused by the natural warping of weathered wood.  Very
little grass remains in this otherwise dusty area, the sheep who reside
in this pen have eaten most of what used to grow here.  A large farmhouse
is visible to the east on the other side of the fence, and the field
stretches off to the north and west.

The eastern half of this long bedroom has been converted into an office

the one wall, with scraps of paper and notes stacked neatly on its
surface.  Small paintings of his family flank a wooden abacus, and large
boards attached to the wall describe levels of livestock, feed supplies,
and weather cycles.  A chair built from thick pieces of wood and expertly
tanned hides provides comfortable seating when working.  A simple wooden
door to the north leads into the upstairs hallway, and the remainder of

A quick glance at the papers in the man's hands is all that is available,
as he glares at you for reading over his shoulder, curling the papers so
only he can read them.  Before they are covered up, you see carefully
itemized lists of all of the farm's stock on hand.

The Master's Chamber~
An ample handwoven rug of thick wool, dyed with a brilliant pattern of
colors, covers the majority of the hardwood floor in the master bedroom of
the farmhouse's owners.  An oak desk sits against the wall to the south,
and a pair of nightstands holding lanterns flank a tall four-poster bed
against the west wall.  Thick velvet curtains cover a murky glass
window facing south, overlooking all of the livestock pens below.  A
makeshift office for the owner lies to the east, the only way out of the
bedroom.

large handwoven rug wool dyed brilliant pattern floor~
A large blanket, twenty feet by twenty feet, almost manages to cover the
entire hardwood floor.  Roughly crafted by hand, each hook and loop is
plainly visible, and provides excellent cushioning underfoot.  Various
dyes have been used to create a brilliant moire pattern of color
emanating from the center of the rug.
~
E
oak desk south~
A rough yet sturdy oak desk sits against the southern wall.  Its surface
has been stained deep brown, and then highly polished.  Not a single
speck of dust rests on its surface, testament to the cleaning prowess
of the farmhouse's servants.  A single keyhole has been carved in the wood
near the top of the desk where a cleverly designed, hinged door protects
the contents inside.
~
E
nightstand lantern flank~
Wooden nightstands the same height as the bed's mattress flank both sides
of the exquisite four-poster bed on the west wall.  Each nightstand has a
brass-plated lantern sitting atop it, though both are unlit.
~
E
four-poster bed west mattress~
Four ornate beams rise from the intricate frame of an obsidian-colored
wooden bed.  A fluffy mattress of feathers and wool rests on top of the
frame, and looks very comfortable.  The bed is made with extreme
precision with a finely-sewn hide blanket.
~
E
thick velvet curtains murky glass window~
Heavy velvet curtains have been draped in front of a murky glass window
that overlooks the front half of the farm below.  Each curtain is pulled
back from the window and drawn tight with a soft yellow rope.  Though its
surface is clean, the cheap glass has many imperfections and distorts the
view of the fenced-in pens.

A Small Bedroom~
Homey patterns of diminutive white ducks and over-fed chickens decorate
the walls of this small child's room.  An empty baby's cradle and other
infant items are stacked in one corner of the room, either unused or
already finished in their purpose.  A narrow bed is shoved into the
opposite corner of the room, its mattress faded and dull from age. 
Hand-carved wooden trim encircles an oaken door, leading to a hallway
which runs between rooms on the upstairs floor of the farmhouse.

The walls of this room have been painted with a patterned series of small
white ducks and plump yellow chickens from floor to ceiling.  The colors
of the diminutive pictorals have faded, and most of the symbols nearer to

baby cradle infant items~
Covered with a light coating of dust, this wooden baby cradle sits long
unused in one corner of the room, along with crates of infant toys.  Many
of the crates have been broken open, as unruly visitors to the friendly
farm have already rummaged through what little remains.

E
hand-carved wooden trim~
The supportive frame of the doorway has intricate cariactures of cows
jumping over moons and sheep leaping over tiny fences up and down its
sides.  Small notches have been cut into the wooden frames at random
heights up to four feet, with small numbers from one to twelve inscribed
next to the cuts.

E
narrow bed mattress~
A bed only a small child or a pint-sized gnome would love, it has doweled
rails six inches high that connect to a horizontal crossmember, to keep
whoever might sleep within the bed from rolling off its edge.  It is
covered in dust, though patches of dust have been stirred up in messy
handprint shapes.

The Attic~
A simple storage room has been built at the very top of the farmhouse, a
place to store old family treasures.  A musty smell permeates the small
area from the rustic items left in here for so long, and countless
cobwebs hang in the rafters.  Small octagonal windows, covered in dust
and grime, provide scant view of the livestock pens to the south, and the
large vegetable garden and open countryside below to the north.  Piles of
old clothing, curios, and memorabilia are carefully stored in the
corners, with extra chairs and dishes for the dining room carefully
stacked near the trapdoor, leading to the remainder of the house.
~
[Rikahn] Add a large wooden chest here, put something very simple inside
like a bolt of cloth, thread, needle, whatever.

Small octagonal windows, covered with metal mesh, provide a view of the

a large vegetable garden and tall wheat fields grow in solitary peace,
while to the south the animal pens and roadway leading up to the farm
stretch out into the distance.

Piles of old mementos lie next to each other around the perimeter of this
