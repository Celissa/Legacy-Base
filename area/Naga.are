Lush Jungle~
A tangled mass of vines and creepers loop down from the high canopy
overhead, causing passage in any direction to be a constant struggle. 
Tall trees tower skywards, rough red bark covered in tiny epiphytes,
branching out into an umbrella canopy at approximately one hundred feet. 
At the base of the mighty trees, a carpet of moss and ferns spread,
thriving in the filtered light that escapes through gaps overhead.  A few
large boulders, covered in moss, lie in a jumbled heap to the north.  To
the south the lush vegetation seems to be thinning.  In the low areas and
small depressions, brackish water gathers into pools, a swarming mass of
tiny insects dipping and diving amongst them.

To the north, the land rises upwards.  Although not a hard climb, it is
made more difficult by the tangled nature of the jungle.  A few large
boulders lie scatted in the way, blocking any view of what lies beyond.
~
E
vines creepers~
The vine tendrils cover the area in a tangled mass of looping and
encasing green.  Almost like a mass of giant serpents they spread out
across the landscape, exploring any nook and cranny for purchase.  Often
they completely smother the lower base of the tall trees and bury smaller
plants in their suffocating embrace.
~
E
trees~
Supported by a mass of thick roots, the tall trees dominated the skyline. 
Their towering trunks are rough and cracked, allowing fungi, moss and
epiphytes to grown on them.  The canopy their branches form blocks most
of the light from reaching the jungle floor.
~
E
l south~
The land drops downward and the ground looks to be increasingly boggy. 
From the south, the sounds of frogs and the drone of insects can be heard. 
The smell of decay fills the air, suggesting that a swampland lies
somewhere in that direction.
~
E
moss ferns~
Across the jungle floor spread the lush, damp carpet of yellow and green
mosses, covering everything in its path.  Out of it grow a countless
variety of ferns.  From the tiny maidenhair to larger tree ferns, they
dominate the lower strata of the jungle.
~
E
boulders~
Coated in a thin layer of moss and lichen, the boulders tumbled down to
rest here a long ago.  Several of the rocks are the size of an ogre,
while most are only halfling size.
~
E
fungi~
Supported by thick, woody stems, the fungi umbrella-shaped caps glint with
dew.  Growing amongst the cracks of bark and decaying vegetation, they
thrive in the damp darkness.
~
E
brackish water pools depressions~
The brackish pools offer the perfect environment for all manner of tiny
blood sucking insects to thrive.  The waters are thick with swimming larva
and the air around them filled with buzzing mosquitoes.

Lush Jungle~
Towering trees and lush undergrowth crowd together, struggling for light
and other resources.  Everywhere there is a proliferation of growth and
color.  Thick leafed plants send forth red and yellow flowers in an
attempt to attract the plentiful insect life.  Tangled masses of vines
and creepers envelop most of the large trees, their thick looping
tendrils reaching from the jungle canopy to the floor.  The calls of
hidden animals echo throughout the area, the chatter broken only when the
guttural call of a predator sounds.  Cascading from the high foliage is a
misty rain, which combines with the trapped heat of the jungle basin to
make breathing a laborious affair.  To the north a faint path leads into
the lush vegetation, quickly disappearing from view as the greenery swallows
it up.  Southward the jungle appears to be thinning, although still
densely packed.

Varying shades of green surround you, bathed in the pale glow of the
falling mist.  Gemlike drops of clear rain fall from the widespread
leaves, landing with muffled sounds on the lush undergrowth carpeting the
jungle floor.  The heavy perfumes of flowers fill the damp air with their
spice, creating a nearly-intoxicating combination when mixed with the
rich scent of growing plants and moist earth.  The plants themselves seem
full of vigor, high-arched stalks supporting wide-veined leaves and
clusters of waxy red and yellow flowers.

Lush Jungle - Overgrown Path~
Almost completely overgrown, the path through the dense jungle is hardly
better to travel along than the impenetrable foliage surrounding it. 
Vines and creepers lie half hidden, ready to trip up the unwary, sending
them spilling to the jungle floor.  Barely perceivable through the wide
growths are two rocky outcrops, strange in their symmetrical shape;
perhaps not as natural as first impressions would lead a viewer to
believe.  From the high foliage of the jungle canopy falls a damp cloud
of misty-rain, that finds its way under leaf and frond, eventually
reaching the leaf-littered jungle floor.  Overhead small animals scuttle
around, using the masses of vines as walkway.  Passage to the east and
west is blocked by the jungle, while the small path continues its winding
journey northward and southward through the deep jungle.

path~
Winding its way through the jungle, the path is little more than a muddy
stain across the leaf-littered floor.  Overgrown with tangled vines and
small shrubs, it is easy to lose sight of where it leads.  Along side the
path at several points are small trickling streams, fed by the constant
misty rain.
~
E
vines creepers~
Masses of vines and creepers loop down from the high canopy to the jungle
basin.  At the sides of the small path they almost form a wall, so dense
as to hinder movement off the path.  The occasional tendril snakes across
the trail, ready to trip up the unwary.

Lush Jungle - Small Clearing~
Without warning the jungle opens up into a small clearing.  Oddly, there
is very little growth here; thick leaf-litter covers most of the area,
and even this seems to be void of the normal shoot and ferns found
elsewhere.  Overhead the canopy spreads out, enshrouding the area in
shadows.  From the high branches of the jungle trees, a multitude of
entangling vines cascade downwards to nearly touch the ground.  The small
trail leads southward into the thick jungle and northward, where it
appears to end in a small clearing.

canopy~
Made from the entwined branches of countless trees, the high canopy is

Lush Jungle - White Stone Wall~
From out of the dense jungle rises a large crumbling wall.  Twisted vines
and abundant creepers have attempted to encase its white stones in a
thick green mantle.  Large broad-leafed plants and small ferns flourish
in the shadows of the wall.  Once the wall would have served as stout
protection, now however the rocks are being defeated by the green
onslaught of the jungle.  A large tree grows besides the wall, the gap
just wide enough to allow passage to the east.

Lush Jungle - Large Tree~
Here the wall has been grievously damaged by the growth of a large tree,
slumping to half its original height, and spilling rocks and debris as it
fell.  The masses of thick roots from the mighty tree have spread out
covering most of the fallen rocks from the wall with a spidery network. 
Seizing an opportunity, encroaching vines and dense shrubs have quickly
filled the area, racing to be the first to seek the filtered light.  In
the shadows of the larger plants, small ferns and damp moss flourish,
drinking in the water that tumbles from the canopy overhead.  The thick
jungle and unstable wall stop any further progress west.  It is possible,
however, to move over the rubble and head east into shadowy jungle.

Lush Jungle~
Almost completely encased in the rampant jungle growth, it is difficult
to see where plants end and the wall begins.  A few flashes of white
stone can just be seen through the green expanse.  Overhead the high
trees form an umbrella of branches, where small animals forage,
scampering from tree to tree without ever having to touch the ground. 
The jungle is filled with the sounds of birdcalls and the jabbering of
hidden creatures.  Underfoot, a carpet of thick moss thrives in the
filtered light and constant misty rain.  It appears possible to squeeze
past a large tree and continue westwards or head down a short incline
into a moss-covered clearing.

Lush Jungle - Small Clearing~
In the center of the clearing is a large tree stump, now almost
completely covered in moss and small white fungi.  There is no sign of
the tree itself, since by the look of the stump it was felled some time
ago.  Half-buried rows of cobbled stones can be seen poking out of the
green carpet at several locations, perhaps part of an ancient road. 
Encircling the clearing the jungle would probably prevent passage in most
directions.  It is possible, however, to head west up a moss-covered bank
or perhaps, force passage along the ancient road northward.

Ancient Road~
The narrow, overgrown road winds through the lush green jungle, heading
in a north-south direction.  Covering most of the cobbles is deep
leaf-litter and soft green moss.  The air is filled with bird calls and
the smell of damp and decay.  To the north, just visible through the
jungle, the road seems to end at a wall, a dark red circle cut in it,
perhaps a form of gate or tunnel.  Southward the road continues into
deeper jungle, quickly being swallowed from view.

road~
Made from tightly packed cobbles, the road has endured the encroachment
of the jungle surprisingly well.  Small patches of broken stones have
allowed the occasional tree fern to sprout, but mostly the road is clear
of large debris.  The ever-present moss carpets a large portion of the
stones, giving the road a patchwork look.
~
E
ferns~
Tall tree ferns combine with shorter palm ferns to form a wall of fronds,
which grow towards the light.  From under the lowest ferns spreads a
carpet of moss and white fungi.  A light misty rain falls constantly,
blanketing the area in a warm dampness.
~

moss fungi~
A deep blanket of green moss covers most of the area, blanketing the jungle

Before a Large Gate~
The ancient road ends at a large circular gate made from red wood
reinforced with strong iron bands.  Above the gate is a stone arch, its
keystone cut from black rock in striking contrast to the white stone used
to build the rest of the wall.  In much better condition here, the road
is clear of the normal moss and ferns that carpet it elsewhere. 
Stretching westward and eastward is a large, crumbling white stone wall,
mostly overgrown with vines and creepers.

The jungle has mostly reclaimed the cobbled courtyard that spreads out
before a large@n @rred-wood gate@n. This entire place has a feel of being
consumed by the green waves of verdant growth.  Lush vegetation
obscures the view in most directions, although it appears possible to

Jungle Ruins - Clearing~
From out of the cobbled path, several trees have sprouted, ripping
through the stonework with their prying roots.  Such is the devastation
wrought on the ruined buildings here that their purpose has become
unclear.  A few walls and rubble piles lie mostly buried in vines and
creepers, as the jungle quickly erases any sign of civilization in a
blanket of green.  Growing in the high canopy, countless flowering
vines add a splash of color to the otherwise green expanse.  Darting
around the flowers are small birds, their wings a blur of motion as they
dip their long beaks into the flowers, feeding on insects hiding
within the blooms.  The trail southward disappears into the verdant
jungle, its destination unclear.  Northward, rubble and vines would make
passage difficult, but still clearer than the vegetation to the east and
west.

Fork in the Path~
Rising out of the jungle to the west is a large crumbling ruin.  Twisted
vines and thick creepers cling to its walls, encasing it in a mantle of
green.  Squat white-stone pillars thrust up from the jungle floor, giving
support to the ruin's low flat roof.  A long sloped ramp leads up to a
circular door made from redwood and bound in iron.  In the filtered light
that escapes the canopy of trees overhead, it is difficult to make out
much fine detail, although it appears to be covered in frescoes.  To the
west the trail ends before the building, while east it heads back into
dense jungle and is quickly lost from sight.  The masses of vines and
multitude of plants prevent passage northward, however it is possible to
climb the heaps of rubble and continue south.

Large ferns sprout from the damp soil, their huge fronds spread out over
the area in an umbrella of green.  Flourishing beneath the ferns are many
mounds of moss.  Poking through the mossy carpet are slender orchids, their
delicate stems bent over under the weight of fragile pink flowers.  Every
surface is coated with light dew left by the misty water that falls down

The jungle path ends in front of a unpretentious wooden hut.  Outside the
hut, a clearing has been hacked out of the lush jungle, the embers from a
recent fire slowly sending wisps of smoke into the air.  The walls of the
structure are made from reclaimed stones and freshly cut white wood
planks.  The roof has been covered in mounds of dried moss and bracken,
aiding in keeping water out.  Through the jungle a white stone wall runs
east and west; once it probably separated the area from the jungle.

Before a Crumbling Ruin~
From out of the verdant growth rises a large squat building, its domed
roof supported by numerous pillars, carved with patterns of snakes. 
Frescoes cover the ruined walls, most of them nearly hidden by tendrils
and strong vines, and the entire building is in danger of disappearing
from sight altogether.  Solid-looking, iron-bound circular redwood doors,
serve as the entrance to the building, a sloping ramp leading up to them. 
Encircling the building scores of great trees cast long shadows over this
section of jungle.  From high up in the tree's canopy, droplets of damp
mist trickle downward to the ground.

Path - Lush Jungle~
Large trees rise out of the tangled undergrowth; their tall branches
intertwine overhead forming a thick canopy.  Barely any light filters
down to the ferns and broadleaf shrubs that cluster around the tree roots. 
From out of the leaf-littered ground, clumps of small orchids flower,
their colorful blossoms attracting many small insects.  Through the
jungle a small overgrown path winds, heading northwards and westward, the
jungle obscuring any view of where it might lead.

A huge tree has fallen here, its death gouging up the ground and
splintering the wall apart.  Over ten-foot in diameter, the tree blocks
progress to the north.  Masses of shattered branches mix with the jumbled
stones of the wall.  From the roots of the trees smaller saplings have
sprouted, racing to reclaim the canopy space that the giant's fall
created.  In the damp ground around the fallen tree, countless small
toadstools grow.

Jungle Path~
A narrow path winds its way through the jungle, around trees and over
small dips and rises before disappearing into the half-light gloom. 
Birdcalls sound overhead, brightly-colored parrots debating territorial
issues with each other, as they fly between the branches of the high
canopy.  A gentle mist-like rain falls from above; it alights on the
smaller plants, collecting on leaves and in flowers, coating them in
sparking dew.

Jungle ruins - Clearing~
Enshrouded by the canopy of thick trees, a ruined tower rises here.  The
top stories have fallen into the shell, sending rubble scattering across
the jungle floor.  Three of the four walls remain, held together more by
vines and creepers than mortar.  Around the tower, masses of broadleaf
plants and vines grow, enjoying the damp conditions and filtered light. 
From out of the rubble surrounding the tower, slender saplings have
sprouted, finding purchase in the moss-covered rocks.

Overhead, the canopy serves as home for several brightly colored birds,

Overhead the thick canopy has been formed from the interlocking of the
giant trees' branches.  The density of the greenery blocks most of the

looping coils of vines, some longer than the trees themselves.  They
exploit any surface, entangling and enveloping branches and trunks of
trees and sending tendrils scattering across the jungle basin.

Jungle Ruins~
With much of its walls and roof covered with green and gold-leafed vines,
it is difficult to determine what the building was, apart from the fact
it is low with a single story.  The walls are made from blocks of stone,
weathering the seasons and neglect better than the wooden roof that has
collapsed into the building.  Moss and fungi sprout from the rotting
wood, the sickly sweet smell of decay hanging heavy in the air.  From the
canopy of trees overhead, a gentle misty-rain falls dripping from leaf,
and frond to form small trickling streams.  Barely visible through the
dark jungle is a north-south running stone wall, that like the ruined
building, is overrun with thick jungle creepers, vines, and moss.  A
badly overgrown trail winds from the building and continues southwards;
while a path heads northwards into the gloom of the jungle.

Long beards of moss dangle down from the rotting wood of the building. 
Dripping water from the high canopy collects in small depressions and on
the broad leaves of the jungle plants, before being absorbed into the

stained and weatherworn, their cracked and pitted surface even more moss
overgrown.  Beside the ancient structure basket fungi grow, their
interwoven stems attract a number of tiny insects.  More fungi sprout

Verdant jungle growth mingles with the crumbling ruins to produce
patchwork of white and green.  Tendrils of vines surge over the stones,

thrust out from the sea of green like the jagged teeth of some lurking
beast.  Barely visible through the jungle to the east is a north-south
running wall; encased by vines and creepers its destination is quickly
lost from view through the wild jungle.  An overgrown trail winds
northward, like the wall it follows, its destination obscured by the
exuberant jungle vegetation.  To the west the jungle seems to open out
into a clearing.

Beneath the weight of countless jungle creepers and vines, the wall has

in shape.  Around the clearing are large piles of dead and dying vines
that have been cut from the surrounding area and off the stones.  The

Small Shrine~
Four white-stone pillars rise from each of the corners and meet in the
middle of the roof, forming elegant support for the room.  Small cracks
and chips in the walls have allowed clumps of moss and lichen to find a
hold, giving the stone a patchwork finish.  Set in the northern wall is a
small altar of black stone.  Thick layers of dried bracken have been
spread on the floor, the smell of rot filling the air.  To the east, an
arch frames a circular door, while to the west a dark tunnel-like
corridor disappears into the gloom.

Tunnel-Like Hallway~
Almost a tunnel, the smooth stone walls of the hallway slope outwards
from the floor and inwards at the ceiling, where they join into a dark
colored keystones.  Across the walls are frescos depicting a great battle
between a gold dragon and a black dragon.  Small cracks in the ceiling,
have allowed water to seep into the hall, where it lies in shallow pools. 
Some of the frescos also show some signs of water damage; the once clear
picture is in danger of being destroyed.  An ornate archway frames a red
wood door to the west whilst the corridor itself continues eastward into
darkness.

Spreading over half the smooth stone walls, the frescoes are made from
thousands of small tiles that depict a huge battle between two titanic
adversaries, a fierce golden dragon and a berserk black dragon.  Between
the mighty foes, an elven maiden stands seemingly unphased or unaware of
the earth-shattering conflict taking place around her.  She holds a
bushel of wheat in her right hand and an emerald-shelled egg in her left.

Dancing across the smooth stone walls are multitudes of fine cracks and

hallway seems fairly good.

The smooth stone walls of the hall slope outwards at the floor and then
back in at the ceiling, giving the corridor a tunnel-like shape.  Fine
cracks and splits mar the stones, in these gaps small patches of lichen
have begun to grow.  Flickering flames dance across the walls, cast from
a shallow, semi-circular bowl that juts out of the wall.  Greasy looking
oil fills the bowl, a small burning tallow wick floating in it.

Running in an east-west direction, the hallway is shrouded in gloom and
partially filled with rotting bracken and rubble.  A few gaps in the roof

Green and gray-colored moss covers the area in a thick spongy layer,
clinging to every available surface and thriving in the damp and gloom.

Grand Shrine~
Rising far overhead is the domed roof of this huge chamber supported by
the many pillars that line the north and south walls.  In the eastern
wall, an intricately carved archway frames a large circular red wood door. 
Although impressive in its original design, the neglect of maintenance is
beginning to take its toll.  Small holes in the ceiling are surrounded by
a fine lacework of cracks, which would be invisible if not for the water
stains that accompany them.  To the west sits a large stone altar, the
wall behind it carved with a huge picture of a golden dragon.

Filtered light shines in through the larger cracks and holes.  Tendrils

golden dragon~
With great wings spread out above it, the golden dragon seems in
mid-swoop.  Huge and life-like, the noble beast's eyes watch the room. 
Even the gigantic painting is not immune to the ravages of time; a fine
crack runs from the floor up to its middle, detracting from the
painting's beauty.

Unlike much of the temple this room has been well maintained.  Covering

In the center of the room is a large slab of rock.  Carved into the
likeness of the head of a gold dragon, its mouth is wide open ready to
bite or breath on some hapless victim.  The life-like details captured in
the rock are vaguely disturbing.  The walls and ceiling of the room are
smooth and unadorned.  Pillars in each of the four corners rise and curve
across to meet at the center of the roof, where they join into a black
keystone.

Gloomy Chamber~
Shallow water fills the floor of the chamber.  The rough walls and roof
have been hacked out of the natural rock, the constant trickle of water
coating them with grime.  Arched exits allow passage into what appears to
be rooms, although the general gloom of the place makes it hard to make
out more details.

Small Circular Room~
Shallow water fills the floor of the small circular room.  The air is
almost as damp as the stones from which the chamber has been hacked. 
Small trickles of water run down the rough rocks.  Cut into the southern
wall is a large alcove.  An archway in the wall allows passageway to the
north.

Tunnel-Like Hall~
Almost a tunnel, the smooth stone walls of the hallway slope outwards
from the floor and inwards at the ceiling where they join into a dark
colored keystone.  Across the walls are frescos depicting a fleet of
tall ships.  The figurehead of the lead ship is in the shape of a golden
dragon.  Tendrils of vines poke through small fissures in the ceiling;
these cracks have allowed water to seep into the hall where it collects
in brackish pools.  Eastward the hallway begins to bend, whilst
westward it ends in a circular door of white wood.

The elegant white wood ships cut through the rough sea, sails billowing

which watch over their passage.

Thrusting through the stone roof spread the tendrils of vines and

echoing even here.

The floor of the room is filled with dried bracken and moss, piled into
large nest-like mounds.  In some, there appears to be small bits of fur,
feathers and soft down.  The walls and ceiling are covered in fine
hairline cracks, and although no holes have appeared, it is only a matter
of time.  The air here seems stale, smelling faintly metallic.  An arch
in the east wall frames a circular white-wood door.

Ancient Ruins - Small Pool~
In the middle of the large circular room is a shallow pool, one end of
which has been shaped into a serpent's head.  Carved out of the floor
below the head is a small bowl-shaped depression.  The walls and ceiling
of the room have been covered in frescoes, most still in reasonable
condition.  From a few cracks in the roof, tendrils of vines have begun
to work their way inside, slowly prying into the stone to gain a purchase
for their roots.  The only way out of the room is a tunnel-like hallway
that head eastward.

the battle has wrought.

Forcing their way into the ruins are the long runners of masses of vines. 
Their tendrils snake across the roof and walls, prying into the stones

the tendrils and the lack of maintenance the ruins have seen.

Jungle Path - Before an Ancient Bridge~
The path ends at the ruins of an ancient bridge that once crossed the
slow-moving river to the west.  Spanning less than a quarter of the
blue-green waterway, the stone bridge offers little aid in crossing the
sluggish expanse.  Overhead the canopy of trees spreads out, blanketing
the area in gloomy shadows.  Thick jungle rises up from across the river,
the remains of the end of the bridge just visible in dense vegetation.

The blue-green waters of the river swirl around the ruined bridge, the

lurk beneath the maelstrom.

Upon a Ruined Bridge~
The crumbling stones of the bridge shudder under the constant assault
from the swirling @bwaters@n below.  At one stage the bridge would have
been an impressive structure, some of its grandiose construction still
visible in its remains.  The end of the bridge is a mess of broken and
cracked stones, dangerously unstable.  On the far bank, the remains of
the bridge have almost disappeared beneath the dense jungle growth.

stones bridge~
Carved from white stone, the ancient bridge once spanned the wide
river, allowing access to the far bank.  The effort to construct it
suggested that perhaps this once was a major road or at least lead to
some place of importance.  Now the central sections have disappeared,
most likely, collapsed into the deep river, and washed away.

Across the river the jungle seems identical to the verdant growth on this
