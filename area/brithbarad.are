Main Hall of Brithbarad~
This large, dark mud building seems to serve as a massive temple.  Altars
covered in skulls and feathers line the walls, with a large slab of
slate prominent in the center of the room.  The slate is covered in dried
blood and charred bones.  A curtain hangs in the doorway to the north,
while a row of beads lines the doorway to the south.  Down a few crude
steps to the east you can see a gravel path, while out an open doorway to
the west a dark ring of trees can be seen.  A stout spiral staircase of
iron leads up to the second floor.

altars skulls feathers~
Each altar is built of thick basalt blocks stacked to form a small
covered arch.  One is covered in a colorful array of feathers and small
bones tied together with small strips of leather.  Another has many
skulls of animals and humanoids displayed on it.  Wax candles burn in the
altars, spilling melted wax over the dark stones.

Dark Grove~
Tall and twisted pine trees crowd together in this dark grove.  The thick
canopy of intertwined branches blocks the sky above, making the area cool. 
Through the close-set trees you can make out the thick and heavy shale
wall of the the fort rising up into the sky.  To the east the slate and
mud walls of a large building rise, and a small set of steps leads up and
into an open doorway.

Dark and Smelly Room~
The dusty slate walls of this room are covered in skins and masks.
Various drying items hang in bunches from the rafters: feathers, leather
strips and drying herbs.  A thin counter separates you from the back of
the store which has even more clutter.  You notice a small sand-filled
bowl against the wall, incense sticks burning and giving off a scent that
assaults your senses.  A row of beads covers the doorway to the north.

A Dark and Cluttered Room~
Workbenches covered with half completed projects and small tools fill
this room.  The everpresent soot has been collecting on some of them for
some time.  Small drawers and vats filled with noxious liquids and
powders are spread about behind the counter.  A curtain hangs in a
doorway to the south.

Warleader's Chamber~
The dark mud and slate walls of the room are covered with grisly trophies
of conquest.  The worn and warped wooden floor is covered with dark
stains and scattered bits of hay.  A spiraling iron staircase leads down. 
Heavy pine beams support the ceiling, and cobwebs and dust are collecting
in the corners.  A worn shield is mounted on sturdy brackets on the wall
behind the desk.

Bend in Gravel Way~
The gravel path makes a sharp turn to the south and east here.  To the
west, a large black mud and slate structure looms overhead, a full two
stories high and looking very official and important.  The path squeezes
between two buildings to the south, while to the east, Gravel Way winds
alongside several huts and hovels.  A squat mud building blocks movement
to the north.

A large hole in the dirt floor releases a stench that makes you nearly

with a sign hanging from its eave.  A thick black-mud building squats to

Trader's Hut~
You have never seen such a cluttered mess.  Broken items lay scattered in
heaps, and items swing from hooks on the ceiling.  It is difficult to
move around in here without tripping on something or banging your head. 
A scarred counter separates you from the back of the shop.  Gravel Way
runs by the shop to the south.  On the west side of the room, a rickety
wooden ladder leads up to a hole in the floor.  Hanging from the ceiling
right next to the hole is a wooden sign, with large letters painted in
bright red paint.  The letters read @RAwxshun Howse@n.

End of Gravel Way~
The ground is a mixture of thick mud and loose gravel.  Hay has been
tossed about in a failed attempt to make the footing more favorable.  A
large stable looms to the north, the sounds of horses mixing with the
loud shouts of the orcs of the fort.  The gravel path leads west towards
more buildings.  The tall shale wall of the fort blocks movement to the
east.

Brithbarad Stables~
Hay bales have been set up to act as a counter along the west wall, while
stalls for the horses are lined against the east wall.  Large wooden
rafters crisscross above your head, and various horse-related equipment
hangs from most of them.  Along the wall behind the counter, horseshoes
have been nailed to the wall in a seemingly random pattern.  A large open
gateway leads south and out of the stable.

Bend in Gravel Way~
The gravelled walk turns sharply here, heading north and east.  Just to
the east you can see a well with a bucket.  Loud cursing and clanging
sounds can be heard from the squat building to the south as it belches
forth the smell of hay and horse.  A medium sized shale-walled building
stands to the west, imposing its dark facade on the street.  A small
wooden sign is bolted to the buildings wall.

Drunken Orc Bar~
A long bar made of old pine planks runs from the north wall about halfway
through the noisy room.  Smoke and soot fill the air, along with the
sounds of drunken orcs.  Strong smells of cheap beer and sweaty orcs waft
by, assaulting your senses.  A curtain of wooden beads hangs in the
southern doorway.  An open doorway leads outside to the east.  The shale
walls of the bar have collected a thick layer of soot and dust.

Smokey Back Room~
A thick smoke wafts through the air in this dark back room.  The smell in
the air is sweet, masking the barely detectable scent of orc sweat.
Guttering and dirty lensed lanterns are mounted in the corners of the
room, and a small raised stage protrudes from the west wall.  The floor
is bare dirt, and the patrons stand watching the show.

large open-doored building sits.  A crooked large-scale hovel stands to

Parade Ground~
The soot-filled air hangs heavily over the gravel field.  The heavy feet
of countless orc grunts have pounded the gravel deep into the mud, almost
paving this area.  Two small wooden buildings, perhaps barracks, flank
the grounds, one to the north and another to the south of here.  The
gravel pathway leads to the west.  To the east, a massive pair of solid
pine gates interrupt the thick shale walls.  A heavy crank is set into
the ground, attached to a long, thick chain looped over a pulley.  Beside
the crank is mounted a heavy lever.

South Barracks~
Straw is strewn about the floor here, and ten worn sleeping cots are
scattered about.  The air is thick and musty, smelling of orc sweat.  The
ceiling is not that high, reaching just over eight feet tall, and a small
wooden staircase leads up.  The doorway to the north leads outside.

Barracks~
Ten dingy cots are spread haphazardly round the room.  Warped boards make
up the floor, walls and ceiling of this room.  An open trapdoor leads
down to the first floor, and a good amount of straw is spread about the
floor.  The air is stale, baked by the pounding sun during the day, and
trapped by the poor ventilation of the room.

Between the Gates~
Gravel is spread about here to aid in walking on the muddy ground.  To
the east and west massive gates built from stripped pine trees are set
into the shale walls.  A tower rises high above you to the north, and a
large iron door provides entrance to it.  This area is obviously intended
to trap those storming the outpost.  A large crank is fixed near the east
gate, with a thick chain looping high over a pulley and attached to the
top of the gate.  There is also a heavy lever beside the crank, most
likely a release which closes the gates in rapid fashion.

Base of the Tower~
The dust covered shale walls rise high above your head.  Through the
cobwebs and hazy air, you can see a wooden roof high above your head.  A
heavy iron gate provides exit south, while a trapdoor high above your
head allows exit to the roof.  The floor is hard packed dirt; the
imprints of many heavily booted feet cover its surface.  A rickety wooden
ladder leads up towards the trapdoor.

Roof of the Tower ~
Rough cut pine planks make the floor here, and creak as you walk.  A
trapdoor leads down.  The crenelated walls come about to chest height of
the orc warriors, providing them wonderful protection from below.  The
air is choked by black soot coming from down below and to the west.  A
glowing torchiere of iron contains a fire that illuminates the area. 
Looking out from the walls you can see the Black Hills and the open
plains below.

At the Gates~
Looming to the west of you are the impressive gates of the orc outpost,
Brithbarad.  To the immediate north of the gates rises a tall tower built
of stacked shale, and guards can be seen scanning the countryside for
interlopers.  The muddy ground is covered in gravel, and crunches beneath
your feet.  A dark cloud of soot hangs in the air, making breathing
difficult.  To the north and south, the tall grass of the Western Plains
approach the walls of the city.

gavel and a ironwood block to pound upon.  The rest of the room is filled
with benches of all makes and sizes, which make up the seating for this
unadorned room.  Tall, square pillars support the roof overhead, where
the struts are plainly visible.  Rusty iron-wrought sconces are placed at
intervals along the walls, with torches lighting the room in a smoky,
dull yellow glow.
