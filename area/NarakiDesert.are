At the Mouth of a Vast Desert~
To the east twist the corridors of an enormous canyon littered with sand. 
The climate here is hot and dry and the land appears extremely barren. 
Only the occasional swirl of dust breaks the monotony of the dry
landscape.  A single section of the merciless desert expands to the south
down through the twisting canyon.  You can see waves of heat visibly
rising up from the desert sands continuously.

Sand-Filled Canyon~
While the bottom of this canyon is filled with sand, it appears that such
was not always the case.  Piles of sands have been swept into the region,
half-burying a few plants around them.  It is as though a giant wind
storm has filled the twisting canyon with sand.  The air here is
oppressively hot, making it difficult to breathe.  As the canyon walls
twist and turn like one of the tunnels in a rabbit's warren from east to
west, the land between them becomes increasingly more barren.

E
twisting canyon walls~
To the north and south loom two walls of sandstone which twist about on
an east-west course.  These canyon walls seem to serve as natural
barriers, keeping the sand within trapped.  The sandstone walls are much
too steep to climb, and doing so might prove more dangerous than it is
worth.  Rocks and boulders perch along the edge of the canyon walls and
look capable of falling at any moment.
~
E
sand~
The sand which fills the bottom of the canyon is so deep that you cannot
feel the hard impact of the true ground below.  Tan in color, the sand
seems remarkably smooth.  Much of the sand has come to gather in small
dunes.
~
E
half-bury few plants~
Up to their stems in sand, a few patches of hardy wild flowers grow here
and there along the canyon floor.  Judging from how green their stems are
and how healthy their petals appear, it strikes you as unusual that the
flowers would be doing so well, if the canyon had always been filled with
sand.

An Underground Pool~
Hidden far below the blazing sands of the Naraki desert lies a large,
underground pool of water.  The clear, cool water covers the entire floor
of the non-descript cavern of limestone.  The air here is cool and crisp
and the faintest aroma of fresh herbs and spices hangs in the air. 
Around the eastern edge of the pool, there is a rich shore of black earth. 
Huge clumps of reeds grow along the shore, blocking out all but the sight
of the pool.  The center of the underground oasis bubbles and gurgles
from being fed by a further underground source of water.

Along the edges of the shore grows a variety of aquatic sedge.  The tall,

Each shoot is segmented and has a strong, musky scent.

pool~
Cool and refreshing, a pool of deep blue water stretches before you. 
While the center of its surface is broken by the upwelling of an
underground spring, the rest of the pool's surface is calm and placid. 
An abundance of tall, papyrus sedges grow along the edges of the pool's
inviting waters.
~
E
shore earth~
Black as night, the soil around the underground pool is very rich in
minerals.  It is unsurprising to see that a host of sedges have taking
root along its edges.

Along the surface of the west wall of this cavern are a series of hand

Great Desert~
Though dunes of sand rise every now and again across the desert plain,
for the most part, the land is flat and lifeless. With sand the
color of dried dung and nothing but wind, rock, and the occasional
corpse, the barren desert landscape leaves much to be desired.  Far to
the north, a large trail or road can be seen, bustling with traffic,
while to the west and east the desert sands spread out through the rocky
canyon.  Southward though, the presense of steep mounds of sand make
travel in that direction unlikely.

Eastward the flat, sandy plain widens out into a broader stretch of
traversable desert.  Here, however, piles of sand form dunes three times
the height of any ent or troll.  Further progress through the sand-filled
canyon is blocked by the surrounding sand dunes.

Great Desert~
To the west and east, the vast Naraki desert continues, its tan sands
sweeping through the region between two craggy rock faces.  The rocky
canyon walls have been worn away considerably by the rough desert sands
and possibly too, by desert rains.  Any evidence suggesting that this
part of the Naraki desert has ever been anything but a desert has been
buried beneath the drifting sands.

These two rock formations are part of a vast, convoluted canyon which
winds its way through this particular section of the Narak desert.  There
is evidence embedded deep in the rocks on both the north and south parts
of the canyon to suggest that at one time, there was water in abundance
here.  The canyon walls here are too steep to climb.

Great Desert~
To the north, a large rocky cliff rises, merging with the craggy rocks to
the west, forming but a single section of a massive canyon wall.  The
wall twists and curves all throughout the desert, intent seemingly in
keeping the desert held within trapped forever between the dauntless hard
rock.  In all other directions, the desert branches out, its tan sands
kicking up now and again to form minor dust devils.

The cliff here is but a part of a massive wall of rock that undulates in

An almost sheer canyon wall runs along the northern edge of the desert,
separating the near endless plains of sand almost completely from the

by steep rocky crags.

After a few moments, there is a flash of bright blue light.  When you are

stands a woman dressed in a flowing gossamer gown.  Like the statue, her
body is firm and lithe and her head bears strong characteristics of a
feline.  About the woman there is a sense of presence.  So strong is this
presence, that you initially neglect the fact that you can see right
through her.

What time does not devour, the sands of the great desert and the carrion
eaters will.  A canyon wall blocks inside part of the desert to the east. 
Several dark, feathered creatures perch atop the wall, watching
everything that passes through this part of the desert.  Somewhere to the
southwest, someone has taken the time to build a cairn of stones and to
the far south rises an impossibly large megalith.  The sands of the
Naraki Desert continue ever onward.

A bleak, barren landscape stretches out in all directions but the west,

stacked.

The tan-colored sand sweeps as far as the eye can see, great mounds of
dunes to the north and east.  Between two such dunes is a crudely stacked
pile of rocks.  Here, the imposing rocky barrier which is the canyon
curves to the south, leaving only the north and east parts of the desert
traversable.  A few clumps of brown desert grass lay scattered about,
clinging to life in the arid land.

bones piles cairn~
Examining the cairn of stones, you notice that the crude pile of rocks is
little more than a few scattered rocks which partly cover and house the
remains of some humanoid creature whose flesh has long since disappeared
(or has been torn) from its bones. It is not apparent how the person
died, though most likely simple exposure was enough.
~
E
person skeleton remains~
The pile of skeletal remains are fairly recent.  Flakes of flesh and hair
still cling to the corpse in many places.  Also, much of the remains are
still bound and covered with clothing.  Tucked beneath a rock near a
clearly visible skeletal hand, there is a small satchel whose leather
surface is as weathered as the rocks piled atop it.

From what you can see of the contents of the small leather satchel, it

The tan-colored sand of the Naraki desert spreads ever onward through the
twisted, rocky canyon.  There are no visible signs of life in this part
of the merciless desert and even if there were, they would probably turn
out to be nothing but mere mirages.  Expanding out in all directions,
nothing mars the monotony of the flat, sandy terrain except a crudely
stacked cairn of stones off to the west.

Whether the heat, lack of water, or lack of food is the cause for this
desert's formation, it is evident that not much in the way of life has
lived within this area for some time - perhaps centuries.  The tan desert
sands are relatively flat and harbor only the occasional bush or patch of
scrub.  Off in the distance to the west, near the rocky canyon wall,
stands a landmark of sorts in this otherwise featureless and barren
desert.

Sand.  As far as the eye can see, there is only sand.  Sand, and the
occasional outcropping of rock which is part of the canyon.  Nature as
well as time seems to have forgotten about this expanse of barren terrain. 
The desolate land stretches out in all directions, with no more signs of
life in any of them.  The steep rocky walls of the canyon slope in from
the west and east, forming a narrow pass to the south, in the general
direction of a colossal stone creation.

A continual series of barchan sand dunes act as both a southern and

The maniacally twisting walls of the canyon surround this portion of the

Probably close to fifty feet tall, a weathered rock stands before you,
its surface worn down by the passing desert storms.  The rock has roughly
four sides and is perhaps three meters in width.  Along the top, the
rocky sides come together and form a point at their apex.

As you glance up at the apex of the weathered rock, you can see that its

form.  In fact, as you look up at it from a different angle, it dawns on

The sands of the desert whip harshly against your skin as you are caught
in a momentary gust of violent wind, an occurrence not uncommon in the
arid wasteland.  The fingers of the desert outstretch fully to the south,
where massive sand dunes, too steep to climb, block passage in that
direction.  A giant whirlwind which has recently passed through this area
has partly uncovered something previously buried in the sand.

Featureless Desert~
Fringed by a tall rocky cliff to the north and a series of massive dunes
to the south, the patch of desert here, little more than a hundred-yard
wide swath of arid land, proceeds west to east.  Not a single blade of
grass nor the smallest of creatures spoils the emptiness of the barren
wasteland.  A path of sorts, bordered by small rocks placed at irregular
intervals, can be seen to the east.

A constant trail of miscellaneous tracks can be seen off to the east

placed rock markers, the trail looks to be a travel route of sorts.

Though they vary in size and shape, each trail marker is basically a
chunk of canyon rock which has fallen away from the ancient walls.  Most

To the distant south rises a immense stone megalith, easily several
thousand horse spans tall.  There does not, however, appear to be a way
to get to the stone creation, for the huge crescent barchan dunes act as
a barrier to the south.  Likewise, the sheer rock canyon cordons off the
north.  In between the two lie the tan sands of the southern desert,
which sweeps from the west to the east.

Desert-Filled Canyon~
Not a single piece of scrub or patch of desert grass graces the arid
soils here.  The barchan dunes to the south, too steep to climb, shelter
this strip of desert from the heaviest winds and sand storms.  Continuing
to both the east and west, this portion of the desert is relatively flat,
in stark contrast to the precipitous barchans.  Between two of the
barchan dunes to the south, you can see the northern base of a pyramidal
structure.

gigantic pyramid~
The pyramid which stands to the south is extremely large.  Its surface is
that of pale green limestone that has no doubt been polished over time by
the abrassive desert sands.  Tracks of hieroglyphics have been etched

fairly distinct but too far away to read from here.

Deep gouges have been cut into the side of the pyramid.  From the

Desert-Filled Canyon~
From east to west runs a narrow but long canyon barely more than thirty
feet wide.  Bound within its rocky walls, the hot, barren desert
threatens to overcome any who travel the arid landscape without proper
precautions. Dense tufts of brown desert grass dot the otherwise
featureless desert.  Although the grass seems to barely cling to
existence in most places, along the north canyon wall they grow quite
thick.

Tranquil Oasis~
Sheltered from the savage winds and blasting sands of the arid desert,
this oasis provides a brief haven from the blistering waves of heat
rising up off the land.  The work of deflation has created a basin within
the rocky canyon, where precious rainfall has collected in a crystal
clear pool of life-giving water.  Around the edges of the basin grow
several sturdy but old palm trees.  Tall desert grasses of a rich green
color nearly obscure the narrow passage into the desert canyon to the
south completely.

The gigantic stone carvings, while quite detailed, mean absolutely

structure have likely been lost, at least for now.  Piles of debris lay

Along the base of the pyramid, piles of debris have collected.  Most of

Desert-Filled Canyon~
The eastern part of the canyon, which ran straight east and west,
branches off sharply to the north, where it diverges into a distinctly
different section of the desert.  The arid wilderness to the north is
composed not of tan sand, but of white and the dunes there are like small
hills rather than curving crescents.  Where the white and tan sands meet,
they do not mix.  Instead, it is as if an invisible barrier keeps the two
desert carefully separated.

Desert-Filled Canyon~
Even though the canyon runs east and west for countless feet in either
direction, here, the rocky wonder that is the twisting canyon chooses to
turn northward, leading into a different type of desert.  The desert
sands to the north are the color of a snow hare's hide.  Also, instead of
steep barchan dunes, the white dunes to the far north resemble ant hills
more than anything else.

Piled high like a gigantic ant hill, the simple sand dunes stand out like

sand, these dunes rise up without pattern or reason.  Even from a

Desert-Filled Canyon~
A wide stretch of desert wasteland stretches west to east between the
towering canyon walls and the sweeping barchan dunes to the south. 
Etched into the face of the canyon, a series of strange pictures, many
too weather worn to examine, catch your eye.

face canyon pictures~
Out of a series of seven or eight cliff carvings, only three remain even
partially intact.  The first shows a man hunched over what appears to be
a jewel.  In his hands he holds what appears to be a crude set of cutting
tools.  Within the second observable carving, a figure, wearing bulky
desert garb and her face hidden by scarves, runs through an expanse of
desert with spiral-shaped dunes.  In her hands she clutches a small gem
much like the one seen in the first carving.  Finally, in the last
pictograph, there is nothing but a rising obelisk.  Around the top of the
obelisk there are rays, suggesting that the pyramidal tip of the monument
sparkles or gleams.
~
E
barchan dunes~
The vast barchan dunes resemble nothing more than huge sandy 
crescents. Formed by erratic desert winds, the crescent dunes rise up 
many times the height of any man. In most cases, the barchans are so 
closely packed that you cannot see between them.

Desert-Filled Canyon~
With a massive series of canyon cliffs to the north and a succession of
sheer tan sand dunes to the south, passage through this portion of the
desert is limited.  To the east, the desert 'corridor' created by dunes
and rock continues in a straight line path.  Further west, the canyon
corners abruptly to the south.  A pictograph, weathered and old, has been
carved into the face of the cliff.

though, faces outward, towards you.  In the maw of the great feline,
there is a small jewel held in place by her wickedly-long teeth.

Desert-Filled Canyon~
The steep cliffs and walls composing the desert canyon end abruptly and

Though your mind knows that the rock walls surrounding both you 
and the desert are just part of one gigantic canyon, your eyes find it

corridor which runs east to west and turns to the south.
~
E
cave~
Barely the height of a human, the small cave at the base of the western
canyon wall is partly filled with sand, although this probably was not
always the case.  In fact, considering the full fury of the sand storms
around here, you would not be surprised if this occurrence is recent. 
The edges of the cave's entrance have been smoothed by continuous
weathering.

A Single Bush~
Incredible. In the middle of the desert, bravely clinging on to life
stands a bush about two feet in height. The tough, green bush, unlike 
most of the wildlife, has apparently adapted to the desert climate and 
thrives. Around the base of the bush, there are a series of tracks, some 
small and some large, indicating that the desert itself is not the only 
thing to watch out for. Beyond the light green bush to the south 
stretches more of the endless seeming desert.

Along the base of the small green bush, there several sets of tracks. One

White Sand Desert~
Tall dunes of sand to the north mark a visible change in the white desert
sands.  Here, the sandy plain is relatively flat and unattractive.  Yet,
the mounds of desert earth to the north are perfectly formed, each with a
symmetric beauty like unto a sculptor's creation.  To the east there is
yet more arid land hidden beneath sand the color of pure white snow. 
Southward, the white sands of the desert merge and yet do not intermingle
with the tan sands which fill the area within the main desert canyon.

E
main canyon~
Once the keeper of an ancient, sunken valley, the twisting canyon now
serves the purpose of sheltering the Southern Narak Desert from outside

Narak, ceases as this portion of the canyon merges with the main section
of twisting canyon walls.

rocky cliffs~
High atop the valley walls there are flat overhangs of rock.  These
cliffs, which surround all the Southern Narak Desert, are quite numerous
but also, unfortunately, quite sheer.  There is no way to climb up to the
cliff, from here.

Though not much cooler than the white sands here, the tan sands of the
main Southern Narak Desert are a welcome change from the blinding white
of the northern dunes.

White Sand Desert~
Filled with white sand, this small desert lies within a part
of the rocky canyon which is all but cut off from a much larger canyon
wall.  Oddly, where the white and tan sands of the two different deserts
join, the sands mingle but little as though a line were clearly drawn
between them.  The floor of the white desert seems a bit cooler than the
other parts of the desert, where waves of heat visibly rise.

The sands here are both white and tan.  It is as though each were a

The canyon here is a smaller, almost separate section of the great canyon
which surrounds the entire southern Narak.  It sweeps around to the north
about the edges of the white desert and merges with the larger, main
canyon to the south.

The great canyon is made up of a series of rocky walls which rise up and

White Sand Dunes~
Sand whiter than snow graces the dry, barren lands which unfold in all
directions.  Much of the white desert remains perfectly flat, shaped by
the gentle, sheltered winds of the rocky canyon.  However, in several
places scattered all over the desert, great piles of sand have suddenly
erupted, as if formed by some gigantic burrowing creature.  These dunes
of white sand stick out like a vyan in a hunting party of elves.

White Sand Dunes~
Though the grey rock of the canyon wall rises up and fences in the
southern portion of the white desert, the wall itself appears to make a
sharp turn off to the east, perhaps expanding the desert.  Here, dunes of
sand, taller than the tallest troll and twice the width of a desert
giant's shoulders, rise up out of the otherwise flat white desert, making
their presence known.  In fact, if not for the sandy white dunes, the
monotony of the sparkling white desert plains stretching out to the
north, east, and west, would surely be maddening.

Rising up and blocking in the white sand desert to the south, grey
canyon walls are insanely steep and tall.  Several of the shorter dunes

White Sand Dunes~
Dunes of white sand stand proudly between the grey rock canyon, which
surrounds the western and southern parts of the desert, and the rest of
the snowy sands of the arid land to the east and north.  The light
reflected off the sands is alarmingly bright, almost blindingly so. 
Other than the occasional dark carrion creature flying above, the white
sand dunes seem barren of life.

Grey as ash and craggy as the wrinkles on an old man's face, the rock

as though they have been swallowed by the white behemoths.

The rocky canyon walls twist and turn like the corridors of a maze.  The

White Sand Dunes~
Sand as white as snow and as shiny as cut diamonds stretches out in a
desert landscape as far as the eye can see.  The white sands flow evenly
across the barren terrain and then surge up to form the occasional dune
of sand.  The dunes of sand in this portion of the desert are extremely
tall and steep.  Northward rises a steep canyon wall which extends to the
west and east, fencing in the white desert sands.

white sand dunes~
Here, there are five tall dunes of sand, which stand out on the flat,
barren wasteland like a full moon in a midnight-black sky.  Ragged bits
of bone litter the surface of the tallest dune.
~
E
bone bits~
The bones sticking out from atop the tallest sand dune here vary in size
and it is impossible to tell what the bones once belonged to.  The only
thing which remains of the creature's skeleton is a single, clawed hand. 
However, from the scraps of meat and clothing still attached to one of
the larger bones, you get the idea that maybe this is not the best place
to be.
~
E
rocky canyon wall~
To the north is a twisted, craggy section of canyon which stretches east
and west, acting as a northern barrier for the blinding white sands. 
There are several cliffs above, which must overlook the desert, but the
rock walls are angled as such that climbing would be impossible.
~
E
skeletal hand clawed~
The skeletal hand has but three fingers remaining, each of which ends in
long, ragged claws.  The index finger, with its long, claw of black,
points down to the base of the tallest dune.
~
E
base~
Along the base of the dune, there are a few remnants of limestone.  Sand
has filled them in nearly completely, making it impossible to tell what
lies below them.
~
E
remnants limestone~
The limestone fragments seem connected together and part of a much larger
network of stone that runs below the desert.  Most of the pale green
rock, though, is covered with loose sand.

White Sand Dunes~
Fenced in by the grey rock canyon wall sweeping from one side to the
other towards the north, the white desert here seems little more than a
pocket of a much greater arid land.  There is little evidence that more
than a small handful of creatures dare to brave the harshness of the
blinding white desert sands.  And judging by the minimal shelter the sand
dunes provide from the scorching sun, nothing could survive out here for
long.  The white desert stretches out in all directions except to the
north.

white sand desert~
Across the sandy plain there are numerous dunes of sand.  Shaped by
desert winds, the ant-hill like sand formations are twice, sometimes even
three times the height of an ordinary man.
~
E
rocky canyon wall~
The grey, rocky canyon walls loom up and form cliffs far overhead.  There
are no foot holds here, as the canyon walls are much too steep.  Several
scratches mark the rocky walls.
~
E
scratches~
The scratches which line the rocky grey walls appear to have been made by
something sharp, perhaps a digging tool or an animals horn.

White Sand Dunes~
A grey rock wall, part of a vast canyon which surrounds this portion of
the Narak desert, towers several hundred feet above the desert and curves
around to surround the sparkling white sands on both its north and east
side.  Although the white sand dunes here are not as graceful or shapely
as the barchan dunes in the main part of the desert, the sandy mounds
still possess an austere beauty.  More dunes of white sand stand to the
south and west.

White Sand Dunes~
The glare reflecting off the white desert terrain and particularly the
dunes of towering sands is blindingly bright.  This appears to be the
southeastern corner of the small white desert. A wall of grey rock, part
of a vast canyon, faces in from the south and east.  Halfway buried
beneath the edge of a extremely tall and massive sand dune, a tree no
taller than a deer, struggles to hang onto life in this desolate land.

tree~
A gnarled, bent tree sticks up out of the white desert sand.  Its roots are
partly exposed and where they are, there are fresh gnaw marks.  Several
large, heart-shaped leaves cling to the tree's sparse branches.  Below the
large leaves there appear to be clusters of some type of brightly-colored
fruit.
~
E
fruit brightly-colored~
A cluster of brightly-colored fruit hangs from beneath on of the larger
leaves of the gnarled tree.  The surface of the fruit appears glossy and
even from where you stand, a vaguely sweet aroma reaches your nostrils. 
Covered with colorful splotches, the fruit looks very delicious.

A plain of sand the color of dry camel dung stretches outward in all

nearby to enable you to get your bearings.  Only the vague outline of a

Endless Desert~
A plain of sand the color of dry camel dung stretches outward in all
directions.  Currently, a furious sand storm is sweeping through the
region.  There are no plants or rocks or any other type of landmark
nearby to enable you to get your bearings.  Only the vague outline of a
colossal pyramid to the east can be seen through the whipping sandstorm.

region.  There are no plants or rocks or any other type of landmark
nearby to enable you to get your bearings.  Only the vague outline of a
colossal pyramid to the east can be seen through the whipping sandstorm.

The Greened Way - Before a Twisting Canyon~
The road through the Greened Way is rough and uneven and becomes
increasingly treacherous as it continues westward.  A lone pine tree and
several shrubs hug the edges of the road as it turns southward into a
rocky canyon.  The canyon walls rise straight upward, like the walls of a
roofless tunnel and the uneven road runs directly through it.  Large
boulders and mounds of black earth block the rest of the Greened Way.

The boulders here seem to have fallen down from atop the steep, canyon
walls to the south.  With but a few well-placed falls, the large grey and
brown boulders have neatly cut off further access to the Greened Way.
~
E
mounds black earth~
Mounds of black dirt lie beside the western edge of the Greened Way.  As
evidence of a recent landslide, the rich black earth has neatly sealed
off the rest of the road which once might have continued in that
direction.  Each mound is much too tall and soft to climb.
~
E
lone pine tree~
A single pine tree grows here.  It stands about thirty feet tall, and
judging by the thickness of its trunk, it is no sapling.  The needles of
the pine are yellow and drooping, as though it suffers some ailment.
~
E
several shrubs~
Most of the shrubs which grow along the edges of the Greened Way here are
usually found in much hotter climates.  The hearty, brown-green shrubs
stand about two feet off the ground and have wiry branches covered with
minuscule buds.
~
E

Clusters of tiny red and pink buds sprout from the limbs of the small
shrubs.  The buds look very delicate.  A fragrance of honey and cinnamon

Desert Path Fringed with Red Sand~
As the desert path stretches through the desert, bullied on either side
by large dunes of sand, the north-south path begins to change.  Red sand
the color of bramberries intermingles and slowly takes the place of the
tan sands of the desert altogether and the irregularly placed stones
which once marked the edges of the desert pass are there no longer.  In
their place, at regular intervals stand rectangular blocks of red granite. 
The path continues to the south and back to the north.

dunes ~
The dunes which stand to either side of the desert path block most of the
view in either direction.  But from what you can see, a colossal pyramid
dominates the landscape to the west.  To the east, the valley-canyon
which encircles most of the Naraki desert encroaches.  Patches of desert
grass struggle for nutrients along the sides and surfaces of the dunes.
~
E
patch grass sides surfaces~
Patches of brown, desert grass which has adapted remarkably well to the
harsh climate, stick up out of the sandy dunes.  The majority of the
grass has taken root along the side of the western dune, at the edges of
some chunks of rock.
~
E
chunks rock~
Several chunks of rock have been set into the side of the western dune
and judging from the looks of things, they have been there from some time. 
The grasses have grown over the rocky chunks almost entirely in a few
spots, where the rocks seem the loosest.
~
E
sand~
The sands of the Naraki are an amazing thing.  Part tan and part red, the
sandy path stretching to the south undergoes a drastic change.  While it
is not uncommon for the presence of varying sediments to slightly alter
the color of nearby sands, the stark contrast been dull brown and
brilliant red is a bit unnerving.
~
E
granite red blocks~
The blocks of red granite each stand about two feet above your waist and
have been cut with precision and artificially polished.  Rather than
being engraved with runes or hieroglyphics, the blocks of granite are
smooth and unadorned.

Den of Snakes~
Set into the side of a very large dune of sand lies a small space lined
with bits of stone and dried desert grass.  Strips of rough, leathery
paper rest on the ground near your feet next to broken shards of something
white and fragile.  A network of grass roots holds together a ceiling of
sand above your head.  Chunks of rock jut inward out of the eastern side
of the hollow.

Desert Path~
All around you, you can see heat visibly rising up off the searing, tan
sand.  Across the barren sea of desolation, there is very little
vegetation or life to be found.  A massive stone structure, pyramidal in
shape, looms to the west like a giant mountain.  Bordered irregularly by
rough grey granite chunks, a thin trail extends from north to south, with
a parting path east.

To either size of the desert path stand chunks of grey granite.

Southwest of a Broken Obelisk~
With dunes of sand rising and falling like sweeping ocean waves, it is
difficult to discern true distances in this hot, arid land.  There is no
water or flora in sight.  For that matter, as far as the eye can see,
there is nothing but sand and rock.  The sole exception to this is the
remains of a tall, pillar of stone which has long since toppled and
crumbled to pieces.  The ruinous structure lies to the northeast.  A path
around the broken monument stretches to the north and east.

Ruins on the Desert Path~
Irregularly spaced bits of stone and rock lie to either side of a path
which extends north to south through the desert.  A thick column of stone
and a wide granite slab lie across the path, blocking most of it. 
Another column of stone rises from the sand opposite the fallen pieces,
unaffected by their toppling.  The immense stone pyramid at the center of
the canyon looms just to the west while there seems to be a crude wooden
corral to the east.

The rectangular slab of granite which lies on the desert path must have,

exposed there are a couple of hieroglyphics tracks.

The Greened Way - Near a Landslide~
Though a few trees and a couple of bushes grow along the sides of the
road, the vegetation appears to be thinning and dying along its western
edges.  Several boulders and tons of black earth form a landslide to the
east, cutting off the rest of Greened Way.  The terrain to the north and
south is rough and rocky, making travel in either direction unlikely. 
Greened Way continues unimpeded to the west, though the ground is much
more uneven.

South of a Broken Obelisk~
The fallen ruins of a once massive monument of stone lies in the sand to
the far north.  It is apparent that the structure has been lying in a
broken heap for some time, for there are dunes of sand and wind-blown
debris gathered along side it.  Between the canyon wall and the tall,
barchan dunes which dot the arid landscape, there is a fairly even path,
which skirts around the collapsed monument to the north.

To the far west rises the impressive, solitary figure of a giant stone
pyramid.  Closer, still, though, to the north, lies a obelisk of stone
which has fallen into the sand below.  The obelisk looks to be from
similar origins as the great pyramid, though its exterior has not the
same brilliant gleam.  The sheer canyon wall to your east eliminates any
possibility of climbing up and getting a better view of the desert.

Hundreds of feet long, a charred and broken obelisk lies in the sand,

sections of its surface have fractured away from it.  Many of the

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
From here, you have a head-on look down the length of a fallen obelisk,
from tip to base.  Though large sections of the monument are covered with
sand, the exposed portions reveal many things.  Even at the tip, where it
is the most narrow, the obelisk is still several times your size.  Sheets
of limestone sheath the pyramidal tip of the obelisk and a few fragments
continue to cling to its upper portion.  Fragments of stone lie scattered
everywhere, having somehow fractured off.  To the west and north lies a
slim stretch of desert which surrounds the charred and cracked monument.

is pock-marked and warped.

E
obelisk monument~
Though you cannot tell for certain what purpose this monument served or
how it came to be in such a state, you do notice how odd it seems that
nearly every trace of hieroglyphic writing which once adorned its
exterior has fractured or melted away from the core structure.  Only a
few hieroglyphs remain on its surface.
~
E
broken stone~
Many of the stone fragments dispersed around the tip of the obelisk are
melted and fractured pieces of limestone, which undoubtedly once covered
at least the upper section of the tall stone pillar.  Other some bits
found within the area are sections of stone once composing the surface of
the quarry stone blocks this obelisk had been erected from.
~
E
portions exposed~
The portions of the obelisk which remain above the desert's sandy depths
add disturbing thoughts to your mind.  From the black scorch marks along
much of the obelisk, you can tell something very hot and intense struck
the obelisk.  This fiery blast was enough not only to knock the obelisk
over, but to also flay the stone off much of its surface.  You also find
it quite odd that even though the obelisk was struck by such a force,
that its core remains intact.

To the west lies the ruins of a tall, tapering monument, which must have
stood nearly a third as tall as the great pyramid itself.  While cracks
run up and down the surface of the obelisk, much of its core stone is
intact.  It appears that the impact of the fall only served to chip away
at the surface faces of the pillar.  Caught between the obelisk and the
canyon to the east, the desert twists between the two, running a north to
south course.  The tip of the obelisk lies here and just to the south. 
One of the stones on the west side has a carving on it, that doesn't
appear to fit in with the hieroglyphics.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
To the southwest lies the fallen remains of a giant obelisk built from
pale orange quarry stone.  At some point, it appears the pillar of stone
broke from its foundation to the far west and toppled southeast into the
desert sands.  Parts of the obelisk lie buried beneath the sand while
other parts are fully exposed.  Fragments of stone lie everywhere.  The
desert here is not much more than a narrow strip of sand curving between
the fallen obelisk and the canyon which forms both a northern and eastern
barrier.

obelisk fragments stone~
Here, you can see almost the full length of the obelisk, or at least what
remains, for it is apparent that a significant portion of the tapering
pillar of stone lies buried beneath the sand.  From base to tip, the
obelisk was probably no more than a third of the height of the great
pyramid to the west.  At one time, the upper third of the carved stone
was sheathed in limestone and the rest of its surface was decorated with
intricate hieroglyphics, of which, only a few remain.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
The remains of a once tall obelisk now lies in ruins in the sand here. 
Bits and pieces of the obelisk are scattered everywhere, dispersed by its
tragic fall.  The majority of the stone pillar is intact and buried
beneath the sand it would appear.  Thousands of tiny fragments lie about,
scattered in the direction of the fall.  To the west you can see the
obelisk's crumbling foundation and to the south you can barely make out a
portion of the tip of the obelisk.  A swath of desert extends around
between the canyon and the obelisk.

natural caused the obelisk to fall.

Here, the canyon keeps a fairly straight path, traveling east to west. 
But to the far east, the canyon turns sharply to the south and appears to
head in that direction for quite some time.
~
E
tip~
From what you can glimpse of the tip of the obelisk, it lies a good
distance to the south and is sheathed, at least partially, in the same
type of smooth, polished limestone as the great pyramid to the west.
~
E
obelisk~
Little of the obelisk's surface remains intact, though before its fall
every inch of it much have been covered with hieroglyphics.  Now, only a
handful of hieroglyphics can be seen along its surface.  Much of the
obelisk lies buried in the churning tan sands of the desert.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
Directly to the southeast lies a tapered, rectangular stone carving. 
Made of pale orange quarry stone, the obelisk lies in many pieces on its
side, having at some point broken from its foundation and shattering as
it impacted the ground.  The tip of the obelisk presumably is somewhere
to the southeast, in the direction that the stone pillar fell.  Between
the canyon to the north and the rising sand dunes, the desert arcs in a
broad path around the fallen pillar of stone to the east and south.

E
pillar stone obelisk~
Much of the tapering pillar of stone has been destroyed, either by
whatever caused its fall in the first place or the fall itself.  Chunks
of stone lie spread across quite a large area southeast of its broken
foundation.  The bottom of the obelisk is jagged and crumbling,
indicating that its destruction occurred a long time ago.  A lot of the
pillar's exterior has been eroded by wind.  Be that as it may, you can
still make out a few traces of hieroglyphics amidst the cracked and
charred surface of some of the obelisk's many pieces.
~
E
foundation~
The foundation of stone where the obelisk was once firmly attached is
cracked and charred, as though it were struck with a massive bolt of
lightning.  Parts of the stone have begun to crumble and flake, but the
sections which are intact bear distinctive hieroglyphics.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
There are two series of hieroglyphics.  One set adorn the crumbling
remains of the obelisk's base while the other adorn the faces of the
obelisk itself.
~
E
tip~
You cannot see the tip of the obelisk from here.  But judging from the
size of what you can see, the top of the obelisk must lie a few hundred
feet to the southeast.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
Just to the east lies a tapered column of stone roughly a third as long
as the pyramid to the west is tall.  The large obelisk remains mostly
intact but partly buried beneath the ever shifting sands.  Fragments of
it, particularly pieces of its surface, rest in a scattered mess all
around the obelisk, in the direction in which it fell.  To the north, you
can see the cracked and crumbling foundation the obelisk must have once
stood upon and to the west lies a macabre trail through the exposed
skeleton of some titanic creature.

path~
The path to the east looks to be just a continuation of the narrow desert
path which travels through this area of the desert.  But instead of being
outlined by marker stones, it appears that it was deemed just as
efficient to use the ribs of the skeleton to guide the path.
~
E
foundation~
The foundation of stone at one time provided a base for a colossal stone
pillar that now stands in ruins to the north.  Most of its surface is
blackened and cracked.  Where it is not, the stone is crumbling.  Many of
the bits of stone strewn about are jagged and charred, as if some hot and
powerful force was brought to bear over every little piece.  A few of the
stone pieces looked to have once been awash in carved hieroglyphics, but
their surfaces are all but illegible now.

Desert Path~
The skeleton of a gigantic creature lies stretched before you and
continues back to the south.  Its skull, fully as big as you, points to
the north, its jaw agape.  The bones of its many-jointed neck curves in a
sweeping 'S' shape in the tan sands.  The back bone of the creature lies
buried beneath the sand, but its exposed ribs jut straight upwards. 
Rather than side stepping the huge skeleton, the desert path continues
straight through its center, using the rib bones as macabre path markers. 
To the east, where there are fewer dunes, you can see the fallen ruins of
a colossal stone pillar.

skull~
The skull of this mammoth creature has an elongated snout, a wide cranial
area, and jutting horn bones.  Though many of its teeth are missing, the
few that remain are yellow, cracked, and very sharp-looking.  The most
unusual thing about the skull is that, no matter which way you turn, you
have the oddest sensation that you are being watched from its empty
sockets.
~
E
rib bones path~
Through the center of the gigantic skeleton's ribs, the desert path
continues to run to the south.  But instead of using bits of stone and
rock for boundary markers, it appears that the ribs of the creature have
been made to act as substitutes.  Each rib in the skeleton is fully three
times your height and size.  The entire ribcage stretches outward to the
south, where there appear to be other bones which are not as intact.
~
E
neck~
The neck vertebrae of this creature are large and numerous.  In respect
to its body, the neck is at least as long.  A couple of the neck bones
towards the middle are chipped and broken while others have signs of
having been cracked and healed while the creature was alive.

Desert Path~
Under the lingering presence of the immense stone pyramid to the west,
you cannot help but feel self-conscious of every move you make through this
desert domain.  Rising dunes with graceful crescent shapes spread
throughout the desert, inhibiting travel to the east.  Edged by bits of
stone and rock, a narrow trail heads north to south, providing a perfect
path throughout the arid wasteland.  At one point along the path two
columns, one to either side, and a slab of stone rests atop them like a
plank.

of them.

slab~
Its weight distributed between the two columns, this slab of granite
rests a good forty or fifty feet in the air.  Coupled with the twin
columns, the slab helps to frame a make-shift threshold or doorway
through which, however, there is only more desert.  Along the edges of
the slab, there seem to be some glyphs.
~
E
path trail~
The desert path outlined by irregularly placed bits of rock and stone
shows some signs of recent travel.  There are several sets of tracks in
the sand, as well as a couple of piles of semi-fresh dung.  Most of the
tracks, though, seem to end at the threshold of the twin columns.

Desert Path~
Except to the east, where an unusually large dune rises up, the desert
lies travelable in all directions.  The most unusual feature about this
stretch of arid wasteland is that a small desert trail runs right through
the center of a gigantic skeleton.  In through its ribcage and out
through its pelvis bone, the path runs an efficient though macabre course
through the creature's fallen body from north to south.  A hot breeze
blows quietly through the area, stirring up sand with its to the hazy-red
sand storm lingering on the southern horizon.  To the west looms the
ominous stone megalith of a pyramid.

path~
The only thing not quite right about the desert path heading north and
south here is that it runs straight through the ribcage of a gigantic,
deceased creature.  Instead of using rocks and stone for markers, the
trail maker simply designated the rib bones of the skeleton to be such. 
(It is not like the creature was using its ribcage any more, now is it?)

~
E
creature skeleton~
The skeletal remains of the colossal creature are remarkably well intact. 
Though you cannot be certain due to most of it being buried in the sand,
you might hazard to guess that the entire skeletal structure is still
there, lying where the creature fell however many years ago.

Sand-Filled Canyon~
The canyon walls loom above your head as the canyon proceeds to run an
east-west course.  Sand the color of dried dung fills the canyon to the
point that there is no other visible ground besides that which is covered
by sand.  The canyon twists and turns like a wounded sidewinder snake. 
Atop the edges of the canyon walls stand assorted rocks and boulders,
some of which look like the could fall at any second.

Balanced precariously along the top edges of the canyon are several

Unfortunately, the ones that seem most ready are fairly large.  A good

canyon walls twisting~
Twisting to and fro on an east-west course, the sandstone canyon walls
meander like a river.  Caught between their looming masses is an area of
ground whose surface has been completely covered with sand.  Upwards,
atop the canyon walls, you can see a few rocks and sandstone boulders,
each of which look dangerously close to falling.
~
E
sand dried dung~
Atop the sand that covers the canyon floor are small, rising mounds of
accumulated sand.  Dunes of tan-colored sand in the shape of crescent
moons lie scattered across the canyon's sandy surface.  Every now and
again, a tiny dust devil kicks up the sand, sending it swirling about.

To the west, a series of three inter-linked barchan dunes lie against the
eastern base of the giant stone pyramid.  Directly opposite the dunes, to
the far east, stretches a gruesome trail crossing lengthwise through the
ribcage of a giant skeleton.  To the south, the tan-colored sands of the
desert slope downward, creating a bowl in the sand.  Several bunches of
grass grow within the shallow depression.

Eastern Side of a Spectacular Pyramid~
You stand at the base of the colossal stone pyramid which seems to rest
in the exact heart of the desert-filled canyon.  Here, and to the south,
the sandy dunes which usually hug the base of the pyramid are absent.  In
their place rises part of the surrounding canyon.  Gleaming yellow-green
limestone covers nearly the entire structure, except for a few places
along the base where the quarry stone blocks of the titanic edifice have
been revealed.  Off in the distance to the east, you can see the fallen
remains of an obelisk.

          Five and fifth are one in the same,

Outside of a Corral~
Built into the side of an extremely large barchan dune, the impromptu
animal pen looks large enough to hold eight to ten fairly large animals.
A wooden gate with a crude latching mechanism encloses the pen.  Just to
the right of the gate, there is a small wooden bench sitting under a
makeshift awning.

E
awning~
Suspended from three pieces of wood lodged into the sand, a piece of
tattered cloth flaps in the desert breeze.  The cloth is thin and faded,
and has several holes in its fabric.  Nevertheless, it provides enough
shade for any sitting on the bench.
~
E
pen~
Though crude, the wooden livestock pen has been built in a simple fashion. 
It uses the back of a sand dune as one of its walls, and as support for
an overhanging roof which covers a third of the pen, providing shelter
the animals during the worst times of day.  Within the pen, you can see
stacks of hay, a trough filled with liquid, and a fire pit dug deep into
the ground.
~
E
gate latching mechanism~
The wooden gate to the pen is held together with strips of leather and
bits of wire.  It uses thick leather strips for hinges and has an unusual
latching mechanism fashioned from a corroding brass plate and a
crook-shaped piece of wire.
~
E
bench~
The small wooden bench resting under the awning is little more than a
plank of driftwood suspended between two blocks of rock.

Camel Corral~
Situated towards the eastern part of the Naraki desert, this partly
roofed area holds all that is necessary for keeping livestock. 
Half-rotten wooden planks and bits of driftwood have been messed together
with heavy woven grasses and pieces of wire to create a semi-sturdy pen. 
Piles of hay lie towards the back of the pen, next to a long, skinny
trough filled with water.  And as far away from the hay as possible,
there is a deep fire pit.  Near the latching gate to the pen are several
pegs, from which hang several objects.

E
gate latching~
The latching mechanism on the gate looks quite simple.  It is made up of
a beaten bronze plate which has corroded a nice green color and a piece
of bent wire.  Simple though it may be, it is sufficient for keeping any
dumb animal penned up.
~
E
hay~
Dry and lifeless, the piles of hay stacked at the back of the animal pen
look very tasty.  Yeah, right.  And Lord Richard does not know how to use
a shield and sword.  If you were an animal and had to eat this stuff, you
probably would not, especially if your life depended on it.
~
E
trough water~
Vile and murky, the only thing which can be said about the water in the
rotting wooden trough is that it is wet.
~
E
fire pit~
Dug deep into the ground and surrounded by chunks of rock, the fire pit
provides warmth without risking injury to the animals.  Some of the rock
chunks look to have once been part of some other, man-made construction,
for they bear designs.
~
E
designs~
The designs which are cut into the surfaces of a couple of the granite
rock chunks are ancient hieroglyphics.

Eastern Side of a Vast Pyramid~
To the east and south, the tan desert sands rise and fall like undulating
ocean waters.  But here, standing at the base of the greatest stone
construction you have ever seen, the sands are calm and relatively flat. 
The surface of the entire pyramid gleams brightly as the light reflects
off its pale yellow-green limestone sheathing.  At the pyramid's base, a
few pieces of limestone have fallen away, to reveal orange quarry stone
blocks beneath.

limestone surface~
The sections of limestone covering the surface of the pyramid is of a
pale, yellow-green color.  Polished smooth by wind and rain, the
limestone has the luster of a precious jewel.  Large portions of the
limestone, especially around the base, are caked with sand.  
~
E
base quarry blocks ~
Where pieces of limestone sheathing are missing, the heavy, immense
blocks of pale orange quarry stone are revealed.  Roughly trapezoidal in
shape, the blocks must weigh several tons.  Littering the ground along
the pyramid's base, there are several fragments of stone.
~
E
fragments stone~
Many of the stone fragments scattered near the base of the pyramid are
chunks of quarry stone and not the more valuable limestone.  From the
deep cut marks both in the base stones and in the fragments themselves,
it looks as though someone were trying to dig past the hieroglyphics
etched into the rock.  The only hieroglyphic tracks that remain intact
encircle part of the pyramid's tip.

Desert Path~
The desert broadens in every direction but the east.  Here, the twisting
bushes are surrounded, in an oval design, by a border of rocks, setting
the bushes apart from the desert like an island amidst the ocean waters. 
Two paths, which are also bordered by similar rocks, stream in from the
north and west, flowing around the bushes to merge into a single trail to
the south.

bushes~
There are two bushes marooned on the island of sand.  The first bush has
crescent-shaped leaves, red stems, and tiny purple berries. The second bush
has heart-shaped leaves twice the size of your hand, thick purple stems,
and a few pieces of luscious red fruit.
~
E
berries purple~
Hanging beneath some of the oval leaves of the first bush there are a few
ripe, purple berries.  The berries themselves have a glossy surface and
look very tasty.
~
E
fruit red ~
Only a couple pieces of red fruit dangle from the branches of the second,
more stout bush.  You doubt that it could support many more.  As red as
the setting sun and nearly as bright, the waxy-textured fruit looks very
tempting.
~
E
oval island~
The stones placed around the two bushes have been placed with the utmost
care and eye for artistic quality.  The oval is perfectly symmetric in
respect to the two bushes and the stones themselves are cut in uniform
shapes and sizes.
~
E
stones~
Each stone surrounding the island of bushes has been cut into the shape
of a rounded cylinder.  The stones are made of granite and have been
carefully smoothed.
~
E
trail path~
As the trail merges together from the north and west, to circle around
the two bushes in the center of this portion of the desert, the border
stones become more regularly shaped and spaced.  The exact placement of
the stones here, around the bushes and along the path, has meaning beyond
merely that of simply protecting the bushes.

Desert Expanse~
As you stand just east of the colossal stone behemoth that is the
pyramid, you cannot help but feel drawn to it.  But the tall, barchan
dunes to the west and north, too steep to climb, cut off access to the
pyramid.  Now and again, a violent gust of wind sweeps through the area,
kicking sand up into your eyes.  Yet more dunes lie to the south.  And to
the east, well within the boundaries of the twisting canyon, lies a path
bordered by ramshackle bits of stone.

Rising into the sky and looming ominously overhead stand a series of
crescent-shaped dunes.  The dunes surround you in all directions but the
north, which leads to a wider and flatter expanse of arid terrain.  The
back two wheels of a small wagon stick up out of the side of one of the
southern barchan dunes, as if the desert has not had time to consume the
entire thing.

Desert Path~
Littered with pieces of driftwood, the desert trail which descends
through the area curves gently from the west to the south in a great arc. 
The trail is marked by irregularly placed stones at its fringes and has a
particularly tall stone at the apex of the arc.  A pair of short and
squat bushes can be seen growing to the south while to the north there is
nothing but the looming presence of a massive barchan dune.

The crescent-shaped barchan dune to the north is extremely tall and steep. 
So steep, in fact, that it is impassable.  Small foot prints dot the
surface of the dune.
~

The small foot prints appear to end in claws.  Also, behind the prints
there in a singular, wavy line in the sand as though something long and thin

~
E
stone apex arc ~
At the apex of the curving trail, a particularly large stone stands at
its edge.  There are no markings on the stone or anything else unusual
about it.  Lying at the base of the stone, though, rests the still form
of a dead bird.
~
E
dead bird~
The small black bird sleeping the sleep of the dead here has only been
gone for a couple of hours, maybe a bit more.  Its body lies in a
crumbled mass, with its back arched and its neck thrust outward in an odd
angle, like it was seized by death suddenly.  Judging from its sleek
black feathers and bright orange beak, the bird appears to have been a
crow, a crow a long way from home.  Still clutched in the crow's claws
there is a sprig of something green.
~

The green sprig clutched in the dead crow's claws looks to be part of a

Desert Path~
Though tall barchan dunes rise up tall and steep to both the northwest
and northeast, the desert elsewhere is relatively flat.  As the
rock-bordered trail runs its course from north to south like a meandering
river, the trail branches off to the east.  Both the main trail and its
tributaries are edged with erratically placed border stones.

Desert Path~
The desert spreads out in all directions but to the south, where a series
of three dunes rising side by side block the way.  While the desert path
curves from the north to the east, the great pyramid looming to the west
dominates.  All along the desert path, the recent passing of travelers
other than yourself can surely be seen.

trail path~
The small path through the desert extends from the north to the east,
curving gently as it turns.  The stones bordering its fringes do so at
closer intervals to the east than they do to the north.  From the
scattered foot prints of what look to be travelers, to the hoof prints of
perhaps horses, there are many sure signs that people other than yourself
have passed this way recently.

An Oasis~
Hidden within a pocket in the canyon, a cool and inviting oasis beckons
to you to have your fill of its lush waters.  The oasis consists of a
single pool with a spout of water gurgling upwards like a fountain. 
Gleaming white rocks encircle the edges of the pool providing a nice place
to sit and recuperate from the barren wasteland.  All around the rocks
grow a ring of palm trees, which cover the entire area with precious
shade.  The canyon wall to the west shows signs of a recent rockslide.

fountain pool water~
Gazing into the cool waters of the oasis, you can see tiny, fiery-red
fish swimming in its gurgling waters.  Since the oasis is not very deep,
it must be fed by an underground spring.  All along the bottom of the
pool, shiny pebbles sparkle and catch your attention.
~
E
shiny pebbles~
The shiny pebbles found along the bottom of the oasis look just like
river pebbles except that some of them have a peculiar sparkle to them.
~
E
rocks gleaming white~
Situated around the edge of the oasis there are numerous white stones
which gleam brightly in the light.  For the most part, the rocks look to
be composed of quartz.  But usually, not even quartz sparkles as brightly
as these stones to.  The rocks are just the right size for sitting on.
~
E
palm trees~
A ring of palm trees grow around the oasis pool, providing more than
adequate shade.  At least twice your height, the tall palm trees are
green with life.  In all, there are twelve trees, and they appear evenly
spaced.

Desert Path~
Pinched in on either side by barchan dunes, if you can call the near
endless expanses of desert between as such, the desert stretches openly
only to the south and north.  The same well-trodden path bordered by
irregularly placed rocks continues onward in these directions, providing
a marked trail.  There does not appear to be an end to the trail in sight, 
nor does there appear to be a way to reach the great megalith which is
the pyramid from here.

trail path~
Far from ordinary, the travel path here looks to have been recently
altered from its original course.  The markers to either side of the path
are new and they bear freshly painted insignias.  It's likely that a
recent desert storm could have buried the older markers and that whoever
maintains this trail found it much easier just to make a new path rather
than find the old one.

Inside a Broken Obelisk~
The interior of the broken obelisk is little more than a small, square
chamber with a curving, vaulted ceiling.  At one time, four marble
columns, one to every corner, stood, rising up to the ceiling as if to
hold the roof aloft.  But clearly, since all but one column is broken and
scattered about the floor in a thousand different pieces, the marble
pillars served only an ornamental function.  The walls of the quarry
stone chamber are all adorned with colorful panels of hieroglyphics,
though deep cracks tear through several of them, rendering them, for the
most part, illegible.

E
columns marble pillars~
The one remaining column has a cylindrical shaft of grey marble.  Both
its capital and its base, though, are hewn from a deeper grey marble,
which is almost black in color.  All three pieces of the column are
flecked with shiny, metal impurities.  Next to one of the broken columns
lies a brittle slab of rock.
~
E
metal impurities~
The flecks of metal riddling throughout the marble of the one remaining
column look to be pieces of silver or steel.  Otherwise, though, they are
simply impurities.
~
E
shattered pieces~
From what you can mentally reconstruct, given what remains of the other
three columns, each looked much the same as the one which still stands. 
Broken pieces of ash grey marble lie everywhere.  The deep cracks running
through the marble shirds are not localize, but rather spread all
throughout the shattered pieces.  This leads you to believe that some
natural force, perhaps an earthquake, caused their destruction.
~
E
ceiling~
The ceiling of this chamber vaults in such a way as to create a point
directly over the center of the chamber, and to give the ceiling's shape
a pyramidal look.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
Numerous panels of hieroglyphics score the walls of the obelisk's
interior.  But sadly, the same force which demolished three of the four
marble columns in the chamber has also torn the surface off of most of
the panels, leaving them bare but for a few meaningless marks.  Out of
all the panels, only the third, eighth, and eleventh hieroglyphic panels
are completely intact.
~
E
walls 1 east~
Aside from being hewn from massive blocks of orange quarry stone and
fitted perfectly into place, there is little that is out of place among
the pale walls.  The one unusual thing about the chamber walls is a block
of stone wedged tightly up against the eastern wall.

As proclaimed by the Goddess in Her last moments, there is a twelve-fold

Desert Path~
From north to south, a trail runs through the desert, kept in check by a
boundary of irregularly shaped and placed stones.  As the path goes
further south, there are increasingly frequent tracks in the sand. 
Though a series of tall, barchan dunes rise up to the west, the great
pyramid can still be seen.  Just east of the stone-edged path, the desert
branches off between two simple sandy mounds.  The sands to the east have
a distinctive ripple pattern about them.

Unlike the graceful, crescent-shaped barchan dunes that are
characteristic throughout the tan-colored sands, the two dunes to the
east are simple, even mounds of sand that look like vast termite mounds. 
Between the two mounds, there is an expanse of flat desert sand whose
surface ripples like the ocean waters.

The murmurs of a dry, arid breeze drifts in from both the west and the

you see little but dunes and sand.  As you get closer to the gigantic
pyramid to the southwest, the sands of the desert begin to rise up and
form crescent-shaped, barchan dunes.

Ripples in the Sand~
Edged in on the north, east, and south side by the twisting canyon, the
desert here dead-ends.  As the tan-colored sands spread out over the
terrain, though, they seem to ripple and undulate, seemingly on their own
accord.  The wind is not to blame, for there is not even a breeze. 
Rather, every now and again, you can detect the slightest of tremors
below your feet.  From somewhere to the east, seemingly beyond the canyon
wall, you can smell the vaguest hints of fresh water.

East to west, through the flat and barren wasteland which is the Naraki
Desert, stretches the bordered trail.  Various types of tracks have begun
to show up on the trail, most of which look to belong to heavy beasts of
burden.  The trail seems to curve around to the far east, around the

East of an Ancient Pyramid~
Here and to the north, the undulating waves of desert sands have
flattened enough so that passage directly up to the base of the pyramid
is possible.  As you gaze up at the pyramid from directly below, its
sheer size boggles your mind.  From the pale yellow-green limestone
sheets sheathing its surface to the massive quarry stones revealed by
missing limestone along its base, the colossal structure demands full
attention.  The upper portion of the pyramid, near the tip, stands out
the most, for the limestone up there is of a slightly different color.

E
limestone~
For the most part, the entire outer surface of the pyramid is covered
with interconnected sheets of pale, yellow-green limestone.  The
limestone is smooth, having been polished by the abrasive hands of the
desert winds.  Except towards the tip of the pyramid, the limestone has
the same uniform color and texture.
~
E
base quarry stone~
The base of the pyramid tells a story other than magnificence about the
pyramid.  When the limestone has been removed to expose the orange quarry
stone beneath, the stone blocks are often heavy cracked and chipped, as
though the burden of the pyramid were too much for them to uphold any
longer.  Where the quarry stone looks to have been exposed the longest,
there is writing chiseled into the stony surface.
~
E
writing chiseled~
A few simple words are chiseled into the exposed quarry stone blocks:

 "Only when they are all aligned shall it come to pass..."
~
E
top tip~
Along the top of the pyramid, just a few meters or so for the tip of the
pyramid, the limestone sheathing is of a deeper green color rather than a
pale yellow-green.  Cut into this colored limestone are hieroglyphics.

East of an Ancient Pyramid~
Here the desert sands have given way enough so that you can stand right
up against the eastern wall of the great pyramid.  From what you can see,
the entire pyramid, with the exception of a few spots along its base, has
been sheathed in a type of pale yellow-green limestone, which has been
polished smooth by the abrasive desert storms.  Up near the tip of the
pyramid, a series of hieroglyphics, each nearly as tall as you, encircle
the top of the stone structure.  Closer towards the ground, there are
deep gouges in the stone.  The desert opens up to the east.

gouges~
Several deep gouges have been cut into the side of the pyramid, deep
enough to expose the pale orange quarry stone beneath.  The gouges seem
to serve little purpose, save to prove that there is solid stone beneath
the limestone sheathing.

Desert Path~
Varying sizes of rocks stand to either side of a path which makes its way
through the tan sands of the desert.  On the south side of the trail,
there is nothing but sand.  No grasses or other signs of life can be seen
outside the boundaries of the trail.  On the path here, though, there are
the beginnings of a set of tracks.  To the southwest looms a colossal,
pyramid-shaped construction.

The stones bordering the path which curves from the north to the east are

part of the trail, there are a series of tracks.
~
E
tracks~
There are three sets of tracks leading down the trail towards the east. 
The first set is composed of a pair of parallel lines, probably made by a
wagon.  The other two sets of tracks are nearly identical and look to be
the hoofed foot prints of some type of beasts of burden.

Desert Path~
Just to the south, an impossibly giant structure stands in the middle of
the valley now turned desert.  The great megalith is shaped like a
pyramid and its outer surface has been sheathed in gleaming limestone. 
The edges and base of the monument, though, have been stripped of their
limestone casing and the colossal quarry blocks beneath have begun to
crumble.  To the east lies a desert trail.

Where the limestone sheathing has been removed from around the base of
the pyramid, blocks of square, pale yellow quarry stone have exposed. 
Each block is about as tall and long as a troll and must weigh as much as
a small mountain.  So far, in this twisted canyon, there are no signs of
this pale yellow stone being native to the region.

pyramid megalith~
It is pointless to try and measure how large or tall this structure
really is.  Towards the top of the pyramid, near the tip, there are
etched designs in the limestone.  You'd have to move further south to see
them.

limestone~
Polished by the natural weathering effects of the desert, the limestone
sheathing encasing most of the pyramid practically glows.  Towards the
top, a series of hieroglyphic designs have been chiseled into the
pyramid's surface.  The hieroglyphs are much clearer to the south.

Colossal Stone Structure~
Mounds of tan sand huddle against the side of the pyramid, obscuring most
of its crumbling base.  Deep gouges have been chiseled into the side of

chunk of limestone, mostly covered in sand, lies in the dirt at your feet.

Once part of an even greater sheet of limestone sheathing, this piece of

surface is smooth and polished and there is no hint as to how the

towards its tip, are a series of chiseled hieroglyphics encircling the
top of the monument.

gouges~
Deep gouges have been cut into the side of the pyramid.  From the

structure.

Outlined by irregularly placed rocks and boulders, a path leads west and
south through the desert.  Currently, no tracks but your own have
disturbed the sandy trail.  The twisting rock canyon which seems to
encompass the entire desert looms overhead to the north and to the far
east, creating steep, inwardly sloped cliffs.  To the west stretches a
featureless expanse of arid wasteland.

Twisting Canyon Littered with Sand~
The walls of this sandstone canyon loom more than a hundred feet above
your head, belittling your presence.  Undulating like an ocean's wave,
the canyon curves and shifts so that it is possible to see where it opens
onto a rough, uneven road to the northeast, its main course lies along a
twisting path to the west and east.  The road is unreachable from here,
because of the way the canyon curves.  Piles of light brown, almost
tan-colored sand litters the floor of the twisting canyon.  The sand
serves as a preamble for what lies westward it seems, for in that
direction, sand appears to cover the entire canyon bottom.

light brown tan-colored sand~
The tan-colored sand which covers the floor of this twisting canyon is
extremely fine and smooth, even for sand.  Small dunes of sand little
more than ankle deep lie scattered about.
~
E
canyon twisting walls~
To the north and south loom two walls of sandstone which twist about on
an east-west course.  These canyon walls seem to serve as natural
barriers, keeping the sand within trapped.  The sandstone walls are much
too steep to climb.

1 west~
As the canyon continues onward to the west, it becomes increasing filled
with sand.  The temperature in the area is also noticeably more hot.

1 northeast uneven road rough~
Due to the canyon's twisting and turning, you can see a rough, uneven
road which stands to the northeast.  A few pieces of vegetation grow
alongside the road, giving it a green look.

Under the Pool~
The waters under the pool are dark and murky.  Bits of flesh and bone
whisk past you, drawn on strong, whirling currents.  You can see little
in the water that is still alive.  A heavy sense of impending doom weighs
heavily upon your shoulders.

Twisting Canyon~
The walls of this canyon are made of sandstone and look increasingly
unstable the higher they rise.  A few rocks balance precariously atop its
edges and look as though they might fall at any second.  Overall, the
canyon walls loom more than a hundred feet above your head.  The
beginning of a rough, uneven road bordered by greenery lies to the north
while to the west the rock canyon continues like a corridor through a
mausoleum.  Very little vegetation grows in the hard ground.

[Ssleestaq] you could trigger yelling to landslides :)

few rocks~
Balanced precariously along the top edges of the canyon are several
sandstone rocks.  Though they vary in size, very few look ready to fall. 
Unfortunately, the ones that seem most ready are fairly large.  A good
gust of wind or a loud shout is liable to trigger an avalanche.
~
E
canyon walls~
Made of tan-colored sandstone, the walls of the twisting canyon curve
around, so it continues onward to the west and ends to the north, at the
end of Greened Way.  The canyon walls are pitted and worn, but appear
much too steep to climb.
~
E
1 west~
As the canyon walls twist and turn to the west, the land caught between
becomes covered with sand.  Whether the sand has worn off from the
sandstone walls or if it is naturally occurring is uncertain.
~
E
road rough uneven 1 north~
To the north lies part of a road.  The road looks extremely rough and
uneven, due, in fact, to the irregular terrain.  A lone pine tree grows
by the road to the north, near some hearty brown-green bushes.

@RA few large, sandstone rocks begin tumbling down in an avalanche!
