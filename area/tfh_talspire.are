Sleeping Quarters~
The interior of this thatched hut is clean and tidy.  Woven reed walls
allow fresh air to flow through the room, yet block the gustier winds
prevalent this high in the tree.  Simple furnishings have been placed at
the outer edges of the room, with a wooden bed and a sprawling headboard
occupying most of the space.  A squat pine desk sits near the bed, with
rounded knobs to open the drawers.

woven reed walls~
Strips of reeds have been pressed flat, dried, then woven into a
cross-hatch pattern to make a breathable wall, reinforced with wooden
beams sparsely framed throughout the hut.  Strands poke out where repairs
have been made, though they are hard to notice unless closely observed.

The furniture within the room is simple yet functional.  A wooden bed

brass lantern dangles from the ceiling, providing enough light to
illuminate the room.

Hallway~
Whisking along unabated, gusts of wind threaten to blow everything from
this expansive tree limb.  A passageway has been hollowed from the giant
teakwood tree to the south, easily broad and tall enough for the largest
ogre to walk through without stooping.  Thatched huts, made of woven
reeds, balance precariously on branches to the north and west, each one's
base reinforced with planks and ropes.  Wooden doors block entry into the
rudimentary buildings, with a square plaque displaying a different number
on each door.

expansive tree limb branches passageway hollowed giant teakwood~
Its trunk standing to the south, this inn has been built atop the
branches of a giant teakwood tree.  A passageway has been hollowed from
the center of the tree, allowing access to other branches, and back to
the ground.  Each expansive limb stretches out at least twenty feet
before forking off into thinner sections, growing lush with leaves.

E
thatched huts woven reeds bases planks ropes~
Dried reeds woven in an overlapping fashion, create a cross-hatched wall,
allowing circulation of air within the building, yet keeps larger gusts
of wind at bay.  Squared-off frames of wooden planks help maintain the
building's stability, although it sways slightly in the wind.  Loops of
rope secure the edges of the hut, preventing it from toppling over the
side of the wide branch.

Each thatched hut has a simple wooden door providing access to the

Winding Road - Valley's Edge~
A solitary copse of trees shades the road with its rising canopy. 
Eastward, the road heads towards a stone bridge; beyond its span the vale
lands spread out, a mixture of grasslands and marsh.  Westward, the trail
zigzags up the valley edge, climbing steeply up towards a rising wall of
trees.  A waystone rests against the trunk of one of the trees, its
surface covered with leaves and lichen.  To the south, a crumbling trail
descends slowly down the side of the vale.

solitary copse trees canopy~
Although the forest grows lush and full to the south, there is only a
single copse of trees shading this section of the road from the elements. 
Their limbs spread out in all directions, the leaves and branches closer
to the base of their trunks stripped off and carted away.

A pale gray stone bridge spans a rushing stream to the east.  Arching
over with only a slight curve, the stones have been reinforced with
wooden beams that poke out beneath their bases.

Road Across the Hills~
Cutting steeply across the hillside, a narrow dusty road follows the
curve of the slopes.  Rocks and debris lie scattered at its western edge. 
The road journeys eastward to a stone bridge and the grasslands,
spreading out beyond.  Westward, a forest covers the rolling hills, the
road zigzagging up the rise toward it.  In the distance to the north, a
huge spire of rock rises, dominating the northern horizon.

Road Across the Valley's Edge~
Dust swirls from the trail, blown about by the ever-present wind.  Just
over a wagon's breadth in width, the road clings to the side of the
valley, a few fissures near its edge an indication of its unstable nature. 
Below the track, a swath of grass and marsh spreads out, the road
crossing a stream via a single arched bridge before heading across the
basin land.  Northward, the trail continues to zigzag up the hillside,
towards a wall of trees, that form the edge of a massive forest.

Road Across the Valley's Edge~
Clinging to the edge of a crumbling cliff, the road makes its way slowly
along the vale's edge, dipping and weaving around rocks and ruts in its

the vale spreads out in a panoramic view, a marsh surrounding the edge of

At a particularly massive beech, the trail splits into three roads.  A
narrow track heads northward under the canopy of the great forest,
quickly disappearing into the gloom.  Eastward, the road begins a

Under the shade of the towering beeches, a narrow trail winds through the
forest.  Toadstools and wild flowers grow around the tangled roots,
carpeting the forest in splashes of gold, blues and reds.  A dusty black

mold and upon their tips a single droplet of nectar is suspended.  A

The forest to the west is blanketed in a mantle of gloom, very little
filtered light escaping the ancient beech trees' canopy of branches.  A

Forest Trail - West of the Great Spire~
To the east, a massive spire of rock looms skyward, dwarfing even the
ancient beeches.  Well over a hundred yards in height, it casts a wide
shadow across the landscape.  Throughout the woodlands, boulders lie
scattered, evidence that the wall of rock is unstable.  A fern-crowded
trail wanders through the forest in a north to south direction.

Beside a Huge Slip~
Around the spreading rubble from a massive landslide, a narrow path leads. 
Ferns and ivy grow under the towering beech trees, spreading fronds and
tendrils across the path.  To the east, dead trees thrust like broken
teeth from the mounds of rock and debris, their limbs and trunks torn
apart by the force of the falling stones.  A few stray boulders rest
beside the trail, scattered from their fall.  A healthy covering of
lichen makes its home across most of the debris.  To the south, the trail
heads away from the destruction, into the darkness of the dense forest. 
Eastward, the track makes a difficult journey across the slip's edge,
disappearing from sight between two jagged boulders.

Mounds of rocks and rubble have cascaded from the southern spire, gouging
a wide swath of forest apart as they fell.  Broken branches and shattered
tree trunks lie half buried in the slip, their dead foliage now covered
in brightly spotted toadstools and dusky brown fan-like fungi.  Moss and
lichen blanket the lower portion of the scree, as the forest reclaims
it's lost land.  The trail winds across the first tendrils of the slip
before heading in a more northerly direction to avoid the more unstable

plants' tiny leaves forming almost perfect circles.  Growing beside the
lichen are mounds of sphagnum moss, the dull-green plant thriving in the
damp conditions.

wildflowers~
A mixture of bluebells, daisies and dandelions make their home in the
forest glade.
~
E
bluebells~
Attached to a delicate stem are a cluster of blue bell-shaped flowers. 
Surrouding the graceful stems are slender green leaves.
~
E
daisy daisies~
Nestled amoungst the lush sphagnum moss, the jagged leaves of the daisy
plants would be lost but for bright white and yellow flowers, rising
above them on sturdy stems.
~
E
dandelions~
Thrusting through the carpet of moss are the jagged tips of the dandelion
leaves.  From the center of each plant, flower buds grow, a few mature
ones rising up on reed-like stems to blossom into a sunburst of yellow.
~
E
ribbons branches archway~
The branches of the beech trees bordering the path have been pulled
together and bound with a multitude of flapping gold and white ribbons. 
The majority of the looping, twisting strips seem to be moderately
weather-worn; however a few seem to be brand new, perhaps recently added.
~
E
boulder~
Worn smooth from countless years of exposure to the elements, the stone
would make a reasonable place to sit.  A lush layer of moss filled with
bright wildflowers cover most of its flanks.

Trail Through the Dark Woods~
The sickly trees crowd around the edge of the narrow path, clinging
branches tangle together overhead, forming a gloomy canopy.  Underfoot a
carpet of black moss spreads, its surface coated in droplets of
stagnant-smelling water.  Towards the west the trees appear to thin and
become increasingly healthy.

Beech trees mix with tall ferns around the trails edge, a few spots of
black-hued lichen covering some of the limbs, however the majority of the
trees appear to be healthy.  A light coating of broken shells cover the
path.  The smell of woodsmoke drifts in from somewhere to the north, its
source unseen.  A heavy coating of black-hued mold and moss spreads
eastwards, the trees appearing to be blighted and sickly.

Forest Trail - Wild Woods~
Just beyond the ivy, the trail narrows drastically.  Brambles, vines and
tangled branches encroach on the twisting path, making passage nearly
impossible.  Gnarled roots, overgrown with stinging nettles, break into
the rich surface loam, a threat to trip the unwary.  Ancient layers of
dead leaves and sticks blanket the forest floor; the smell of decay and
rot hangs heavy in the air.  The path continues on toward the east around
a particularly large oak, disappearing into the gloom beyond.

Forest Trail - Wild Woods~
The maples and oaks, common here in this ancient tangle of trees, begin
to give way to a few towering beeches.  The darkness beneath the canopy
deepens profoundly, making some sort of light source necessary at any
time of the day.  Underfoot, the undergrowth is so dense it's
impenetrable, the nettles and brambles so tightly intertwined passage off
the path is impossible.  To the west, a vast tree forces a sharp turn in
the path, but northward the trail twists and winds between the
close-growing trees.

The wild wood is nearly all beeches now, interspersed with fewer and fewer
of the other exotic trees.  The trail is little more than a ribbon of
earth, the forest giants flanking it interlocking branches overhead. 
Forest ferns and low clumps of red-ringed toadstools shelter beneath the
sturdier, more entangled brambles that span the empty spaces between
thick trunks.  The way curves back to the west toward even heavier growth.

The path is little more than a shallow indentation in the forest floor
here; traveling along it is slow and arduous where branches reach out to
grab and tug at exposed skin and clothing.  Nothing other than beech
trees appear along the trail, trunks so close together even brambles can
find little purchase there.  Gray moss hangs from some of the older
branches, looking like an old man's beard.  The air is musty, as if
undisturbed for ages.

Forest Trail - Near a Glade~
The path finally begins to widen again, the open spaces between the trees
filled with brambles and twisting vines.  Low clumps of forest daisies
line the path, their fragrance delicate and sweet, overriding the smell
of rotting leaves.  The beeches are ancient, majestic in their age and
size, the only remains of a long gone old growth forest.  Eastward the
trail opens into a sheltered glade dotted with bluebells and daffodils.

The walls of the bell tower are made from white-colored stone, expertly

white rope runs up through a hole in the floor disappearing through a
similar hole in the roof.

Well worn stairs wind around the outside of the circular chamber. 
Polished wooden floors gleam in the illumination produced by oil

into the middle of the roof is a square hole, less than a foot across. 
Dangling from the hole is a thick white rope, long enough to have several
feet coiled across the wooden floor.

Shrine~
The hall is bedecked with tapestries depicting a shimmering gold coin,
spinning on its edge.  Slender stone pillars rise up to support the
ceiling of dark wood covered with carvings of forest scenes, showing the
journey of a young man.  Before the door set into the northern wall is a
sandstone altar, carved with symbols of coins and clovers.  On top of the
altar are two silver candle sticks, their fat candles illuminating the
altar with a flickering golden light.  The stone floor underfoot is pale
grey and very clean, looking to have been recently swept or scrubbed. 
Benches along the sides of the room offer seating for worshippers to
listen to the daily sermons.  Above the archway to the west, the keystone
has been carved with a picture of an open book, while the eastern
archway's keystone has been carved with a picture of a scroll.  Along the
northern wall, draping down from the rafters, is a green and gold
tapestry, woven in a tartan pattern.

top of a green background.  Along the other walls are many other

ceiling carvings~
From south to north, the ceiling carvings detail the journey of a man
through adversity.  Starting in a small tavern, the man travels far
across the lands, into the hills and heavy forest of the wilderness,
getting himself completely lost.  Finally, the man sees a large rocky
spire illuminated by a heavenly light, and hastens to it.  Upon the site,
he finds an engraving of a spinning coin, and crows in triumph.  The
young man's attempts to build a temple on the site fail several times, so
he gathers an army of faithful followers from the southern lands to aid
him.  He returns with a dwarven hunter, and slowly more followers flock
to the raised banner.  Hundreds of people construct a temple on the rocky
spire, and a community grows up around the site.  Finally, at the extreme
northern end of the carvings, he dies in his sleep, an old man.
~

altar candles~
Made of one immense sandstone block, the altar dominates its section of
the room.  Someone has decorated its surface with scores of carvings,
dominated by the recurring symbols of clovers and coins, but most have
been worn down over a significant period of time.  Atop the altar sits a
pair of silver candle sticks, flickering with a golden light which
emanates from the tallow candles inside them.  Candle smoke drifts out
the large open doors to the south.

Chamber of Scriptures~
Richly polished wooden shelves line the walls of the chamber.  A carved
table sits in the middle of the room, cluttered with old faded
parchments, empty vials and dog-eared books.  Under the table, a faded
mat covers the floor, in such poor condition it is more holes than actual
cloth.  A copper candelabrum stands besides the western archway, the
beeswax candles dripping over the wooden floor.

Constructed of fine wood, the shelves are certainly sturdy, well
polished and stained darkly.  They, like all the furniture here,
would not look out of place in the finest mansion.
~
E
parchments dog-eared books table~
In the centre of the room rests a wooden table.  Seemingly carved from a
single piece of wood, it must have taken great skill, and a very large
tree, to make.  Strewn about the table are the tools of a scribe, ink
vials both empty and full, faded and pristine parchments, and dog-eared
books.
~
E
faded mat~
Examining the mat more closely, it appears to be extremely old and well
used, due to a large number of holes in the fabric.  It looks like the
mat's pattern used to be quite complex but is too hard to recognise with
the prevalent gaps in the weave.  In its current position beneath the
table, it looks like it has been placed as far from harm as possible,
while remaining as a part of the scenery.
~
E
copper candelabrum~
A tall, copper candelabrum stands next to the western archway.
It has been constructed for little aesthetic pleasure, as its heavy
structure indicates.  Beeswax from the candles has formed small hard
lumps of wax on the ground around the base of the candelabrum, and more
chunks stick to the shaft in several places.
~
E
ink vials~
Upon closer inspection, you notice that some of the vials are anything but
plain ink vials.  Some are inscribed with runes, others are not even made

Inner Sanctum~
Hanging from polished brass rings on the northern wall is a white
tapestry embroidered with a golden coin.  A rimu wood bed rests against
the western wall, while a writing desk and small bookcase have been
thrust against the eastern wall.  On the writing desk rest three silver
candle sticks, surrounded by empty ink vials.  Framing the tapestry are
two stained glass windows, depicting a woodland scene.  The left window
details the woods in winter, the right the same woods in summer.  Their
details are impressively clear, an indication to the craftperson's skill.

white tapestry brass rings golden coin~
A large white tapestry hangs from a series of brass rings on the northern
wall.  Of superior make and weave, there are no frayed threads on its
extravagent surface. In the middle of the tapestry is embroided a golden
coin with no clear markings on the visible face.  The weave looks more
like golden wire than dyed thread.
~
E
rimu bed~
Sitting against the western wall, the sturdy bed appears to be well made
from a deep rimu wood.  The frame of the bed is expertly crafted, but is
showing the signs of age, as small chips and dents are evident in the
frame.  The bedding, lying on top of the frame, is of a much lower
quality, and looks scruffy and crudely made.
~
E
writing desk bookcase~
Constructed of a common wood, the desk is pitted and scarred in many
places from use over the years.  Its surface is reasonably clean, only
taken up by three silver candle sticks, and some empty ink wells.  The
bookcase alongside the desk is small, and sturdily constructed from a
dark wood.  Books line its meagre shelves but the writing on the covers
seems to indicate that the books cover religion, crop rotation and public
speaking.
~
E
silver candlesticks~
Atop the desk's surface sit three candle sticks, each one bereft of a
usable candle. The candle stick holders have been completely clogged
with melted candle wax, and appear to need a good cleaning out to be
of any use.  The candle sticks themselves are well polished and, although
of low quality, have a good shine to them.
~
E
stained glass windows~
Both of the stained glass windows are of medium height, about five feet
high, and three feet wide.  The left window is tinted with white and blue
glass, and portrays the surrounding woodland areas in the full grip of
winter.  Snow hangs from the sparse trees, and paths lie furrowed through
the piled snowbanks.  The right window shows an identical view of the
woods, except the trees are in full flourish, the grounds are lush and
green, and the whole window is tinted with orange and red.

Top of the Bell Tower~
The circular chamber has been constructed out of white bricks, set with a
grey-colored mortar.  Overhead, a lattice of dark wood beams spread like
a spider's web.  In the center of the lattice, a heavy looking iron strut
supports a chunky iron chain attached to a sturdy bronze bell, bigger
than a halfling and twice as round.  Narrow rectangular windows, set in
each wall, offer a different view of the township and forests below.  Cut
into the red wood floor, a stone staircase winds its way downward to the
floor below.  A white rope runs from the bell chime through a hole
centered directly beneath it.

The beams form a wide lattice of interconnecting wood, similar in

~
E
windows~
Rectangular windows frame all sides of the bell tower, and offer a
panoramic view of the township and extensive forests below.  Hinged just
outside each portal, heavy latticed wooden shutters stand ready to
protect the bell tower from any serious gale.  The view through the
windows in each of the four cardinal directions would be one to be
admired.
~
E
rope chime~
From the top of the bell's chime, a white rope is lashed securely to a
bolt, and runs down through a small hole in the dead center of the floor. 
Signs of wear and tear are beginning to show on the rope's surface, and
the edges of the hole have been worn smooth.

E

Hanging down from the ceiling is a large, and extremely heavy looking
iron chain.  At its top, it is secured by an iron bolt, and dangles down
into the center of the room.  The bottom of the chain is fastened to a
massive cast bronze bell, which takes up most of the space in the bell tower.
Covering the surface of the bell are carvings, each one no larger than
three inches, and each contain symbolism pertinent to the clover and
coins.  In several places, the carved inscriptions are so worn and
weathered, they are illegible.

Talidar School~
Row upon row of books line shelves along all the walls except to the west. 
White oak writing desks stand in a cluster around the northern part of
the room.  An ornately carved lectern rests before the northern door, a
large open book resting upon it.  The air is dry and faintly musty, and
without any windows, the only illumination supplied by tallow candles
that splutter in brass sconces set jutting out from the shelves.  How the
parchments and books avoid catching fire from the precarious light source
is unclear.

Many of the tomes look extremely old and dog eared, while others look

~
E
writing desks~
The desks are of simple design and construction, providing a flat and
stable surface upon which to copy documents.  The top left corner of the
desks is angled up slightly, to provide an easier reading area for the
original document, while the rest of the desk forms a flat writing
surface.
~
E
lectern~
The lectern is made of a polished wood, the front of which is covered in
ornate carvings.  Numerous symbols, including a spinning coin, a broken
spear and a love heart, are inscribed into the facade.  Atop the lectern
lies a hefty tome, its pages crinkled with age, the edges torn and frayed. 
Covered in a sprawling handwritten script, the writing is quite
illegible, as it appears to have been scribed in someone's personal
shorthand.
~
E

Cast iron sconces jut from the shelves at several strategic locations. 
They seem to have been placed thusly to best shed the light of the tallow
candles over the room.  The sconces themselves are of simple design,
conical in shape.  Surrounding the candles is a cloud of smoke which
seems to dissipate quickly once away from the candles, yet a pungent
smell lingers throughout the room.

Private Room~
The room smells faintly of ionized metals and sulfurous fumes.  Cluttered
shelves line the walls, filled with all manner of bones, bottles and
crinkled parchment.  A heavy scarred table rests against the western
wall, coated in candle wax and scorch marks.  A narrow window in the
north offers a panoramic view of the lower town and beech forest beyond,
shrouded in wood smoke and mist.  Half buried in books is a low-slung
cot, unmade and probably unclean too.

A very large sturdy looking table, constructed of the same wood as the

Before the Temple~
Rising from the crest of Talidar's Spire is a two story building with a
bell tower attached.  A stone chip path leads up to the open double doors
of the structure; a tidy garden surrounds the path, filled with brightly
colored roses and slender foxgloves.  A less well-kept road leads from
the crest and down the rocky spire, heading into the township below.  A
weathered sign stands next to the path.

Stone chips lay a solid path up to the double doors of the temple. 
Ranging in size from six inches to two feet, they have been dug into the

The large wooden building lies directly to your north.  Fairly
nondescript, it has two floors and a belltower in the northwest corner of
the structure.  Constructed of a dark colored, sturdy wood, it appears to

~
E
garden roses foxgloves~
Despite the sparcity of fertile soil, the plants seem to be flourishing. 
Mounds of pea straw surround each rose cluster, adding much needed
nutrients.  In the shade of the building, stands of foxgloves grow; these
too appear remarkably healthy considering their growing conditions.  The
drone of insects fills the air, the sounds of tiny bees and flies darting
between the flowers.  Most of the flowers are gold and yellow in color,
with a few rogue, red blooms standing out.
~
E
road township~
Hacked from the rocky spire, the trail is little better than a goat track. 
Shallow steps have been worn into the rocks over time, making the path
down easier than a steep cliff, but the security of the footing looks
uncertain.  Ferns and immature beech saplings struggle to grow beside the
road, encroaching upon it in several locations.  The road zigzags down
the spire and fades from sight before reaching the township.  From here,
the predominately thatched houses seem to fade in the greenery of the
forest.  The occasional tall building breaks through, offering the
occupants a grand view.

Road Around the Temple~
The trail wanders around the top of the spire, ducking between shadowing
boulders and the crumbling cliff.  Tussock and the occasional fern grow
beside the road, adding a dash of color to the rocky landscape.  As the
path crest rises on its journey, it offers a panoramic view of the forest
and township below.  To the west, a two storied stone building with a
tower attached rises from the spire's plateau.

trail spire~
Little more than a goat track, the trail wanders across the rocky
prominence of the spire.  In the shadows of boulders, the path becomes
muddy, with a few dirty pools of water, forming in sheltered depressions
beside it.
~
E
boulders cliff~
Pockmarks and deep groves have been worn into the boulders by wind and
rain over many years.  Glinting against the dull earthern-colored stone
are seams of quartz, exposed by the erosion.  The crumbling cliff spirals
downward toward the south; a fall from this height would surely be fatal. 
Growing in the scarred surface are diminutive ferns, clinging to their
perch with tangled roots.
~
E
tussock fern~
Covered with a light dusting of drying mud and rock, the tawny tussock
plants struggle to grow in the shallow soil of the spire.  In the shade,
small ferns flourish, dead and dying fronds spreading from their crowns
like the twisted ribcage of a dying beast.
~
E
two story building~
The two story building rests on the highest point of the spire.  A
slender tower rises from its sloping roof, the windows at the top
offering a great view of the surrounding lands.  Around the base of the
structure, rose gardens have been planted, their perfumed blooms filling
the air with sweet smells.
~
E
panaramic view forest township~
From the advantage of the spire's crest, the forest surrounding the spire
can be seen, spreading out toward the horizon in all directions bar south. 
Southward, the forest thins and is replaced with grasslands and rolling
hills.  A few thatched and tiled roofs below can be seen through the
woodlands to the east, the haze of woodsmoke hanging above of them.

Fork in the Road~
The goat track of a road forks at a white stone boulder, one trail
heading across the spire toward a grove of trees, while the other
descends sharply toward the township.  Rough steps have been cut into the
roadway, allowing for better footing than the mud, stone and tussock
would normally allow, but even so, the descent does not look very
pleasant.

A few speckles of quartz cover the weather worn boulder's surface. 
Unlike the rest of the spire, the stone is a dull cream coloration,
turning almost pure white at the exposed edges.  Cut into the boulder's
face are swirly patterns, forming into a linked @ecross@n of lines.  Deep
scuff marks around the base of the boulder seem to indicate that it has
been moved recently.

A stand of white teak trees grow beside a narrow pool, flax and rushes

A few red tiled roofs can be seen through the dense canopy of beech trees. 
Surounding the township to the east is a hazy cloak of woodsmoke.  The

Cut into the crumbling rock are shallow steps, little over half a foot
deep.  The edges of the steps have been worn smooth, probably a
combination of rain and use, leading to their condition.

Shady Grove of Trees~
The spire dips into a basin depression, where a grove of white teak trees
grow.  In the center of the basin is a crescent-shaped pool, surrounded
by bullrushes and flax bushes.  A narrow path heads eastward into the
grove and around the pool, while a muddy trail winds southward across the
spire.  Through the trees to the west, a two story building rises, a tall
bell tower overlooking its tiled roof.

Lining the pool are an abundance of flax bushes and bullrushes.  The flax
bushes, a green bush with scores of long leaves emerging directly from
the ground, are lush and look very healthy.  In several places, the flax
has been cut down to provide easy access to the pool.  Bullrushes are
scattered among the flax bushes, its deep brown color complimenting the
dark green of the flax leaves.
~

Forming a circle around a depression in the ground, white teak trees grow
in a grove around a small calm pool.  The trees look healthy and thanks
to their arrangement and branches, little wind blows through into the
grove within.

crescent pool~
Stretching out across the basin is a calm pool of water.  Its surface is
still and peaceful, in stark contrast to the muddy trails leading up to
it.  On every side of the pool, bullrushes and flax bushes line the
shore, making the entire pool appear to be much lower in the ground than
the area around it.
~
E
muddy trail~
The shallow soil has been churned into a muddy trail from countless
people, and even a few animals wandering to and from the crescent-shaped
pool.  Scattered across the worst of the mire is rotting straw, perhaps
an attempt to stabalize the footing.
~
E
two story building bell tower~
To the west, the top of a two story building juts out over the trees.  It
looks to be predominantly made of a white stone, and quite old.  On the

and stretches skyward to become the highest point of the spire.

Grove of Trees - Crescent Pool~
The path ends at a tall stand of bullrushes, growing at the water's edge.
Sparking ripples spread out across the crescent-shaped pool, perhaps
stirred by the wind or unseen fish.  Shading the tranquil pool are tall
teak trees, their leafy branches drooping low, some even touching the
water.  Intermingled amongst the trees and bullrushes are stands of flax,
flourishing in the damp, muddy ground.

Forming a small grove is a circle of teak trees, growing healthily by the

Flax grows in abundance in this area, thriving off the wet conditions. 
The teak trees form a windbreak, and the muddy ground enables the flax to
flourish.  Because of excellent growing condtions, the flax has taken
over much of the area around the grove.

Tracks, both human and beast, lead up to and away from the quiet pool

Dipping down between two boulders, the path begins its descent toward the
township and forest canopy.  Weatherworn steps have been cut into the

Across the spire's jagged surface, the road runs level with the canopy of
the beech forest.  Birds and small animals move in the branches,
searching for food and sheltering from larger predators.  Smooth stone

Overgrown Path Around the Temple~
Overgrown with rough bushes and tussock, the narrow path winds east to
west before a stone, two story building.  Westward, a rusty wrought iron
gate hangs from a crooked post.  A copse of willow trees grows beyond the
gate, shrouding the area in gloom.  Rising out of the tussock between the

You can just make out a faint trail winding down the cliff face to the
west.

Spire Road - Forest Intersection~
Overhead the canopy of branches thins, allowing in glimpses of the sky. 
Three trails intersect each other here, circling a wide, flat tree stump,
before continuing onward.  Bright red-capped toadstools fan out from the
rotting bark of the stump, forming an almost perfect faerie ring.  Two
waystone has been set upon the many-ringed top of the stump, an arrow
carved across the stone's surface pointing westward and to the east.  A
muddy trail heads southward, in a slight decline, while a wider and drier
path heads to the east, winding through the forest.  A narrow path
ascends a wide ridge of rock, heading towards a barely visible jutting
spire some way to the west.

Forest Trail - Slow Descent~
A wall of stacked stones parallels this muddy trail along its eastern
edge, creating a barrier between the path and the nearby forest.  To the
south, the forest begins to thin, with occasional tree stumps indicating
that some deforestation has taken place in recent times.  The smell of
burning wood drifts through the air, although its source cannot be
detected from here.  Along the western edge of the trail, the ground
suddenly drops away, the steep fern-covered bank almost hidden by the
masses of dense foliage.

Road in the Beech Forest~
Young beeches grow in tight clusters around the winding forest trail. 
Older, more solid beech trees spread their branches out, forming a canopy
of green and brown.  To the south, an ancient tree has fallen, cutting a
wide swath of forest as it fell.  In the tree's wake countless slender
saplings have begun to grow, racing to fill the fallen giant's space. 
Sphagnum moss covers much of the tree, leaving only the splayed roots and
some broken branches uncovered.

Shattered branches lie beside the split trunk of the ancient tree.  In

Under the canopy of the old beech trees wind several dusty trails.  A
waystone marks the intersection of the three trails, an arrow pointing

Narrow Trail~
Little more than a goat trail, the overflourish in the fertile soil path
winds steadily northward.  Old man's beard drapes down from the ancient
beech branches, striving to smother the trees.  Across the forest floor,
a carpet of bracken and ferns flourish in the fertile soil.  Rising out
of the sea of ferns are scraggly shrubs and slender beech saplings. 
Southward, the trail appears to widen a bit, perhaps intersecting other
roads.

E
old man's beard~
Strangling the beech trees in their tough vines, the old man's beard is
clearly, an unwelcome pest.  Under its grasp, the trees have begun to
wither, leaves turning brown well before they should.  Creamy-white seed
heads cover the vines, ready to spread the weed across the forest.
~
E

Under the mantle of old man's beard, the ancient trees are struggling to
survive.  At the canopy level, the normal webwork of leaves is absent,
replaced by a tangle of vines and skeletal branches.  The trees wide
roots spread out across the ground, forming a intricate webwork of
tendrils.  Between the various gaps, ferns and bracken flourish.

Probably home to countless wetas and other insects, the fields of bracken

Related to grasshoppers and crickets the mottled-colored weta live and
feed amongst the bracken.  Their hind legs are covered in a row of
spines, their best defence against hungry birds.  Slender antenae that
reach three times the body lenght tap the ground around them, useful for
locating danger and food in the darkness of the forest floor.  Tiny
rainbow-hued beetles scuttle through the leaf-litter, their antenae
waving.

Before a Stone Building~
A squat yet sprawling building stands to the east, one wing of the
structure stretching behind a quaint country house to the southeast. 
Waves of heat pour from the building, emanating from a blazing forge
built just inside of the entrance.  Simple stone columns support a roof
of gray shale, each sheet set in perfect precision next to one another. 
The side walls of the edifice around the forge only rise halfway up the
columns, allowing the breeze to blow through the perpetually hot workshop. 
A pair of razor-sharp polearms criss-cross in the air above the doorway,
indicating a @Gweaponsmith@n has made his services available within.  A
roadway extends to the north and south between the buildings, with a
wooden @yfence@n preventing travelers from trampling a clearing in the forest
to the west.

Beech Forest Crossroads~
Four roads intersect before a sizeable stone and wood building. 
Northward, the road heads toward a thatched house and beyond, into the
dense forest.  Eastward, the trail opens into a clearing, with a circular
stone well in its center.  To the west, the path meaders between old
beech trees before disappearing from view.  The road ends before the
two-storied building to the south.

Before An Oddly-Constructed Inn~
To the south, a jumble of buildings have been built in and around a grove
of white teak trees.  The main structure is the only one that looks
well-constructed, its gray stone exterior painted with white-wash. 
Patches of light gray mortar are visible between the stones, where
repairs to the walls have been made.  The rest of the dilapidated inn
appears to have been added haphazardly with whatever materials were
available at the time of expansion.  Dirty boulders and wooden boards of
various shapes and colors overlap each other to form additional rooms,
each added section looking as if it could fall apart at any time. 
Sprouting through the center of the roof of the primary building is a
gigantic teak tree, its branches supporting walkways and thatched huts
high in the air.  An archway leads into the @Cinn@n to the south, and a
trail to the north leads directly to a crossroads in the forest.

An enormous teak tree soars into the sky along the western edge of the

across.  Higher in the sky, thatched huts perch precariously upon
sprawling branches, with walkways leading from the trunk to each hut. 
There is no visible access to the huts from here.

Cliff Face - Surrounded by Lupins~
The jaggard cliff spirals downwards, the constant clatter of pebbles
bouncing down its rough side fills the air.  Lupins encircle the area,
their yellow flowers filling the air with a rich scent.  Oddly, the
southern rocks appear to be worn smooth, and have a few indentations cut
into them, almost like handholds, although only a gnome would find their

A Narrow Shelf - Clinging to a Cliff~
Damp moss clings to the crumbling side of the cliff face, dripping waters
and algae combine to make the surface dangerously slippery.  A few
scraggly beech saplings grow in the fork of rock, bent and twisted from
their precarious existence.  A narrow shelf of rock continues eastward,
suprisingly clear of rubble and easly traversible.  Overhead, shallow
handholds have been cut into the rocks, allowing a skilled climber a
chance to ascend towards the spire's peak.

A Narrow Shelf - Before a Cave Mouth.~
The northern wall of the cliff face splits at a long fissure draped with
scraggly, velvet-textured moss.  The southern drop appears have been worn

Inside the Narrow Cave~
Tendrils of moss hang like stalactites from the cave's ceiling.  A
trickle of water drips from them to form a shallow pool upon the floor. 
Across the limestone walls, an unknown artist has painted ochre colored
animals and hand prints.  A modest campfire burns in a firepit in the
centre of the cave.  Animal skins have been strewn around the floor
surrounding the pit.  Innumerable fetishes and wards, made from sticks,
bones and other animal parts hang from the ceiling.  To the south, a
narrow fissure leads out of the cave.  A mound of rubble covers much of
the northern wall, remnants of a recent cave-in.

Before a Crumbling Cliff~
Ferns and bullrushes, spread out around the base of the cliff.  A jumbled
collection of broken rocks and debris have fallen from its crumbling
face, forming a drier rise on which to stand.  Cut into the cliff side
are shallow indentations, perhaps @ehand holds@n that could make ascending
its broken surface possible.  Through the stands of rushes, a muddy trail
winds, shallow pools of dirty water spreading out on either side of it. 
To the east, the ground is a quagmire of stagnant pools and rotting
vegetation; beyond the marsh a dense forest of beech trees begins,
blocking any view of what lies beyond.  Southward, the marsh extends
onward, ferns and flax bushes mixing with bullrushes, and the occasional
papyrus stand.

Crossed Paths~
This trail winds its way through the trees, leading towards what appears
to be the forest's edge.  Just beyond the treeline, flax bushes and
bulrushes flourish, a hint of the presence of a nearby marsh.  Nestled
between two old oak trees, a stone building with a red tile roof
lies to the west.  Rotting piles of dead leaves and fallen branches lie
scattered along the tiles, slowly decomposing in the slightly humid air. 
Alongside the building is an enormous pile of cut wood, neatly stacked
and covered with a heavy canvas tarp.  The visage of a finely crafted
crested helm and emblazoned shield have been engraved into the wooden
door, highlighted with thin strands of beaten silver around their edges. 
A shiny metal @Cplaque@n, affixed to the wall near the portal, has writing
etched into its surface.

forest's edge treeline flax bushes bullrushes marsh~
Interspersed between the trees are flax bushes and bulrushes, obscuring
most of the view of what lies beyond.  The leaves of the trees block most
of the elements from reaching the forest floor, dropping the temperature
a few degrees.
~
E
old oak trees~
Two oak trees stand sentinel outside of the armory, one on each corner
facing the pathway that runs to the north and south through the forest. 
Each tree grows at least five feet taller than the others nearby, and
their bark shows scars from the building's creation.

The red-tiled roof covering this stone building slopes slightly, enough

smell mixing with the smoky haze, drifting from within the armory.

The wooden door has been created by a mastercraftsman, the detail used in
its creation life-like.  Projecting from the center of the door is a
triangular shield, its base point stretching halfway to the ground. 
Emblazoned across its breadth is a coat of arms, although the family it
belongs to is unknown.  Resting on top of the shield is the visage of a
crested helmet, the painted plume enticing viewers to touch it.  Tracing
every edge is a beaten strip of silver, emulating shadows and depth
within the carving.

Path Through the Beech Forest~
Ancient beech trees spread their twisted branches skyward, shrouding the
winding path in gloom.  Under their gnarled roots lie mounds of leaf
litter, a few spotted toadstools feasting on the decay.  Westward, the
road bends around a moss-covered boulder and heads north.  To the east,
the trail leads from the lush forest towards a crossroad.  Brightly
colored ribbons hang from an archway of woven branches, lying southward. 
A small flower-filled glade lies just beyond the opening.

E
ancient beech trees twisted branches~
The solid-looking beech trees stretch skyward, their gnarled branches
forming a matted canopy that greedily seeks any light.  Their solid
trunks are covered in a rough red-hued bark that provides reasonable
protection from pests and minor damage.
~
E
path trail crossroad~
Despite being covered in the tendrils of beech tree roots and a generous
layer of leaf litter, the trails are in reasonable condition.  Flanked by
ferns and the occasional boulder, they are clearly a faster route to
travel than blazing a trail through the forest itself.
~
E
gnarled roots mounds leaf litter~
The beech trees require a massive root system to support their towering
bulk.  Due to the crowded growing conditions, many of the tree's roots
interweave, forming a tangled lattice along the ground.  Mounds of damp
leaf litter blanket the soil, brightly capped toadstools spreading across
them.
~
E
toadstools~
Spreading across the leaf litter, the tiny fungi look like a miniature
forest.  Droplets of dew on the dusky-orange caps bend the delicate
stems, giving the toadstools twisted and bent.  The smell of decay hangs
over the mounds, giving the area with a rich, earthen aroma.
~

Covered in a lavish layer of dense moss, the boulder has all but
disappeared against the forest backdrop.  The little amount of stone
still visible have been worn smooth, to the point where it practically

Winding Road Near the Forest's Edge~
Surrounded by broken crates and rusty wagonwheels is a squat building,
its entrance open to all, with no door barring passage inside. 
Whitewashed stones and a tiled roof are clean and well tended, although
the littered ground around the building has received very little
maintenance.  Weeds and wildflowers grow sporadically, poking up through
the termite infested debris.  A well-traveled path winds around a
weatherworn boulder and ascends northward, while another trail heads off
to the west, leading into the forest.  There is @Ga sign@n afixed to the
wall next to the entrance.

Wooden crates, once used to house supplies, lie scattered around the

Wagonwheels with snapped spokes lean over the wooden debris, their outer

from the pile of junk.

Standing only seven feet tall, this building is shorter than most of the

Forest Trail~
Heading in an east-west direction, the forest trail is flanked by the
lush undergrowth of the woods.  Ferns and five-finger shrubs dominate the
plant life here, far outnumbering the ancient beech trees.  Westward, the
path slopes in a gentle decent, winding between stands of saplings before
disappearing from sight.  To the east the trail narrows, overgrown with
the bountiful forest's plant life.

forest trail lush undergrowth~
The forest of ferns and tree roots crowd around the forest trail, almost
obscuring it completely at several points.  Growing between the mighty
beeches are five-finger bushes, named after their distinctive leaves. 
Dark black-red berries sprout on woody stems of the bushes;, the lack of
birds feeding upon them suggests that they might be poisonous.
~
E
ancient beech trees~
Stretching upward to form the intricate forest canopy, the ancient
beeches must be hundreds of years old.  Near the bottoms, the branches
are gnarled and twisted with few leaves, but higher up, they appear
healthier and covered with the tiny serrated leaves.

The stout trunks of the saplings rise toward the gaps in the canopy.  A

Forest Trail~
Rubble surrounded boulders rise out from the fern covered ground.  Moss
and lichen cover much of their weather-worn surface.  The beech trees
grow closely packed in around the boulders, shrouding the area in gloom. 
Winding around several larger stones is a leaf covered path, heading in a
southwesterly direction.  A three-foot tall wooden fence has been built
along the east side of the path, stretching north along the roadway on
the other side.

Huragar's Armory~
Sturdy ironwood beams support a thin roof of overlapping red tiles, the
intricately constructed rafters set in an eye-catching criss-crossed
pattern.  Dense boulds, cemented together with a pasty-white mortar, form
the walls, accenting an immense stone and iron forge that burns brightly
at the back of the building.  A short wooden platform, covered with dust
and scuff marks, leads up to a solid oak counter, behind which the
armorer toils away at his craft.  A steel funnel at the crest of the
ceiling whisks away most of the drifting smoke from the forge, although a
light haze remains in the air.  Stacks of uncut, treated leather and
various ingots rest against the wall behind the counter, awaiting a
customer's order.

Gray ironwood beams span the ceiling from wall to wall, criss-crossed in
mid-air and tied off with lengths of leather straps.  The beams help

Herbalist's Residence~
This quaint country home is dazzling to the eye, with splashes of natural
color on all sides.  Scores of clay pots, storing dried herbs and pressed
flowers, line shelves built along the walls, each jar individually
painted with a lifelike depiction of its contents.  A series of
latticework dividers stand near the rear of the home, with countless
sprigs of all sorts poking out from behind them in every which direction. 
Glass vials have been wedged between some of the gaps, their remedial
contents fermenting before being offered for sale.  A mortar and pestle
rests on the counter, set down in the middle of a task as a yellow
powder, too coarse to be used in a potion, lies within the bowl.  A
horseshoe has been nailed over the entranceway to the west, perhaps to
keep this home in good fortune.

Weaponsmith's Forge~
Built into the northern wall is a stone forge, intensely hot with blazing
coals roasting within.  The walls rise up only halfway to the ceiling,
allowing a gusty draft to whisk away the oppresive heat.  Weaponcrafting
tools dangle down from the ceiling by leather straps, their surfaces
well-worn from use.  Stacks of split wood for the fire rest against the
southern wall far away from the forge, kept covered by a canvas tarp to
prevent embers from drifting into the dry kindling.  To the east appears
to be a weapon shop, where racks display the glorious weapons crafted in
this smoky workshop.  A narrow roadway passes by outside to the west,
running perpendicular to the building's front.

stone forge blazing coals roasting 1 north~
A massive forge has been solidly constructed into the north wall, its
pale stone charred and stained from countless hours of use.  Large coals
blaze white with incandescent heat inside, the air nearby wavering from
the sheer intensity of the heat.

Tongs, hammers, chisels and other tools of the weaponcrafting trade hang
from the ceiling by thick leather straps.  Their polished steel surfaces
are scratched and charred, but seem to still be in fine condition.

stacks split wood canvas tarp dry kindling 1 south~
A stained beige canvas tarp covers a large pile of firewood stacked
against the south wall.  Sticks of uniformly-sized hardwood sit beneath
the tarp, protected from any stray sparks or embers that may fly from the
forge.  A few small holes dot the surface of the tarp, as though it
snagged repeatedly on a sharp end of something.

Weaponsmith's Storefront~
Spacious and open, the weapon shop looks very clean and professional. 
Teakwood weapons racks line the walls, each one filled with weapons
polished to a gleaming lustre.  Business must be extremely good, as a
solid oak cabinet with precious glass panes stands in one corner,
displaying customized polearms waiting for their new owners to arrive.  A
pair of woven tapestries flank an open window at the back of the shop,
looking out into the forest.  Above a plain wooden door to the north is a
bundle of arranged wildflowers, lending a woman's touch to the decor.

teakwood weapons racks walls polished gleaming lustre~
Beautifully crafted racks of teakwood cover the walls, the weapons
filling them equally as well made.  Deeply etched scrawls cover the outer
surfaces of the racks, adding visual spice to an otherwise plain item. 
The weapons have been crafted from various materials, each appearing to
be of the highest quality.
~
E
solid oak cabinet precious glass customized polearms~
Standing proudly in one corner is a tall oak cabinet.  Four rectangular
panes of glass make up each window, and the wood framing the glass is
elaborately carved.  The feet of the cabinet resemble the feet of a
mythological beast, and the finials rising from each of the four corners
look similarly exotic.  Inside, several polearms stand on their butt
ends, light catching on the wickedly sharp blades.  A tiny piece of metal
is visible on the inside of the cabinet behind the handles, and it glows
slightly, evidence of a magical lock.
~
E
pair woven tapestries flank open window forest back 1 east~
Two bright tapestries flank the window.  One has been woven in warm
colors: red, orange, yellow and white.  It bears a geometric design, that
could almost resemble a sunset if one applied enough imagination.  The
second tapestry bears threads of the cooler colors: green, blue, purple
and black.  A more abstract design has been woven into this tapestry, yet
it could possibly resemble the starry sky over a vast expanse of water. 
Beyond the window, trees grow nearby in a forest.
~
E
plain wooden door bundle arranged wildflowers decor 1 south~
Gathered together in a blue silk ribbon, this large bouquet of
wildflowers adds more color to the room.  Daisies, violets, bluebells,
and other flowers show around the edges, their petals not yet beginning
to wilt.  The edge of the ribbon is slightly frayed, as though it has
been in use for a long time.

Common Room~
Pine floorboards have been covered with sawdust, attempting to mask a
fishy smell that permeates the room.  The owners of this establishment
have invested a lot more money into the furnishings than the building
that houses it, as streaks of grime mar the whitewashed walls.  A long
crescent-shaped oak bar stretches across the southern end, with wooden
stools lined up along its length.  Latticework shelves stand behind the
bar, filled with bottles of beer and wine.  The west end of the room has
been built up against the side of a giant tree, where a curved opening
leads into a chamber cut from its heart.  A @ydoorway@n leads further
into the inn to the south, and an archway exiting the inn is visible to
the north.

pine floorboards sawdust 1 down~
The floorboards are of uniform width, neatly interlocking across the
surface of the floor.  Sawdust has been liberally dusted across their
surface, and seems to have permanently settled into the cracks.  A few
scratches and scuffs mar the exposed surface of the floor, but apart from
that it seems to be in good shape.
~
E
streaks grime whitewashed walls~
The walls must have been whitewashed rather long ago, as they are more
grey than white.  Streaking vertically down the surface of the wall, many
of the grimy areas seem to be shaped like a small hand, as though a
drunken gnome fell into a fireplace and tried to put it out by punching a
wall.  Other dirt on the wall seems to be congealed grease, encrusted
dirt and dried blood.
~
E
long crescent-shaped oak bar southern wooden stools~
Made of carefully-planed oak, this sweeping crescent-shaped bar blocks
off the southernmost area of the room.  Dings, scratches and gouges cover
its surface, testament to the amount of use it gets.  The stools tucked
underneath its edge seem to be sturdily crafted, each bearing the scars
of a past brawl.
~
E
latticework shelves bottles beer wine~
A solidly-constructed latticework shelf unit rests on the floor behind
the bar, holding multiple bottles of alcohol.  Toward the bottom are
dusty, dark bottles of wine, their mouths covered in fine wire mesh. 
Further up is the wine that looks like it would cost half as much, and
resting above that are brown bottles of ale and beer.  The latticework
itself is built of some dark wood, and looks as though it might be
relatively new.
~
E
side giant tree curved opening chamber heart 1 west~
A tall doorway with an arched top has been cut into the tree's side to
the west, allowing entrance the part of the building located inside. 
The edges have been sanded down to a very smooth finish, and the wood
looks as though its been oiled recently, to protect the surface.  The
bark seems to have been mostly gouged away, yet a few shreds remain on
the tree.
~
E
archway exit 1 north~
A tall portal has been cut into the north wall, the top arching
gracefully.  The edges have been sanded down to a fine, smooth surface,
and the wood has been oiled to help preserve the finish.  A few dings and
scratches mar the opening nonetheless, but otherwise the wood is in fine
shape.

Stairwell Inside a Giant Tree~
Cut into the heart of a massive teak tree, this chamber looks extremely
cramped and stuffy.  A spiraling staircase is carved from the outer edge
of the wood, leading further up the enormous trunk.  Somehow surviving
the intrusion, stubby branches are beginning to grow from exposed knots
along the ceiling.  An oak desk sits in the center of the room facing the
arched entrance to the east, where an aristocratic-looking man in
fashionable trousers and a silk shirt works feverishly on a tall stack of
paperwork.

Although the trunk of the tree is enormous in breadth, this chamber cut
from the heartwood of the still-living wood is somewhat cramped and
stuffy.  The spiraling staircase and oak desk occupy most of the
available space, with just enough room to walk around without bumping
into something.

Cut directly out of the heartwood, a spiraling staircase rises up further

Cut out from the heartwood of a still-living tree, this chamber has tiny
branches with closed buds protruding from old knots that remain near the
ceiling, out of reach from the maintenance crew.  Knife marks closer to
the ground indicate where other branches have been cut off recently.

Inside the Tree - The Second Story~
A winding staircase ascends and descends through the heartwood of the old
beech.  Despite this intrusion, the tree still lives, a few branches
baring full-grown green leaves, and budding ones.  A rich gum and wood
smell hangs in the air, more pleasant than the normal stale ale smell of
the typical tavern.  Above the door to the east, a bunch of wildflowers
have been hung.  Northward, a hallway continues through the inn, a few
bobbing lanterns lighting the way.  The hustle and bustle of the inn
echos up from below.

Carved from the living wood of the tree, the smooth steps allow passage

Sleeping Quarters~
The interior of this thatched hut is clean and tidy.  Woven reed walls
allow fresh air to flow through the room, yet block the gustier winds
prevalent this high in the tree.  Simple furnishings have been placed at
the outer edges of the room, with a wooden bed and a sprawling headboard
occupying most of the space.  A squat pine desk sits near the bed, with
rounded knobs to open the drawers.

Kitchen~
A clutter of pots and pans have been stacked across the scarred surface
of a solid oak bench.  A circular fire pit glows with burning coals,
similar to a forge, several iron spits lying beside it.  The roof and
rafters are covered in smoke stains from the fire pit below.  Hanging
above the bench is a collection of knives and ladles, below which sit a
chalkboard sign.  Beside the southern door is an ornate rack, filled with
ceramic jars, clay bowls, and wooden platters.

A Muddy Yard~
Spreading southwards is a sizable yard, a wooden fence encircling it on
all sides bar the north, where the jumbled inn stands.  A quagmire of mud
has been covered with mounds of straw, in an attempt to make the yard
more navigable.  Against the eastern fence a lemon tree grows, its dark
green leaves soaking up the sunlight.  Beside the tree a couple of planks
have been nailed on top of a brace set into the fence.  Somewhat cleaner
straw has been bundled beneath to create a makeshift shelter for the
chickens.  A wide flight of stairs leads up to a solid-looking wooden
door to the north, the smell and sound of cooking emanating from it.

Against the eastern wall rests a stout wooden bed, a jumble of woolen

forest of beech trees.  Squat beeswax candles rest in a pool of dried wax
on a white wooden desk, resting under the southern window.  A door in the

Spreading across the inn's roof are the massive branches of the gigantic
tree.  Wooden huts have been built at the end of several of the wider
ones, using both the living tree and dead wood for their construction
material.  A blustery northern wind whips across the rooftop, tugging at
branches and thatching.  Below the forest spreads out, a few buildings

Despite its stout apperance, the branch sways slighty in the northern
wind, increasing the difficulty of traveling along it.  Two round huts
constructed from woven reeds and encased in living beech branches, sit to
the east, their thatched roofs covered in ivy and leaves.  To the west an
arch cut into the trunk of the tree leads back towards the inn.

branch~
The top of the branch has been smoothed flat, forming a walkway.  Despite
the distortions the branch has endured, it remains alive, as if some
arcane forces were used to shape the wood.  Every yard, branches on both
sides of the main walkway rise upwards to form a ribcage-like fence,
forming handholds for the less dextrous.  An archway at base of the
branch leads back into the main trunk of the massive tree.
~
E
hut woven reeds thatched ivy leaves~
The woven reeds are a dull brown in coloration, dry and reasonably water
tight.  Bands of bamboo form an outer layer of suporting struts to give
the hut some stablity.  Across the thatching, a tendril or two of
red-leaved ivy flourishes, helping to secure the wind blown roof.

Branched Walkway - Before a Hole~
A sizable branch spreads southward from the massive tree.  An archway
allows the daring to walk upon the branch leading toward a circular hut. 
Nestled among the branches to the south, the thatched hut's walls and
roof are constructed from bundles of reeds.  The living branches of the
teakwood tree form a natural windbreak.

Sleeping Quarters~
The interior of this thatched hut is clean and tidy.  Woven reed walls
allow fresh air to flow through the room, yet block the gustier winds
prevalent this high in the tree.  Simple furnishings have been placed at
the outer edges of the room, with a wooden bed and a sprawling headboard
occupying most of the space.  A squat pine desk sits near the bed, with
rounded knobs to open the drawers.

General Store~
The interior of this sparsely-decorated shop is clean and tidy, with
various goods tightly packed along one another within the close
confines of this squat building.  Barrels of flour lie stacked upon one
another in one corner, their metal bands vigorously polished to a dull
gleam.  Drooping canvas and burlap bags dangle from hooks along one
wall, each one meticulously hung and ready to be filled with whatever
provisions one might wish to store within them.  A shiny silver bucket
rests on top of a smooth wooden countertop, filled to the brim with
freshly wrapped torches, their oil-soaked tips still dripping.  A row of
shiny brass lanterns hang from the rafters, casting a wave of
illumination that is almost blinding in intensity.

Whitewashed walls show nary a trace of dust nor dirt, evidently well

supporting the tiled roof appear to be spotless, such is the level of
cleanliness.  Very little decoration adorns the shop, the only personal
touch being a shiny silver bucket that stores the torches on the
countertop.

Barrels of flour occupy most of the space behind the counter, forcing the

Four barrels marked as containing flour lie stacked in pyramid pattern in
one corner of the tiny shop, occupying the most space of any of this

with nary a speck of the precious flour coating the floor.  Each of the
tight bands holding the barrels together has been rubbed until it gleams,

Empty canvas and burlap bags dangle from a row of hooks along the
southern wall, hanging by their drawstrings with regular precision.  Most
of the bags are in immaculate shape, although patches and replacement
stitches are visible on some.  There is no doubt that each bag would
reliably hold its goods inside without spilling.

Sticky black gobs of oil glisten on the tips of scores of wooden torches,

great pains to make sure none of the droplets stain his wooden countertop.

Forest's Edge - Steep Bank~
The winding trail weaves between the last of the ancient beeches and
begins a sharp decent down a crumbling bank.  Mixing in with the forest
ferns are brightly colored wildflowers, flourishing in the scattered
clearings.  A brisk wind from the north carries a damp, musty smell with
it.  Mounds of decaying leaf litter lie in piles under the trees, perhaps
swept from the roadway.  A weathered @esign@n is affixed to a nearby

A few stands of beech trees grow in isolated copses across the grassy
valley floor.  The road to the west heads down a steep bank into the

Marshy ground surrounds the hard packed road on either side.  An
occasional breeze or disturbance by wildlife stirs up the smell of decay
and stagnant water.  Speckled through the swampland are stands of beech
trees, the vanguard of the eastern forest's edge.  The road itself has
been build slightly above the wet grounds, across a causeway that winds
in a southwesterly direction.  Eastward, the road heads up the vale's

the north and more dry lands to the south.  To the west, a stone bridge
rises out of the vegetation, the road winding its way toward it.  The

Winding Road - In the Shadows of Jagged Cliffs~
Crumbling and broken rocks lie scattered across the road, fallen from the
cliff face rising to the east.  The hillside ascends upward from the
cliff, still forested, but more broken stones and tussock intermix with
the trees.  Southward, the grasslands of the vale spread out toward the
horizon, while west and north stands of reeds give a good indication the
ground is marshy.  The road continues to the south for a while longer,
before winding westwards toward a stone bridge, arching through the
grasses.

Winding Road Across the Vale~
Tumbling from the eastern cliff face, a slip of rocks has cascaded down,
forming a wide, jagged barrier of debris.  The winding road bends
westward to avoid the rock slide, and heads out across the grassy vale. 
Northward, the road skirts the cliff face, scattered stones covering its

Winding Road Across the Vale~
Grass sways in the light breezes beside the dusty road.  The wind scoops
up the dust, sending billowing clouds swirling into the air.  Westward,
the road winds toward a stone bridge across a ribbon-like river.  To the
east, the road leads toward broken cliffs and forested hills.  Stands of
rushes and flax grow to the north, surrounding rippling pools of brackish
water.  Borne about upon the wind currents, the thick smell of decay
saturates the air.

branches, forming a wall of wood that seems to swallow the road into its
dark maw.

E
swamp marsh~
Spreading northward, the quagmire of mud and water is flanked by the
forested slops of the valley.  At the northern end, a great spire of rock
rises to over one hundred feet high, its shadow cast across the landscape. 
Small, plump birds meander between stands of flax and rushes, searching
for food in the dank ground.

About the size of a cat, the small birds appear to be flightless, using

Winding Road - Before a Stone Bridge~
A bubbling stream dances down between the grass and swamp reeds, heading
in a southerly direction.  Water weeds cover much of its surface, the
muddy waters rich with debris from the swamp that feeds it.  Dragonflies
and midges dance on the warm breeze, alighting on the water before darting
skyward.  The valley rises starkly, to the west, turning into low
forested hills further along in that direction.  In the distance to the
north, a spire of rock rises starkly, dominating the horizon; it appears
to be well over a hundred yards in height with forest growth along its
slopes and across the eastern valley side.  A dusty road winds across the
vale basin, flanked on one side by the marsh and on the other by
grasslands.  Spanning the muddy stream is a solid-looking stone bridge,
its surface speckled with moss and lichen.  Westward, the road heads up
the valley side and into the forest.

Splotches of chocolate-colored muddy water drift downstream, combining

Thick timbers support a stone bridge which spans the distance over a
muddy stream.  Gray stones, varying in shade from light to dark, are held
together with a thick slathing of mortar, splotches of it still damp from
recent repairs.  Clumps of moss and lichen cling to many of the stones,
blanketing the bridge in a sea of yellow and green.

Talidar's Spire - Town Well~
A @Cwell@n sits in the center of the clearing, surrounded by several
buildings.  Ivy and moss cover the sides of the @ewell@n, except on the
westward-lying side where a bronze @yplaque@n has been mounted.  The road to
the east leads up to a two-storied building, apparently dead-ending there. 
The tall structure to the south has been constructed from rough white
stone, braced with heavy timbers in order to increase its stability.  A
flimsy sign hangs below the doorway, swinging slightly in the wind.  To
the west, the trail heads towards a crossroads, disappearing in the
distance beneath the trees.

A framework of thick timbers braces a two-story building of off-white

Wide steps lead up to the front doors of a two-storied building to the

Path to Talidar's Spire~
Ferns and beech saplings grow in countless numbers beside the winding
forest road.  The saplings encircle ancient stumps of much older trees,
felled some time ago.  A few lupins add a dash of color to the
predominantly green woodlands, their sweet smelling flowers filling the
air with a pleasant scent.  Northward, the forest clears as the road
winds besides a two-story building, its details mostly obscured by timber
which remains standing just south of its walls.  To the south, the trail
begins to descend into dense, shadowy forest.

Young saplings, not quite three feet tall, encircle rotting stumps, their

~
E
winding forest road trail~
Slightly narrowing to the north, the dusty trail which wound its way
through the forest comes to an end, replaced by a hard-packed roadway,

and wagon tracks are pressed into the dirt, overlapping each other in
many places.
~

Once dominating the skyline of the forest, stumps are all that remain of

Inside the stone building, rich red and gold rugs cover the polished
floor.  The supporting beams have been carved into twisting vines, the
white wood gleaming as if freshly oiled.  Against the western wall, a
brass-banistered stairwell ascends to the second story, a woven carpet
covering the steps.  Southward, an iron-bound door has been set into the
stone wall, far more functional than the rest of the room.  A window in
the eastern wall has been similarly bound with steel bars, providing
safety to those who deposit their valuables with the guild.

Merchants' Guild - Auction House~
The floor has been polished until it gleams in the light cast by dangling
copper lanterns.  Tapestries hang from the white stone walls, depicting
busy market places and city streets.  Behind a wooden counter, a wide
lattice of shelving rests against the wall, filled with all manner of
goods waiting to be auctioned on behalf of guild members.  A heavy
iron-bound door in the northern wall leads back into the bank.

Copper lanterns hang from the rafters, bathing the auction house in a dim

Stitched with the depictions of their clientele, fine tapestries hang on
the wall in a representation of marketplaces where the guild does
business.  The quality of the sewing is excellent, but it becomes quickly
evident the guild did not pay much for the embroidery, as frayed edges
belie cheap materials.

Hung across the eastern wall are a series of shelves, with a variety of
goods displayed across their surfaces.  Leftover from previous auctions,
the items vary in quality from priceless to complete junk.  Evidently
kept to pay for unpaid fees, no price tags have been affixed by the guild
members.

At least three inches thick, a wooden door bound with iron straps

A polished bronze and marble stairwell descends into the bank below, a
carpet of red and gold spread out before its top step.  Stained glass
windows in the northern wall send a rainbow hue of color splashing across
the floor.  A beautifully carved desk rests against the eastern wall,
with a dark-grained armchair poised beside it.  Besides the desk two
silver sconces hold cups of burning oil, the flickering flames dancing
across the desk's surface.  A sweet fragrance fills the air, from drying
herbs suspended from the rafters.  Set into the southern wall, a wooden
door boasts a handle of beaten copper.

Bushes and shrubs grow in great proliferation in the shadows of the
ancient beeches.  Ferns and bracken spread out beneath them, forming the
lowest level of the forest stratification.  A winding trail heads
westward into the dark woods, moss hanging from the low branches dripping
with water.  A rundown @Gshack@n barely remains standing to the east, a wide
hole in its tiled roof.  Despite its appearance, it seems to be occupied,
as a tendril of wood smoke escapes its broken clay chimney.

Inside an Old Shack~
Wooden planks have been nailed together in such a shoddy manner that it
is a miracle the building still stands.  An open fire burns at the rear
of the shack, some of its smoke drawn up a clay chimney rising through a
gaping hole in the roof, the rest hanging in the air in a thick haze. 
Six-inch nails have been driven through the wood at seemingly random
intervals, each one supporting the half-skinned carcass of an animal or a
fully tanned pelt.  A rotting barrel and pine crates serve as furniture
within this workspace, covered by bits of freshly stripped meat and fur.

Narrow Trail~
Tendrils of moss hang like the beard of a ancient dwarf from the branches
of the beech trees.  The sound of dripping water echos throughout the
woods, as droplets fall from the end of the moss and onto the ferns below.
Winding through the woodlands is a narrow overgrown path, little more
than a goat track.  To the east, the forest thins while northward, it
becomes dense and the trees shroud the trail in gloom.

Several beech trees have been recently felled, creating a wagon-sized
clearing.  Sawdust and broken branches have been piled beside a trench,
dug into the ground beside the stumps.  Slender saplings have been
planted, an attempt to ensure the woods will be able to recover from the
loss of the trees.  Southward, a towering spire of rock dominates the

spreads out like the great roots of a petrifed tree, tendrils of rocks

bare and exposed.  Fissures riddle its surface, and jaggard outcrops
surround it.  At the spire's apex other plants return, a few scattered,
wind-bent trees struggling upon it.  Tumbling down the southern side are
countless miniature waterfalls, a misty haze surounding them.

waterfalls~
Cascading down the spire's side, the tumbling water spews hazes of spray
into the air.  Below the forest canopy, they disappear from sight; the
sound of splashing water echos throughout the woodlands.
~
E
boulders~
Speckled with moss, most of the boulders have fallen from the spire's
flank, crashing through the forest until the vegetation snares them in
its tangled mass.  Much of the landscape here is dotted with the spire's
rubble, a clear indication of its unstable nature.

Narrow Trail~
Shards of rock and boulders litter the forest floor, ferns and trees
growing in and around them.  Dominating the landscape to the south is a
huge, towering spire of rock, hundreds of feet high, the scattered
boulders obviously fallen from its jagged face.  To the north, a steep
bank drops away, the fern and moss-covered sides increasing its potential
danger.

Rising hundreds of feet overhead is a massive spire of rock.  Its tip
reaches nearly to the clouds, its upper portion paled and washed out by
distance.

boulders forest floor ferns trees~
Tumbled down from the southern spire, the boulders have carved out
resting spots in the forest.  Some of the larger rocks are about the size
of a wagon, but most are little over three feet across.  Growing around
the rubble are the slender-trunked beech trees and a dense swath of ferns. 
A damp layer of dew coats the ground cover, the droplets gleaming in the
light.

Coated with a lush lay of ferns and moss, the bank has been formed by a

Narrow Trail~
Trees crowd close together, their roots spreading out across the trail. 
Under their tangled roots a mass of ferns grow, their fronds forming
umbrellas of foliage that sparkle with dew.  Southward, the path heads
towards a stone building, half buried in the forest's green.  Beyond the
building, a massive wall of rock rises, towering into the sky.  To the
east, the path disappears into the dark forest, hidden in the gloom.

roots trail~
The narrow trail, already an obstacle course, is made more precarious by
the growth of gnarled roots across its surface.  The trees responsible
for this grow just off from the trail, their upper branches vying with
each other for sunlight.  The lower branches hang overhead, reaching
across the trail towards the other side, creating a sort of ceiling.

stone building massive wall rock~
A building of moss-covered stone rises up to the south, seemingly a part
of the towering cliffs behind it.  While lichens and other growth hide
the surface of the building, the cliff face is exposed, showing clefts
and fissures alongside smoother areas, where once the fallen rocks sat.

Narrow Trail - Before a Stone Building~
To the south, a stone building sits, almost completely enveloped in a sea
of ivy and ferns.  Atop its thatched roof, a few beech saplings grow, and
tendrils of potato vine curl around a clay-made chimney.  Behind the
structure, a towering cliff face rises out of the forest, its jagged
surface covered with cracks and fissures.  Northward, an overgrown path
winds into the shadowy forest, while to the west, a similarly overgrown
path heads into more open woods.  Lettering has been carved into the
stone of the building, creating a @Gsign@n of sorts.

stone building~
This single story building of dark stone blends into its surroundings, as
if it were a part of the forest itself.  Moss, lichen and ivy cling to
its pitted surface, disguising it in a mask of foliage.  Visible between
slender trees, the straws of the thatch roof are beginning to show the
first signs of rot and decay.
~

The trail winds snakelike between the obstacles littering the forest
floor: pitted rocks, leafy ferns and a fallen tree.  The limbs of nearby

Narrow Trail - Light Woodlands~
The crumbling cliffs to the south constantly rumble with falling rocks,
with some of the larger ones landing dangerously close to the trail. 
Ferns and bracken spread across the forest floor, carpeting the area in
green.  The broken surfaces of several boulders rise like teeth through
the ferns, their shattered forms bare of any plant life.  An unfortunate
tree lies where it fell, a boulder embedded in its broken trunk, the
impact of the stone ripping the tree apart.  Winding around the debris
and twisted tree roots, the trail runs in an easterly to westerly
direction.

crumbling cliffs~
These crumbling cliffs of granite could well have been here since the
world began.  Pockmarked and streaked by the elements, worn away by
erosion over countless centuries, this rock is worse for the wear.  Small
showers of stone tumble sporadically from deep clefts, and fissures and
cracks network over the exposed faces.
~
E
boulder boulders~
Large, uneven, vaguely cubic slabs of rock have tumbled from the towering
cliffs to lie on the ground among the vegetation.  Eroded similarly to
the cliffs they were once a part of, they also appear to be stained by
passing fauna.
~
E

Winding serpent-like underfoot, this narrow trail is formed from firmly
trodden hard-packed dirt.  The occasional footprint marks the surface of
the trail, which otherwise presents a random, slightly sandy face.
~
E
trees pine ferns~
Trees rise up on all sides, their tops lost in leafy greenery.  One
unfortunate pine tree fell sometime in the past to lie by the trail, its
surface fragmented and torn by a fallen boulder.  Ferns surround the base
of the tree, obscuring the carpet of fallen and rotting leaves, their
verdant fronds swaying slightly.

Mine Entrance~
Its doorway almost completely obscured by ferns, this squat stone
building appears to have been abandoned.  Once used to obscure the
entrance to a mine shaft, it has fallen upon hard times.  Weeds grow
freely from the earth, and tendrils of ivy cling to the walls and ceiling. 
The tunnel into the earth has collapsed, blocked by tons of boulders and
debris.  A clay stove and chimney, clogged with dense ash, sits idle in
the corner, its flue jammed with dried leaves and rocks that have fallen
through its upper opening.  Tracks in the dirt, where an old iron chest
and wooden crates have been shifted, indicate that a new resident
inhabits its uninviting interior.
