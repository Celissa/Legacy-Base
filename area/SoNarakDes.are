Hidden Oasis~
Nestled between the canyon and a rise of tightly packed sand dunes lies a
sparkling pool of water.  Rocks surround the edges of the oasis,
sheltering it from the loose sand kicked up by the usual sand storms. 
Several short but thick palm trees grow beside the thirst quenching pool. 
A slab of stone lies on its side underneath their branches.

E
palm trees~
Scattered around the placid pool of water stand short palm trees with
large green leaves.  The bark of many of the trees has an overcovering of
thin, brown moss.  Most of the trees are evenly spaced about the oasis'
waters and stone straight.  Two of the palms, though, one to the left and
one to the right of a stone slab, grow at an angle to one another, until
their trunks cross and form an "X" mark.
~
E
slab~
The slab of stone beneath the two palm trees looks extremely ancient and
heavy.  Cut into the shape of an oblong trapezoid, the slab bears a
superficial resemblance to a grave marker.  But instead of some witty or
melancholic epitaph, a series of hieroglyphics has been etched into its
surface.
~
E
canyon~
The tall, rock walls of the desert canyon surround this oasis on all
sides but the east, where there is a slight cleft in the rocks.  The
cleft is all but completely covered by tall desert grasses and bushes.
~
E
desert grasses bushes~
Tall and thick, both desert grasses and brown bushes grow along the
eastern fringes of the canyon here.  A particularly large grouping of
scrub bushes gather along a cleft in the east part of the canyon wall.
~
E
sand dunes~
Titanic dunes of sand can be seen over the tops of some of the shorter,
interior canyon walls.  Taller than what some dwarves might fondly call a
mountain, a few of the dunes, especially a colossal one of black sand to
the south, command closer inspection.
~
E
X-mark mark~
There is definitely a mark formed by the two trees in the form of an X.
~
E
pool water oasis~
Like the cool waters of a stream, the oasis before you is crystal-clear. 
Strangely, though, this oasis is not as shallow as you have come to
expect from desert water sources.  In fact, you cannot see its bottom
though its waters are so clear.

Below the Surface of the Oasis~
Regardless of your light source, you find it difficult to see much in the
dark blue waters of the oasis.  You can, however, see the surface of the
oasis, which beckons upward to you strangely.  The sides of the oasis
basin appear to be of some type of grainy, porous rock which has little
clusters of bright algae clinging to it.  Below, descending further down
into the depths of the water-filled shaft, there is movement.

Gazing upwards through the dark blue waters of the oasis, you can see the
surface still.  With little effort, you could easily swim your way back
up to its comforting shore.
~
E

As you stare down into the depths of the oasis, you can see very little. 
A scattering of movement here, perhaps a few plants there.  Otherwise,
the depths of the oasis are a complete mystery.
~
E
movement~
From what little you can see through the dark, blue waters, the movement
looks to be coming from a variety of tendril-like plants swaying back and
forth in the depths.
~
E
walls sides porous~
The sides of the oasis basin are rough and porous, much like pumice. 
However, the pores are much smaller, though, and appear to be holding the
waters of the oasis in their grasp with little trouble.  Growing in the
crevices and many of the basis's pores are patches of bright, colorful
algae.
~
E
bright algae colorful~
Lacking roots or leaves, clusters of fuzzy algae cling to the sides of
the oasis basin.  The algae come in all shades and colors, from a deep
red to a bright blue.  For the most part, the algae just adds color to
the otherwise dark depths of the oasis.  However, there is evidence that
at least a few of the aquatic plants have been the source of food for
some creature.  Entire chunks are missing out of some of these pieces of
algae.

Within the Oasis~
Though the waters around you are becoming increasingly dark and hard to
see through, your eyes can barely discern the surface from here.  Around
you the circular oasis basin walls press and descend still further down
into the depths of the oasis.  More brightly colored patches of algae and
small, leafy plants cling to the basin walls.  Rising from below, you can
see the tops of tendril leaves, which spiral like an alicorn, swaying
back and forth gently almost hypnotically.

plants leafy small~
It is unusual to find plants growing so deep below the surface, away from
the sunlight, but nevertheless, there are several clinging to the sides
of the basin.  The chief and most colorful of the small, leafy plants is
a primrose creeper.  Its tendril branches stretch out in all directions
in the water, with a covering of red-veined and oval-shaped leaves.  A
smattering of vibrant yellow flowers also bloom along the tendrils.
~
E
bright colorful algae~
Patches of algae in every color imaginable grow in sparse patches along
the sides of the oasis.  In several places, the algae are missing large
portions of themselves; as if something has taken a very large chunk out
of them.
~
E
top alicorn tendril ~
The spiraling tendrils of long, aquatic grasses sway back and forth in
the depths of the oasis.  As you get closer to them, they seem to react
to your presence and begin to sway more violently.
~
E
basin walls~
The walls of the basin are formed from a pumice-like rock with smaller
pores and a little smoother surface.  The pores seem to be only
semi-permeable, for it looks as though no waters are escaping from the
oasis.

Deep Under the Oasis~
At last, it seems, you have reached the floor of the deep, oasis basin. 
The water here is clearer, allowing you to take in all the details of the
sandy-floored area.  Scattered along the oasis bottom are varies
outcroppings of rock and bits of shell which lie here and there near the
foot of several colossal spiraling plants.  The twisted tendril vines
sway from side to side and stretch upwards toward the surface of the
oasis.  Also, resting on the oasis bottom, are several larger-than-normal
fresh water oysters.

The bottom of the oasis basin is covered with countless fine grains of
tan sand.  A variety of plants erupt out of the sandy earth, as do
several rock outcroppings.
~
E
rocky outcroppings~
On closer inspection, the outcroppings of rock do not appear to have
originally been part of the underwater terrain here.  Instead, judging
from the variety of stone color (some black, some red, some white)
present, it appears that the rocks have been tossed into the oasis and
have settled to the bottom.  Clinging to the outcroppings are patches of
colorful algae.

Strewn about the sandy floor of the oasis are pieces of old and broken
shells.  Many of the shells look to be but smaller fragments of giant
oyster shells.

Gigantic aquatic plants whose roots look deeply dug into the sandy floor

Beneath a couple of the rock outcroppings are beds of giant, fresh water
oysters.  Many of the oysters are larger than a dwarf and twice as wide. 
Most of the oysters are of a iridescent white color, but a few have pink

Dusty, Scrub Covered Trail~
Scattered over the flat desert terrain, bantam bundles of brown grass and
small bushes strive to stay alive, their roots clawing into the sand
seeking precious moisture.  A ramshackle tent constructed from bits of
wood and canvas sits off to the east, half buried in a tall sand dune. 
The tent leans to one side against the outermost edge of a vast stone
structure whose presence dwarfs the entire region.  A well-trod trail
leads south through the desert, outlined vaguely by small rocks and
pebbles.

Hermit's Tent~
The interior of this piecemeal tent smells of rotten meat and improperly
cured hides.  A half-eaten carcass of a large, furry beast hangs from the
main tent pole, providing a feasting ground for flies.  In the center of
the tent, a ring of stones surrounds a burning campfire.  Stuffed pillows
and blankets lie scattered around the edges of the campfire.

E
campfire circular hearth~
The small campfire in the center of the tent lies within a pit, dug deep
into the sandy floor.  Twelve rocks encircle the campfire, which has been
allowed to burn low.  Only hot coals remain in the fire pit.
~
E
ring rocks twelve~
Out of the twelve stones encircling the campfire, no two appear to be the
same size or shape.  Though each rock looks to be of hard granite, veins
or chunks of minerals bulge out from their surfaces.  From a pale white
mineral to what looks like obsidian, the rings of stone contain an entire
spectrum of color.
~
E
pillows ~
Sewn together from animal hides and stuffed with whatever probably was at
hand, there are a variety of pillows resting about the campfire, just far
enough away from it to not pose a problem.  From a rotten duck feather
pillow to a soft and furry rabbit skin one, the pillows, at least, look
comfortable.  Who cares if they are not clean?  Behind one of the pillows
is a stack of old parchment.
~
E
blankets~
For the most part, the blankets are woven of course stuffs and have seen
better days.  Many are riddled with holes and tears along their edges. 
One blanket, though, looks remarkably well made.  It is made from a soft
fabric that has been dyed blue.  Around its edges there is a design done
in gold thread and glass beads.  The blanket looks much too royal to be in
a dump like this.
~
E
carcass furry beast~
Suspended from the main tent pole in the ceiling dangles the carcass of
some animal.  Judging from the chunks of flesh missing out of the beast,
it has served as a meal more than once.  Flies gather around the rotting
corpse as do maggots.
~
E
stack parchments~
Most of the pieces of parchment behind the pillow have been rendered
illegible.  Some have been ruined by water damage and others crumble at
the touch.  One piece of parchment, though, looks remarkably well
preserved.  It is made of pounded papyrus.
~
E
pounded papyrus page~
The page of pounded papyrus is covered with a series of hieroglyphics.

Tracks in the Sand~
The tracks of something large, probably a beast of burden, have been laid
in the soft desert sands.  Though the tracks are fairly fresh, the
unpredictable desert winds are liable to erase all trace of them within
the next few hours.  Leading south, the foreign tracks merge with a scrub
covered landscape.

Nothing but plain, level sand covers the land stretching out before you. 
No rocks, buildings, plants, or animal dens jut outward out of the sand
to disrupt the flatness of the barren wasteland.  The sole exception to

The beginnings of a sandstorm start to take shape as a series of wind
gusts gather up sand.  The sand, caught up in twirling masses of air,

much calmer.  What lies to the west, however, is another matter entirely,
for the sands in that direction look violent enough to rip the skin 
off your bones.

Caught between two canyon walls which rise up to the west and east, a
narrow swath of desert travels a north-south path through their middle. 
Swirling on whirlwinds of hot air, the tan sand clouds the air, stinging
your skin and making it very difficult to breathe.  There is some hope
though, for while the sandstorm rages to the north, it appears to be
slackening to the south.

The beginnings of a brutish sandstorm are taking shape here.  As the
wind picks up speed, increasing amounts of sand are carried with it,

worse.  To the east lies a reach of desert land, covered with dark

darker sand takes it place.  Black as night, the dark sands are a match
for the ebony canyons which rise up to merge with the brown canyon walls
which predominate to the north.

Barren Wasteland of Black Sand~
Where most of the rocky canyon is either grey or tan in color, here it is
a deep ebony.  Consequently, centuries of weathering have altered the tan
desert sands to a deep brown/black color.  The dry, barren desert of
black sand creeps onward to the east before opening out in almost all
directions.

Something strange must have occurred in this area once.  A great
earthquake...a volcanic eruption...something.  Because something must
have happened to collide the black, sandstone rock canyon into the
normally tan-colored rocks.  Whatever it portends, the sands below are as
dark as the canyon walls here.

Barren Wasteland of Black Sand~
The weathering of the black rock canyon here has covered the usual bleak
stretch of tan desert sand with a darker, more bleak black sand.  The

which dot the ebony wasteland.

Black Sands Desert~
Across a plain of black sand stretch the shadows of star-shaped dunes. 
The dunes, each at least thirty feet high, rise up at seemingly random
intervals all over the black wasteland.  To the west soars a tall black
canyon of black sandstone much too steep to climb.

Black Sand Dunes~
Black as night and hotter than the sun, the sands of the black desert
reach out in all directions, washing over chunks of fallen cliff rock and
large boulders.  To the west, the sands lap at the base of the black
canyon wall which stretches north to south.  Mounds of black sand in
spiraling star shapes dot the landscape in a pattern-like grace.

Bound neither by dunes or an erratic canyon of ebony rock, the undaunted

Barren Wasteland of Black Sand~
A series of star-shaped dunes rise up out of the otherwise flat black
desert expanse, making the desert seemingly mirror the night sky.  To the
south and east, the sandy wilderness continues onward, while the massive
black rock canyon blockades the north.  Eastward, a titanic sand dune,
taller than the tallest dragon, ascends into the sky like a stairway into

Although the black desert sands rise up to form graceful dunes whose
shapes are much like the glowing stars in the heavens, the arid land of
black sand is otherwise featureless.  Only brief glimpses of movement or
the sound of an animal's scream off in the distance provide evidence that
the black desert is not completely empty.  A colossal star-shaped dune,
larger by far than any others within this black wilderness, looms to the
north.

dunes star-shaped~
At least three times as wide and five times as high, a spiraling star
dune lies off to the north, its black sands glittering like the night sky. 
Barely a speck in the distance, you can make out what appears to be a
thick but short tree growing up out of the top of the titanic dune.

The tree which grows atop the dune to the north is thick around but very

Atop a Titanic Sand Dune~
An ancient tree, long since dead, sticks up out of this gigantic mound of
sand.  From atop the fantastically huge star dune, the entire southern
portion of the Narak desert can be seen.  From this vantage, it is
obvious that there is more to this desert than just sand and rocks. 
Moving rocks, hidden oases, carrion birds, desert foxes and all other
types of impressive formations and wild life can be seen from up here. 
Yet, the most impressive thing to behold is a stupendous stone edifice
with a triangular shape for each of its sides.

E
edifice pyramid stone~
An ancient stone ediface shaped like a pyramid looms mightily in the
distance.  Sheathed in limestone as pale as fresh spring grass, the
pyramid shines like a glowing beacon.  Deeply etched hieroglyphics only
partly visibly from any angle decorate the upper track of the pyramid tip.
~
E
ancient tree~
Old and gnarled, a thick but short tree stands upright out of the center
of the giant dune of black sand.  Most of its bark has been stripped away
and it has few branches left which have not been snapped in twain by the
high desert winds.  Judging from the size of its trunk, this tree could
be several hundreds years old.
~
E
branches~
Though only a handful of branches remain attached to the squat, dying
tree, the few still remaining have clusters of tiny, red and blue leaves. 
Along the underside of each branch grow short but thick spines.
~
E
trunk~
Most of the bark has been methodically stripped away from the base of the
tree, but whether by the wind or some toothy animal, it is hard to say. 
Also, a few roots lay exposed, which are also gnawed almost in two.  It
is no wonder this tree is dying.  Between the trunk's base and its roots,
there is a dark hollow.
~
E
hollow~
Cradled between two of the thicker roots lies a dark hollow, just big
enough for some medium sized animal to squeeze through.  There are no
signs of anything alive near the edge of the hollow and there is little
evidence thus far that anything truly dangerous would fit inside the hole.
~
E
leaves green blue~
Tiny clusters of blue and green leaves cling dearly to the last few
branches of the ancient and dying tree.  A majority of the leaves are
faded and wilted, as much as from the intense heat as probably the lack
of water.
~

Black Sand Dunes~
Here, in each of the cardinal directions, rises a star dune.  All four of
the dunes are about the same height and have approximately the same girth. 
Past a series of dunes to the east stands a colossal stone structure in
the shape of a pyramid.

star dunes~
Oddly enough, the four star-shaped dunes here lie each in a cardinal
direction.  The four dunes appear equally spaced apart and are all about
the same size and height.  A thick patch of brown desert scrub rises up
out of the middle of the dunes.
~
E
middle desert scrub patch~
Within the exact center of the cardinal dunes grows a tall patch of
desert grass.  About waist high, the thick, dead-brown-colored grass
waves to and fro with the gentle desert breeze traversing through the
area.  At the southern edge of the brown patch, something long and white
protrudes from the center of the grasses.
~
E
bone long white~
As you get closer to the patch of brown grass, you can tell that the
long, white object is just one of many bones which belong to a
dismembered corpse.  A few of the bones have been picked clean of meat,
but the majority of the corpse has been left to mummify in the hot desert
air.  About the size of a human, the remains, hidden within the patch of
brown grass, have yet to be fully picked over by scavengers.
~
E
corpse skeleton~
Though its flesh remains for the most part intact, having been mummified
by the dry desert air, the corpse in the grass has been completely
dismembered.  Its head lies tucked under an arm, its legs have been
removed from its body, and its hands are no longer present.  Something
savage and with a taste for killing must have wandered upon this hapless
adventurer.  The tattered remnants of armor and clothing still enclose
some portions of the corpse.
~
E
armor clothing  ~
The clothing and armor still wrapped around the mummified corpse appear
to have once been of higher quality than any normal man or woman might
have worn.  Bits of silver thread and lace hint that the person at one
time had a higher standard of living.  One thing the clothing and the
armor have in common, though, besides being extremely faded, is that
there is a small embroidered emblem of a single star located on each of
them.

Arid Black Desert~
Across the barren wasteland lay the black sands of the desert like a
blanket of darkness.  Occasionally, a fragment of rock, usually a yardang
or an almost perfectly round boulder, emerges out of the night sands.  To
the north lay four star dunes laid out in the cardinal directions while a
massive stone pyramid looms nearly overhead to the east.

the dunes is that they seem to each be representing one of the cardinal

pyramid stone~
From base to tip, the stone structure before you boggles the mind.  Who
and what constructed the pale, yellow-green limestone edifice is beyond
your knowledge.  You do know, however, that the techniques involved in
building the mammoth megalith have been used nowhere else.
~
E

As you examine the boulder, it looks like a normal, perfectly round rock. 
However, behind it, there is a trail, as though the rock has been moving. 
Yet clearly, the rock is as motionless as a mountain.
~
E
yardang~
A couple of yardangs rise up from the sandy black sea, offering perches
for whatever wishes to light on its surface.  Wide and flat, the yardangs
here balance on columns of black rock as black as the desert you are in.

Arid Black Desert~
The hot black sands of the desert come to rest here along the western
base of a great stone pyramid.  Judging from the size of the corner stone
here, the pyramid itself might be the largest structure in the entire
world!  Sheathed in polished limestone, the pyramid gleams and stretches
like a lighthouse beacon, lighting the way for wayward ships during a
violent storm.

Larger by far than any building you have seen in your entire life, the
stone pyramid before you might even dwarf some of the smaller mountains

power to be able to build something of this magnitude.  Encircling the
tip of the pyramid are hieroglyphic tracks.
~
E
base~
Along the base of the pyramid, there are obvious signs of both age and
vandalism.  Bits and pieces of the limestone sheathing have been removed
from the pyramids surface to reveal the quarry stone beneath.  In other
places, deep cracks run through the foundation of the pyramid.

E
limestone surface~
Sheets of pale yellow limestone fit together seamlessly upon the outer
surface of the colossal stone pyramid.  Smoothed and polished by the
abrasive desert environment, the surface of the pyramid gleams in the
center of the Naraki Desert like a lighthouse beacon.
~
E
pyramid~
Taller than the imagination, the giant stone structure before you rises
up into the sky.  Surrounded on all sides by the Naraki Desert, the
pyramid stands out like a lonely child forever sheltered by parents which
are the sands held tight within the ancient sunken upper portion of the
pyramid.  Towards the tip, it is etched with hieroglyphics that are just
too high up to examine.
~
E
star dunes~
Formed out of the black sand, swirled mounds of silt rest in massive,
scattered heaps throughout the barren plain.  Most of the star-shaped
dunes are of the same approximate size and shape, but a few of them are
oddly-lopsided.
~
E
base~
The base of the pyramid, in places, shows signs of wear and age.  Cracks
run through some of the limestone sheathing and where the limestone is
completely missing, the quarry stone beneath is chipped and broken.  On
one section of the pyramid's base, it looks as if someone has taken a
chisel to its foundation, in an effort, perhaps, at treasure hunting.

Black Sands Desert~
At last, there is an end to the monotonous black sands as they surge
upwards to the east to lay against the side of a massive stone structure. 
The pyramid, for that is what the structure is, stands thousands of feet
tall and has a limestone surface which gleams like polished diamond.  The
pyramid's base covers an insane amount of territory, though the star
dunes block the northern way around it.

E
base~
Much of the pyramid's base is completely covered with the ebony sand.  In
some places, the sand rises ten to twenty feet above what you might
normally consider ground level to obscure portions of its foundation.  In
a couple of places, though, some of the limestone has fallen (or been
broken) away, exposing thick quarry stone blocks of a pale orange-yellow
color.
~
E
star-shaped dunes  ~
Like a child's pinwheel, three long, curving arms of sand spiral around
to form a scattering of dunes shaped like stars.  Most of the dunes bear
a remarkable resemblance to one another but here, one dune, which has a
large indentation in one of its arms, stands out against an otherwise
monotonous landscape.
~
E
indentation bird carrion remains~
Within the sandy indentation of the sand dunes lies the half-eaten
carcass of some type of carrion creature.  What remains is its head, part
of its body, a wing, and one of its legs.  It looks as though something
reached out and ripped the carrion creature right down the center.  A lot
of the bird's feathers are missing and its flesh has already begun to rot
severely.
~
E
pyramid~
As evidenced by its base, this giant pyramid is built of orange quarry
stone that was later covered with pale green limestone.  As the pyramid
tapers to a tip, rows of hieroglyphics begin encircling it.  The
hieroglyphic tracks are several spans tall and look to have been hand
carved.

Arid Black Desert~
Out of the ebony sands rise up three tall, oval-shaped yardangs.  Stacked
atop each shelf of rocks stand a smaller pile of rocks.  If not for their
small size, one might think they were rock cairns.  Though a massive dune
of sand looms to the east, taller still is the colossal stone pyramid
which peeks over it.

yardangs~
These unusual rock formations rise up from the sandy sea of black as
slender columns of rock.  As they get a few feet tall, they spread
outward, forming a wide, flat surface.  On top of each of the three
yardangs here, there are piles of rock, taken from the black sandstone
canyon.
~
E
piles rock cairns~
Atop each of the three yardangs stand small piles of rock.  So small are
the little cairns that it is unlikely that they either contain anything
or have real purpose.  It is more likely that they have been erected as
some type of marker by some desert nomad or another.

Arid Black Desert~
In all directions lay the hot, black sands of the desert.  The heat of
the desert is so intense here with neither rock nor dune to provide
shelter that it is even difficult to breathe.  At one point, the terrain
suddenly creeps downward into a slope but then ascends just as quickly. 
Southward, yet more dunes rise up across the sandy plain.

The crevice formed by the two collapsed yardangs is cool and the sides of

Black Sand Dunes~
Bordered by the ebony rock of a towering canyon to the west, the black
sands of this portion of the Naraki Desert flow outward, away
from their prison wall.  Bits of debris lay scattered about, sticking up
out of the grainy desert silt.  The vague outline of a pyramid stands out
against the sky far to the northeast and is barely visible among the

The rocks covering the bones are much too heavy to lift comfortably and

Across the black desert plain lie dunes of sand shaped like spiraling

dunes star-shaped~
Unrelenting in their being, yet more star-shaped dunes rise and fall
within this portion of the desert.  Each dune has three arms, which curve
around like a windmill to form a star-lie pattern.  The crest of each
dune is level and smooth, as though a giant had come along a lopped off
the top of each and every single one.

Each of the honey-smelling blossoms has five petals attached to a thick

Strewn liberally across the desert plain stand immense piles of sand

Black Sand Dunes~
A series of eight star dunes stand to the north, edge to edge with one
another.  Just south of the eight dunes though stands a rather oddly
formed dune which is quite lopsided, as though something extremely large
just took a bite out of it!  To the south, the black desert becomes more
even and has fewer dunes.

lopsided dune        ~
Though the dune looks quite ordinary from nearly every direction, it's
not until you approach from the north that the dunes looks particularly
unusual.  Where once it had three gentle, curving arms which formed its
star-like shape, the northern arm has lost all shape, as though something
incredibly large had plowed right into it.

Black Sand Dunes~
While there is only one of the star-shaped dunes which are found so
commonly in this portion of the southern Narak desert, it is, however,
very massive.  In fact, it nearly rivals the great dune which lies
several measures to the northwest.  A stark-white object lying atop the
great dune stands out in great contrast with the ebony sands.

stark-white object~
As you approach the bleached-white object, it becomes quite obvious what
it is.  Indeed, the object is nothing other than the skeletal claw of a
lizardman long since deceased.  The finger bones are clutched tightly
together, as though they once held a death-grip around something.
~
E
skeletal claw~
The skeletal claw is still attached to a skeletal arm, but you seriously
doubt it would be worth the effort to pull the corpse out of the sand. 
Oddly enough, there are no gnaw marks on the exposed bones of the corpse. 
Rather, there is heavy pitting in the bone, giving it a spongy
appearance, as though the bone had been soaking in something corrosive.

Black Sand Dunes~
Between two larger star dunes to the east, there is a well trodden path. 
The further east the desert goes, the entirely black sand begins to shift
in composition.  At first there is only a slight intermingling of lighter
colored sand amidst the ebony grains, but soon, at the edge of the
eastern dunes, the sands once again are completely tan in color.  The
recent passing of several four-legged creatures as well as a drawn cart
is marked by a series of tracks.  A lot of the lesser vegetation along
the edge of the path has been trampled.

tracks~
The tracks leading east look a lot like horse tracks except for a couple
of reasons.  The first is that each imprint is much larger than that of a
horse's, roughly twice as big.  And secondly, unlike a horse's hoof,
these creatures have multiple clawed toes which are evident in their foot
prints.  Regardless of the differences, the tracks lead east toward the
southern side of the great pyramid and give evidence that the desert is
not as devoid of life as you were wont to believe.
~
E
vegetation~
Along the edges of the two dunes to the east, a few bunches of brown
desert grass and a couple of scrawny little bushes had, for some amount
of time, managed to exist in the harsh desert climate.  Now, though, the
efforts of these little plants have come to nothing for they have been
trampled by large beasts of burden traveling to the east.

Arid Black Desert~
Reaching high into the sky, a single leafless tree with a trunk easily
five yards across grows here, undaunted by the desert climate.  Around
the base of the tree's trunk lies a small mound of debris, perhaps
brought in by the erratic desert winds.  To the north there are faint
traces of a path while to the south lie the ruins of some stone structure.

stone structure ruins~
The ruins to the south look very much like the colossal stone pyramid to
the north east, but for two exceptions.  First, unlike the great pyramid,
the pyramid to the south is not covered in smooth, polished limestone, at
least not anymore.  And secondly, the set of ruins to the south, though
pyramidal in shape, are hundreds of times smaller than the great pyramid.
~
E
tree cactus~
The single, succulent cactus growing here is taller than most of the
other cacti in the region, its needles are thicker and longer, and its
trunk looks almost dead.  Cut into the thick trunk, there is a small hole.
~
E
hole trunk~
The hole inside the trunk of the cactus appears to have been scraped out
bit by bit over a fair amount of time.  Judging from the wads of grass
inside, the hole serves as some type of nest.
~
E
nest~
The nest within the cactus' trunk has been made from woven bits of grass,
both of a variety found only in the desert and of a type found only
outside of the desert.  Broken bits of egg shell lie scattered about the
floor of the nest.

Arid Black Desert~
Brown and withered, a tall, leafless tree covered in spiny needles has
been toppled by the merciless hand of a sand storm.  Broken bits of the
tree lie scattered about in the sand while the majority of the once
living plant has been reclaimed by the shifting black desert sands. 
Strangely, because of the way the tree fell, the pitchfork-shaped
branches of the tree point south, to where there appears to be a set of
stone ruins.

Scattered along its falling path, cactus needles lie everywhere.  A

Bits and pieces of the dead cactus lie everywhere.  The majority of the

evidence of being chewed off and dragged after its fall.  Most of the

Though the desert here is extremely even, a change from the sweeping
star-shaped dunes, the most remarkable things are the trees growing up
out of the harsh desert sands here.  While the trees themselves have no
leaves, their green trunks and pitchfork-shaped branches bear a bevy of
little purple blossoms and sharp needles.

With a trunk as thick as its pronged branches, each of the unusual trees
stands tall and proud.  The trees have no visible bark and are all the
same uniform dull-green color.  Thin, spiny needles stick up off its
branches all over and a spray of tiny yellow blossoms cling to the tips
of each branch, which invariably point upwards.
~
E
branches~
The branches of each of the spiny trees are arranged as such to resemble
a stretched, deformed pitchfork.  Each branch sprouts horizontally from
the green trunk and then turns upwards at a sharp, square angle.

The tiny clusters of yellow blossoms which decorate the tip of each
branch are about as big and as bright as a bumble bee.

Arid Black Desert~
This is the western end of a narrow canyon which leads both north and
east.  Through a small, rocky pass to the north you can see tall,
leafless trees which have somehow adapted to the dry climate.  To the
east, the canyon branches off even as it widens.

leafless tall trees~
The tall, leafless trees are actually very different from trees one might
normally find in a forest.  These particular trees have no leaves and
their bark is as green as a peridot.  Not only that, but they are shaped
like giant pitchforks.

Arid Black Desert~
A glossy, ebony sand covers the ground beneath your feet.  Even so, it is
obvious from its hardness that there is rock just under the surface of
the blanket of sand.  To the north, tall trees covered with spiny needles
and completely devoid of leaves stand out against the otherwise barren
landscape while in all other directions the rocky canyon branches off.

The trees which grow to the north are like none you have ever seen in a

giving the trees a pitchfork shape.  In place of leaves, each tree has a
host of spiny needles covering the length of their branches and trunk.

Rocky Canyon~
Twisting like a desert side winder, the tall rock walls of the canyon
curve around from the south to the north, forming a cul-de-sac.  The
dun-colored sands of the barren wasteland lie in undulating mounds
against the base of the canyon cliffs.  Several rocks, having broken away
from the canyon, lie scattered about the sandy ground.  At the center of
the cul-de-sac rises a lone dune of sand.

E
cliff~
These cliffs represent the southern most boundaries of the twisting
canyons which surround the desert.  Several of the cliffs jut inward,
towards the desert, at incredible sharp angles, making it impossible to
climb upwards.  One of the cliffs, though, is sloped just at the right
angle to climb.  The face of this particular cliff has several
indentations cut into it.
~
E
indentations~
The indentations running up and down the face of the cliff would make
excellent hand holds.  In fact, judging from the cut marks in the canyon
stone, someone must have intended them to be such.  The indentations seem
to run down below the sand itself.
~
E
rocks~
Along the base of one of the cliffs, chunks of rock lie in a scattered
circle of fallen debris.  Although some of the rocks appear to have
flaked off from the sandstone canyon on their own, most of the rocks have
sharp, jagged edges, which is reminiscent of being chiseled out of the
cliff face.  And indeed, there are several indentations in this
particular cliff that nature had no hand in making.
~
E
lone dune ~
The lone dune of sand is comprised of red, black, white and tan desert
silt.  There are patterns trailing up and over the sand dune and assorted
tracks running across it.  There is an unusual divot at the base
of the dune.

Edge of Canyon~
The twisting rock cliffs which form a barrier around the entire Naraki
desert rise up to the east and south.  Through a narrow pass to the north
lie ebony dunes of sand and tall, leafless trees completely green in
color.  A passage through the bowels of the canyon leads westward.  It
does not appear well-traveled.

Resting on its side, a thin, stone column sculpted from dull yellow
quarry stone threatens to disappear beneath the churning black sands of
the desert as time passes it by.  About two-feet thick in diameter, the
stone structure lies in several pieces, pieces of which stick up above
the silt.

Many of the pieces of the obelisk have deep cracks running through them,
making it hard to tell much about them.  From what you can see, though,
the obelisk, for that is what it once was, use to be covered with a
complex series of hieroglyphics.  Now, though, only a handful of them can
be made out clearly.

Sticking up out of the middle of the black desert sand rests a large

Here, the canyon slopes upward enough so that the ebony desert sands can
only lap at the canyon rock below your feet.  It seems that you are
standing before the southernmost boundary of the twisted canyon which
surrounds the Naraki desert.  As in most cases, the cliffs here slope
inward, making any thoughts as to climbing them irrelevant.  To the east
and west, the rocky canyon continues onward, devoid of the black silt of
the desert to the north.

Like the sea of dark water the black sands so closely resemble, the
desert silt begins losing its grasp on the terrain here.  The tall,
star-shaped dunes give way to the upward rising floor of the canyon.  In
places, there is nothing but the natural rock of the canyon beneath your
feet.  Tall cliffs, marking the southern edge of the ancient sunken
valley, loom nearly overhead to the south and west.  Eastward lies a
stretch of canyon which is also free from the hot, ebony sands.

An Arid Path~
To the west, there is a remarkable change in the desert terrain.  Not
only are the sands and dunes there composed of sands entirely black in
color, but the rocky canyon as well is made up of an ebony sandstone. 
Here the sands and dunes are of a rich, tan color.  Just to the north
looms the immense great pyramid.  A crude trail, roughly outlined by
miscellaneous bits of rock and stone, leads east to west through the
desert here.  And while steep barchan dunes lie to the north and south,
there is barely room enough between the northern ones to pass.

The rough trail through the desert looks to be very old.  Some of the

Against an Extremely Large Pyramid~
Along the southern side of the gigantic pyramid, the hot desert sands
churn about like the waves of a restless sea.  There are long, deep gouges
dug into the stone where someone has removed the limestone sheathing and
carried off sizable chunks of quarry stone from the face of the
structure, perhaps looking for an entrance.  Up towards the top of the
pyramid, near the tip, you can make out part of a hieroglyphic track.

Encircling the tip of the pyramid are several horizontal rows or tracks
of hieroglyphics.  Though their meaning is meaningless, they look
particularly meaningful.
~
E
gouges~
Not even the harshest desert storm could cut into the side of the pyramid
the way it stands now.  And the obvious chisel marks clearly indicate
that someone proficient in stone craft has at least, on one occasion,
tried to find an entrance into the grand structure.
~
E
debris chips~
Having broken away during all the chiseling, hundreds of tiny flakes and
chips of stone lie around the base of the pyramid, where the limestone
sheathing has been totally removed.  Most of the quarry stone flakes lie
scattered singularly, but some have collected in piles just under where the
chiseler was trying his best to do whatever it is he hoped to accomplish.

shocking that the hieroglyphs, which were applied with some type of dark

An Arid Path~
Blocked by immense dunes of sand to the north and south, the only course
through this portion of the desert lies in following a crude path which
runs east to west.  The path looks well traveled, as there are numerous
footprints along it.  The edges of the path are marked by chunks of rock
and stone which have undoubtedly been placed here and there to guide
desert travelers and merchants.

Near an Impressive Pyramid~
The tan sands of the desert rise up to form impressive, crescent-shaped
dunes of sand to the north and south.  While generally too steep to climb
and too wide to pass between, as is the case to the south, the dunes to
the north are spaced fairly wide apart.  And from between the northern
dunes, you have a clear view of a colossal stone structure which is
incomparable to anything you could have possibly imagined.  A path
littered with foot prints leads from east to west through the desert,
past a pair of dunes to the east.

The stone structure which looms like a mountain before you is pyramidal

Looming overhead stands a vast stone pyramid fully a thousand horse spans
tall.  Its surface gleams with polished limestone and has been decorated
with scores of hieroglyphics along its upper track.  At the pyramid's
base, though, significant chunks of stone have been dug out of the
pyramid.

base~
The base of the pyramid speaks of a less glorious future for the colossal
structure.  All along its base, vast sections of the limestone sheathing
covering the quarry stone beneath has been removed, exposing bare stone. 
And in many places, the quarry stone blocks have large cracks running
through them.  The cracks, though, do not appear to represent any
instability in the pyramid itself.  Rather, they seem to indicate botched
attempts of people trying to dig a hole into the stones.  A large amount
of debris has accumulated around the base of the pyramid in these places,
where the quarry stone blocks are in the worst condition.
~
E
upper track~
The upper track of the pyramid consists of a row of hieroglyphics which
run all the way around the top of the pyramid, just below its tip.  The
limestone sheathing of the track is of a slightly different color to add
emphasis to the gigantic hieroglyphics.
~
E
debris     ~
For the most part, the debris collected around the base of the pyramid
contains flakes of broken quarry stone.  Here and there, a piece of
desert foliage long since dead sticks up out of one of the piles.

A tunnel about twelve man-lengths long has been cut into the side of the

Near an Impressive Pyramid~
As the desert path edged by rock and stone continues its east to west
course throughout the arid desert land, it shows no obvious signs of
ending.  To the north, the massive structure which is the pyramid cannot
be ignored while to the south, twin pillars of stone reach out to
the empty sky.

E
trail path~
As you examine the desert path, you notice that a greater number of the
stones which mark its boundaries look to be older and deeper buried.  You
can also see that a vast majority of these older rocks each bear a single
rune or character.
~
E
rune character~
As you look at a couple of what you suspect to be either runes 
or ancient characters, you notice that the markings are actually 
hieroglyphics. So, a single hieroglyphic has been either painted on, 
or in some cases carved, the border rocks. But why?
~
E
pillars stone twin~
The two pillars of stone that rise to the south are identical in every
way.  Though it could be just your imagination, but you see a faint
shimmering between the two columns.  It could be just a mirage.
~
E
pyramid~
Most of the entire pyramid is covered in green limestone so pale that it
appears almost white.  At its base, you can see orange quarry stone
peeking through where the limestone no longer is.  Though you cannot
discern them in much detail from here, rows of hieroglyphics encircle the
tip of the pyramid in four tracks.

Twin Columns~
Gradually, the tan sands and barchan dunes of the Naraki Desert merge and
give way to bright, crimson sands which seeps to the east like spilt
blood.  And in place of barchan dunes, the red desert has columnar dunes
of sand with spiral designs creeping up and branching off its core.  Two
columns of stone, sticking up out of the desert sands, one from a
crescent-shaped sand in the tan desert and the other in a spiraling dune
of the red desert.  Beside and between the two columns, yet more sandy
dunes rise up, walling off the terrain which might lie to the south.  Far
beyond the dunes, you can see the tops of the canyon walls.

two columns~
Carved from extremely large pieces of marble, these two columns are
identical in every respect.  Both stand up straight out of the dunes they
are mired in, as though they have simply been partly buried.  The surface
of both columns has been inset and inscribed with a variety of things,
including a series of hieroglyphics and valuable gems.
~
E
barchan crescent-shaped~
The barchan dunes of sand sweep to the west, forming crescent-shaped
pillows of sandy earth all across the arid plains.  A column of marble
juts out of the middle of one of the barchan dunes, partially buried.
~
E
red desert dunes~
Where the tan desert ends, the red desert begins.  And this is marked by
a shift in dunes.  The tan sands of the Naraki desert have barchan
dunes which are wide but relatively flat.  But where the red desert
begins its reign over the region, the sands rise up in a spiraling column
with twisted spikes coming off of its core.  Out of the spiral dunes, a
column of marble sticks up out of the nearest one.
~
E
invisible field~
A near-invisible field stretches between the two marble columns.  Twinges
of barely- tangible energy cascade over the surface of the field, causing
whatever hair you have to stand on end.
~
E
gems~
The gems set into the twin columns are cut into tear-drop shapes and have
gleaming facets which reflect the light.  The gems are securely set into
the marble of the columns and nothing short of destroying the columns
themselves would remove the valuable jewels.

A Broken Column~
Hotter than a smith's forge, the searing desert sands seem bent on
sucking every drop of moisture from your body.  The occasional dune dots
the arid plane, adding yet more obstacles besides the extreme heat to
overcome.  A marble column, white in color, juts up out of one such dune
at an odd angle.  The edges of the column are jagged and cracked and bits
of marble lie near it, in the sand.  Far to the north looms the giant
stone pyramid while to the east you can see the remains of a flat stone
foundation.

marble column~
As wide as your arm is long, this column of marble leans to one side,
embedded in a dune of sand.  The surface of the white, marble column is
covered with faint pictures and hieroglyphics.  Unfortunately, exposure
to the harsh, desert climate has worn away the details of most of the
paintings.
~
E
edges cracked bits ~
The edges of the column are cracked and broken.  Fragments of the stony
pillar lie around it, strewn along the top of the dune it is buried in. 
Most of the marble bits are too small to discern anything about them, but
a few are covered with faint traces of pigment.
~
E
pyramid~
You stand almost directly south of a gigantic stone pyramid.  Most of its
surface is sheathed in pale green limestone that has become polished over
time.  Along the edges of the pyramid's base, the limestone has been
stripped away, revealing orange quarrystone beneath.

Desert Ruins~
Just north of the crude path stretching east and west stands a heap of
limestone and marble stones atop plain quarry stones.  It looks as if one
time the marble formed columns which supported a roof of sorts over the
quarry stone foundation.  The ruins have been in this state for a long
time, it appears.  Not only has brown desert grass begun growing among
the ruins, but judging from the holes at the base of some of the larger
stones, animals have been using the ruins as a lair for quite some time.

limestone~
Every shred of limestone piled atop the ruins in this area is jagged and
broken into little bits.  The surface of much of the limestone has a
melted look, as though it came into contact with something blazing hot.
~
E
marble~
The remnants of marble piled all throughout the ruins are either round in
shape like wheels, or it is obvious that at one time, before they were
broken, that they were indeed round.  And judging from their uniform
shape and size, it seems that the marble fragments were part of huge
columns set into the quarry stone foundation.  The outer surface of much
of the marble is scorched and black, as if something extremely hot came
into contact with it.
~
E
quarry stone foundation~
The heavy quarry stone blocks, resemble not so much a foundation as they
do cap stones, or perhaps a roof.  And from the uneven positioning of
what you can see of the so called foundation about the sand, its original
locale was not here.  It seems as though it were planted here haphazardly. 
And judging from the cracked and shattered pieces of limestone still
sheathing portions of the quarry stone, it would seem some great force
crashed into this structure at some time or another.

At the bases of some of the larger stones, there are depressions or holes

A Broken Statue~
Here, the crude, rock-outlined desert trail curves from the west to the
south, passing between two steep barchan dunes.  To the east stands an
even taller dune.  But this one is shaped simply like an overgrown
anthill.  At the foot of the hill, its base covered by sand, stands a
statue.  Beyond the statue, to the far east, the sky is shadowed by a red
haze.

sand dune anthill~
This gigantic mound of tan sand resembles an anthill in every 
way. All it needs is a troop of worker ants marching to and fro 
along its surface to play the part. Wider than the crescent-shaped 
barchan dunes, this dune manages to cut off access to the east.
~
E
statue~
This stone statue stands about three times your own height and rests upon
a pedestal which merges into the statue itself.  It has a muscular,
humanoid body, with bulging arms, legs, and pecs.  Its feet end in
vicious-looking claws and its hand(for only one remains) is poised as if
something once was held in its clawed grip.  Its other hand is no where
in sight.  The head of the statue is also absent.  Both hand and head
look to have been cleanly severed.

A Stone Foundation~
A depression has been made in the sand here and the remains of a
stonework foundation have been laid bare.  Around the foundation stand
mounds of sand.  Some of the mounds are natural dunes and some appear to
be merely piles, where the sand has been removed during the excavation of
the foundation.  Discarded by one of the piles of sand there are the
broken fragments of a few wooden shovels.

broken fragments shovels~
The cracked and shattered pieces of several spades lie atop the sand,
only partly buried.  The digging tools look to have been fairly recently,
as the wood shows no signs of warping or bleaching.  The blade of each
shovel is splintered and dented heavily, as though it has been used
harshly.
~
E
mounds ~
The mounds of sand standing in piles next to the stone foundation and
natural dunes are what use to fill in the depression of sand.  The mounds
look to have been recently shoveled, since the desert has yet to
redistribute the sand.
~
E
dunes~
Dunes of red sand stand all around the foundation of stone, almost in a
protective stance.  Spindles of sand wind around a singular column, which
spirals straight up.  Each dune stands over fifty feet tall.  To the
east, the dunes have a slight gap between them.

The foundation of stone which someone has taken great pain to uncover is
built from giant, square blocks of pale orange quarry stone.  Each block
has been fit into position with precision beyond what even a dwarf is
capable of.  From the gradation of the stones, though, it becomes
apparent that rather than being the foundation of some ancient structure
no longer in evidence, that it is actually the roof of some structure
which lies beneath.  One of the stone blocks in the roof is loose.

Atop Ancient Ruins~
Surrounded on every side by imposing, spiraling dunes, a series of stone
ruins lie in a crumpled mass at your feet.  In places, the stone ruins
are completely covered by crimson sand while in others, the remains of
the structure can clearly be seen, just as if someone has tried to
excavate a portion of it.  From what lies above the desert's sandy
surface, you can see a few broken columns carved from pale orange quarry
stone.  The corners of a few square-cut blocks of the same stone also
stick up out of the sand.

ruins~
It is impossible to gauge what the ruins used to be, there simply is not
enough of the structure left, at least on the surface, to make an
educated guess.  But judging from the columns and blocks, the ruins could
have formed the roof or a floor of some small building.  The size and
thickness of the quarry stone blocks is suggestive that they probably
could not have been functional foundation stones.

The columns of stone which stick up out of the swirling red sands are
about three feet in diameter and perfectly round.  Faint but legible
hieroglyphics adorn one of the columns.
~
E
corners blocks~
Cut with a precision which belies their apparent age, the blocks of stone
are massive, yet thin.  They are carved from pale orange quarry stone and
only the corners appear to be at all weathered, as though they have only
recently been exposed to the elements.  The edge of another cut block,
this one of red sandstone, juts out of the side of one of the spiraling
dunes to the east.
~
E
1 east edge sandstone~
The block of red sandstone wedged into the side of one of the eastern
dunes of red sand looks purposefully placed there.  The stone glistens
like no sandstone you have ever seen, as though it has been coated with
something.  A few fissures travel over the surface of the sandstone block.
~
E
fissures~
The fissures appear to run throughout the entire block of sandstone.  It
would not take much to bash or crush the block into oblivion.
~
E
spiraling dunes~
Stream-like arms spiral off of central columns of sand, forming swirling
mounds of arid earth all around the ruins here.  The dunes stand tall and
in every direction, surrounding the ruins.  There seems to be very little

Before a Squat Tower of Sand~
A short, square tower built from sheets of red sandstone stands at the
end of this section of the desert like a boulder in a cul-de-sac.  The
tower has but one level and its top is rimmed by battlements.  A pile of
bound reeds lie up against the front of the tower, their ends flapping in
the breeze.  Immense dunes of sand stand in every other direction. 
Something strange seems to be near the reeds.

A pile of reeds stacked side to side lean up against the front of the

dunes immense~
Large, behemoth dunes of stand loom to the south and east, blocking your

dunes, but it appears a stone block denies passage through it.

The battlements of the squat tower have spear-like points jutting up out
of their tops.  The alternating indentation of the battlements, though,
seem too narrow and stilted to be used for defense.
~
E
red sandstone walls~
The sandstone walls of the tower glisten with moisture.  However, as you
look closer, the moisture is actually a coating of hardened resin.  Which
also means the sandstone walls are actually just carefully molded sand
walls.

A stone block lies wedged in a passage through the side of a westerly

Flat Wasteland~
Devoid of tall rocks or dunes, the desert terrain here is relatively flat
and unimpressive.  A small trail, possibly a lizard's, leads from the
surface of a flat slab of stone even with the sand only to disappear a
few feet later.  Far to the east looms a gigantic stone structure shaped
like a pyramid.

The gigantic structure to the east is a pyramid; indeed, it is the

gleam that only limestone, after several centuries of weathering, can
have.
~

flat slab stone~
On closer examination, this slab of stone, while flat, is actually made
up of more than one piece of rock.  In fact, the slab is composed of six
carefully fitted blocks of pale yellow quarry stone.  The joints between
the stones are fine enough that you have to squint to make them out. 
Like the pyramid to the east, this structure, at least at one time, had
obvious purpose.

A small trail winds its way through portions of the desert here and cease
at the entrance to a small hole.  The only indication that the tracks
belong to a lizard is the fact that in between the claw imprints there is
a line, probably made from a dragging tail.
