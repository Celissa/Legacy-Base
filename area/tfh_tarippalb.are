Joxqoun Alley~
A slight upward slant in the floor of this chamber reaches its apex in
the northeastern corner, where a narrow tunnel has been hewn through the
inposing face of the rock.  Ancient bricks line the cavern floor, their
surfaces worn to a smooth patina by centuries of traveling feet.  Stacks
of granite boulders comprise a collapsed building standing to the
southern side of the large chamber, each massive chunk of stone chipped
and gouged as if someone had been trying desparately to reach whatever
lies inside.  A pair of ancient lanterns dangle from heavy chains
connected to mounting posts, though no light will ever again shine from
these broken and battered husks.  The pathway of brick continues to the
west, paralleling the destroyed structure to the south.

apex northeastern corner tunnel~
The tunnel's sides have been worn smooth by either the hands of skilled
laborers or by the centuries of wear this chamber has seen.  Gleamiing
seams of scarlet-hued minerals run through the cold grey stone like
rippling waves through a pool of water.  Under the sporadic light of the
few lanterns scattered through the passageway, the walls appear to
shimmer and move, almost as if writhing to the rhythm of a hidden
heartbeat.

E
well-worn bricks smooth cavern pathway floor 1 down~
Covering the ground between the tunnel and the building, a pathway of
sandy-colored bricks offers a smooth roadway to walk upon.  Packed
tightly side by side, near-invisible traces of mortar can be seen between
the blocks, holding them snugly together.
~
E
building granite boulders 1 south~
The pale flesh tones of the boulders forming the ruined building to the
south contrasts with the darker grey stone of the tunnel walls.  Deep
chips and gouges score the side of the structure, apparently where some
sort of axe or pick has been used to try to gain access to whatever lies
inside the collapsed structure.

Hanging by thick chains from the front facade of the building along the
southern wall, this pair of ancient lanterns has definitly seen better
days.  The glass globes have been shattered, leaving only jagged edges
behind as testimony to the fact that they once existed at all.  A series
of tubes run alongside the broken and battered shells, apparently used to
pump oil to the lamps without having to manually refuel them.

Joxqoun Alley~
Paralleling the cavern wall to the north, an uneven walkway of worn
bricks provides a somewhat smooth passage through the underground network
of tunnels.  A squat building with walls of heavy granite boulders stands
to the south, its outer layer chipped and scarred with repeated attempts
at defacing its surface with derogatory comments about the weak midgets
who created this city.  A short flight of steps leads up to a ragged hole
in the northern face of the dusky stone wall, though what lies beyond its
lip is unclear.  The alleyway between the rock building leads off to the
west where it continues along the building, or to the east where a narrow
tunnel out of this huge natural cavern is visible in the distance.

Unlike many of the other sections of brick walkway through this city,
some of the paving stones here have been torn up and left askew.  Though
not providing the easiest of passages, the ancient bricks have been worn
to a faint polish beneath their coating of dirt by centuries of
travelling feet.

squat building heavy granite boulders~
Squared-off boulders of granite lie stacked upon one another, creating a
thickly-walled building to the south.  No entrance is visible along its

Vile comments about dwarves and their brethren are scratched upon its
exterior, marring the otherwise plain surface.
~

Numerous slanders have been etched into the stones to the south,

humorous to obscene, they include references unrepeatable in most social
circles.

Joxqoun Alley~
The southern edge of the cavern slopes slightly downward, leaving the
brick path outlining the street rather lopsided.  Immediately to the
south is a large building made of huge boulders stacked one atop another,
obviously a very secure location.  The side of the building bears many
gouged etchings where slanders degrading elves, their mothers and all the
light-loving people have been carved flagrantly into the rock face. 
Tarnished brass lanterns are mounted along the top of the structure to
provide light to this subterranean alley, but the oil tubes that once fed
the lanterns have been sliced open and siphoned off; indeed, all the
valuable pieces of metal have been stripped from the vacant-eyed lamps. 
The brick path leads east and west, with only the immensity of this
natural chamber visible in either direction.

Joxqoun Alley~
Inclining to the north towards the cavern wall, this natural chamber
remains one of the largest rooms within the underground city.  Deep scars
in the rock walls where minerals were mined out centuries ago have been
chipped away at the edges to create effigies of various evil gods in
order to defile this once beautiful city of the dwarves.  A few small
stalactites still remaining hanging from the ceiling, but most have been
broken off by mischevious travelers playing at target practice from below. 
The cavern floor has been cleared away of all stalagmites and rock,
replaced by a pattern of old, worn bricks that lead off to the south and
east.  A dull grey squat building has been built along the southern wall
of the immense chamber, with no windows or any other markings visible on
its northern side.

Silvery streaks of metal flakes indicate the ragged pockets in the tunnel

A crude visage of Ragezer and Gzarth preying on helpless halflings has
been chipped out of the wall, their primal carvings barely recognizable. 
Mined out in honor of the evil gods, their images mock the
lighter-skinned races which once roamed these tunnels.
~

Stubby stalactites hang down from the high ceiling, their pointed tips
long since broken and jagged.  Undoubtedly, their delicate appearance
once graced this chamber with icicle-like beauty, now, however, their
marred visage is only a distraction within the underground city.
~

Whatever stalagmites once spiraled up from the ground to touch the lofty

A simple structure stands to the southeast, built of greyish granite

Joxqoun Alley~
One of the larger chambers found within the Tar'ippal settlement, this
natural underground cavern opens up to the northeast.  The vaulted
ceiling soars far overhead; a few chains dangle from it, supporting
softly flickering lanterns.  The cave's rocky floor has been cleared of
all stalagmites and rock outcroppings, replaced instead by a wide expanse
of worn and pitted brick.  Narrow, man-made tunnels have been mined from
the sides of the cavern, opening to a @Gjewelry shop@n to the west and a
tunnel leading further into the city heading north and south.  A squat,
yet functional building of heavy granite blocks stands to the east, where
an overhead sign indicates that it houses the local @Gconstabulary's
office@n and @Gjail@n cells.

either the paving was done a long time ago or the bricks were re-used
from somewhere else.

Sparkles of light scatter from the shop to the west, born of the
brilliantly gleaming gemstones which sit on display inside the town's
jewelry shop.  An extraordinary goblin stands inside; unlike the majority
of his race, he is clean, well-groomed nicely dressed.
~

Squared-off boulders of granite have been stacked upon one another to

Jewelry Shop~
The @Gjeweler@n who runs this shop must be very well connected indeed, as
the cave his shop is built in is one of the finest within the city. 
Squared-off slabs of pristine peach-colored quartz line the walls, with
nary a scratch to mar their polished surface.  A wide countertop made of
varnished teakwood spans the width of the store, and a short doorway that
doubles as more counterspace swings on hinges near the end.  A tall rack
of platinum rods has been built against the back wall, with shelves of
padded velvet displaying his fine wares in glittering splendor.  Unlike
the rag-tag group that has mangled the rest of the city, this goblin
stands erect, is sharply dressed and spends most of his time examining
his finest posessions through a jeweler's loupe.

Unlike the roughly finished caves that most shopkeepers within the town
occupy, this one has been made over in style.  Squared sections of
peach-colored quartz line the walls, the pale color accenting the
platinum racks at the back of the shop.  Nary a defect can be seen in the

The finely sanded and polished teakwood counter offers a natural yet

within.

Almost invisible except for its seam, a small doorway in the spacious

Dead-End Street - Tar'ippal~
A multitude of footprints are scattered about the dirt in this chamber,
their shapes indicating that most of them belong to the goblish denizens
of the town, though some belong to various other cavern dwelling
creatures or visitors.  Tarnished brass lanterns dangle from the ceiling
on partially rusted chains, providing illumination for the surrounding
area.  A scratched and faded old sign, its writing illegible, dangles

The dirt floor of this cavern has been tightly packed from decades of

Most of the old brass lanterns hanging in two rows from the ceiling seem

glass panes shattered by vandals.  Years without upkeep have eliminated
any metallic sheen the brass might once have had, leaving the lanterns
tarnished and unimpressive.  The lanterns are fueled by a series of
tubes, which appear to run oil to them without requiring the townspeople
to manually refill them.

A myriad of sparkles glitter from the walls in the dancing shadows cast
about the small chamber by the softly burning oil lanterns dangling from
the chamber's ceiling.  A small feeding tube, running east and west,
snakes its way parallel to the dusty and tarnished lanterns, bringing
with it the fuel necessary for illumination.  Sloping slightly downward,
this underground street continues to the west, while to the north a small
tunnel grants access to Joxqoun Alley.  A rusting portcullis, with a
@glever@n beside it, stands where a doorway should to the east, appearing
to be more useful in keeping people in then out.

A series of dimly burning lanterns dangle scant inches from the high
tunnel ceiling, each suspended by a short chain of steel.  A narrow
feeding tube of oil connects to each lamp, ensuring that they stay alight. 
Tiny sparkles of light glimmer from the curved walls, where miniscule
fragments of reflective ore lie exposed.  This smoothly carved tunnel
extends to the east and west, sloping slightly upwards as it travels to
the west.  A jagged, moldy piece of driftwood dangles above a natural
cavern to the south; crude knife marks upon its surface indicate that a

Butcher Shop~
Wide gaps cut out of the stone face store a wide variety of dried goods,
haphazardly stocked in no apparent order.  Rotten wooden barrels sit in
one corner of the shop, their bands heavily rusted and barely managing to
hold their contents inside.  Stripped racks of some unidentified animals
hang from large metal hooks imbedded in the rock ceiling, dripping blood
and gore on the floor.  A grubby counter covered in filth stands in the
center of the shop.  A sneering goblin stands behind the counter, barely
noticing anyone's presence until the glint of a coin appears.

Intersection of Tar'alan and Grank~
The tiny, tar-smeared footprints of younger goblins dash madly along the
streets, dotting the worn tiles that pave the pathway.  The vast majority
of these stains seem to run towards the south and east, with fewer grubby
footprints heading towards the western tunnels.  The street is liberally
splattered with patches of viscous tar, no doubt remnants left by
generations of goblin-kind scampering to play in the well-known tar pits
to the south.  The cavern is brightly lit, with steady illumination
provided by the burning lanterns suspended from the ceiling high above. 
This would seem to be rather an important crossroads in the city; unlike
most, this junction of thoroughfares is marked by an old @Gsign@n, somewhat
dilapidated, yet still legible.

Worn red tiles, covered with bits of themselves which have been chipped
away by time, cover this small causeway.  The marks of goblin feet,
imprinted in tar and dirt upon the tiles, trace the paths of countless
townspeople going about their daily tasks.  The walls bear deep,
uncovered scars where mineral deposits once were located.  All that
remains now are deep gashes from where pickaxes and other mining
implements broke the otherwise smooth surface of the dull grey cavern
sides.

Grank Street~
The rose colored cobbles of this street perfectly curve with the natural
cavern towards the north and west, though they show extreme wear and some
slight neglect, no cobble has totally disintegrated to leave a hole in
street.  Tar covers a small ledge on the southern edge of this large
chamber to such an extreme that it appears to nearly be a pool.  The real
pool however can be seen a few feet below the ledge, giving this corner
in the road a grand view of all the happenings within the tar pit.

Many layers of tar have bubbled out of the pit and hardened on the ledge. 
The stone of the ledge is almost entirely obscured by the thick black

their play time.

Grank Street~
Tiny four-toed footprints are easily evident on the rose colored cobbles
of this ancient path.  Created from the tar covering the goblin children,
the footprints show nearly impossibly long stride lengths for such small
footprints, obviously the children were at a dead run.  A three foot long
goblin sized skid mark complete with a splatter on the wall next to the
doorway to the north shows where one young-in failed to make the turn to
the west on the slippery stones.  A small sign to the north denotes that
the shop is a small @gpet store@n, no doubt another reason why this is a
favored area for the town's children.

The most prominent feature of the doorway to the north is a large skid
mark of encrusted tar which ends with a black splatter against the wall
just a foot next to the doorway.  Whichever child made the mark must have
continued on immediately afterwards, and the pet store proprietor clearly
doesn't care about the mess, since no effort at all has been made to
clean up the eyesore.

Grank Street~
Splatterings of tar in the forms of tiny four-toed footprints cover the
cobbled street, these footprints tell a story of youth; scampering and
hopping as the goblin children run towards and away from the bubbling tar
pits to the east and west.  Short walls, standing only a foot tall,
blocks the tar from spilling out onto the street and further staining the
rose colored cobblestones.  The cobbles have been smoothed down from
centuries of use and now provide a level yet slightly slippery surface
with which to walk upon.  This underground roadway continues to the both
the north and south, opposing curves in the roadway a short distance in
each of those directions.

tar pit 1 west 1 east~
The bubbling tar pits to the east and west are held in by a foot-high
brick retaining wall which prevents the black liquid from oozing out unto
the street.  Despite this wall, however, tar has been tracked all over
the smooth cobblestones of the street, and the whole roadway has a
slightly blackened look.  The stench coming from the pits is quite
noxious, filling your nostrils with the scent of sulfur and brine, and
only grows worse as you move closer to the pits.  It appears that the pit
to the west runs deeper than the one to the east, though from casual
inspection it's difficult to be certain.

Grank Street~
Having once looked majestic, the rose colored cobbles lining the street
are now not only smoothed away from centuries of use, but cracked and
chipped from neglect.  The road shows evidence of recent use: tiny
four-toed footprints created by the goblin children tracking sticky tar
across the cobbles from the pit to the east.  Ironically the tar allows
one to walk without threat of slipping, as every step is forced as the
tar leeches onto every passerby.  The road is partially protected from
the acrid pit to the east; a small foot high wall prevents the tar from
covering the rose cobbles in their entirety.

Suffering from many years of neglect, the cobbles on the road are in bad

The low wall to the east forms a barrier between the tar pit and the

acrid stench of the tar is overpowering here.  To the east, the top of
the tar can be seen bubbling in the large basin.

The years have not been kind to this cobbled pathway.  While once the

before have barely been visible between the bricks, wide cracks display
quickly decaying or decayed mortar which has lost its gluelike

Grank Tarpit~
Jet black tar oozes and bubbles in a large pool here.  The overwhelming
amount of tar bubbling up from the ground is testament to the immense
depth of this pit.  Noxious fumes rise from the mass of thick viscous
liquid, its pungent odor assaulting the senses.  A foot-high brick
retaining wall has been erected to contain the tar, its red stones
darkened by caked black liquid.  The heat emanating from this deep
bubbling mass of oily liquid warms the surrounding area to an almost
uncomfortable level, indicating that bathing in its murky depths would be
extremely foolhardy.

This tar pit is extremely deep, probably the deepest to be found within

made visible only by the occasional bubble of gas breaking at the surface
of the pit.  Watching the black liquid carefully, you can occasionally
see an ivory-colored bone breaking the pit's otherwise midnight-hued
surface.  Likely, one of the town's denizens decided to take a bath here,
despite the boiling hot tar.

Four thick lines of heavy rope hang down from the vertical shaft in which
this platform dangles.  Each rope is three inches across, and wrapped in
a protective sheath of intertwined wire strands along its length. 
Numerous portions of the wire wrapping have snapped, their pointy edges
jutting forth in minute lengths.  Where the wire has snapped, individual
strands of rope have frayed, but looks like it will still hold up the
platform with ease.
~
E
set wrought-iron gates east~
Supported on both sides of the eastern rock face by metal tracks bolted to
its surface, a set of intricate wrought-iron gates hang to prevent the
foolhardy from falling to their deaths when the lift is not present on
that level.  What once have been a dazzling array of metalworking has
been reduced to a jumble of intersected rods, as most of the individual
tips of metal have been broken off, more than likely used to forge new
weapons or armor by scavengers.
~
E
heavily rusted old machinery gaps~
A complex set of pistons and gears is partially visible sticking out from
gaps cut into the rock face in the eastern corners of the vertical shaft.
Apparently a mechanism for opening and closing the wrought-iron gates
that protect bumbling passersby from falling into the lifter shaft.  Most
of the machinery has thick layers of rust covering its surface, almost
completely through the metal in some portions.  Long scratches on some
gears indicate some attempt at maintenance has taken place since the
lifter was built, though from the looks of things it could all fall apart
at any moment.
~
E
cast-iron chains handles red blue~
Twin cast-iron chains trail down from the inky blackness above this
platform, apparently the controls for this lift.  Each thick chain has a
painted wooden handle attached to its bottom link in order to provide a
steady grip for operation.  One of the ragged wooden handles is red, its
paint heavily worn off and faded.  The other handle has been colored
blue, its chipped surface flaking off with every pull.
~
E
small plaque floor~
Bolted to the wooden platform with heavy iron bolts, this small steel
plaque has resisted all attempts by vandals to mar its face with
derogatory slogans.  Stamped into the metal surface appears to be a
flaunting tale of how the ancient dwarves built this underground lift,
though the only portion that is still completely legible is the primitive
directions on how the lift works.

Tar'alan Street~
Soft flickers of muted light stream from the dimly burning lanterns
hanging from the ceiling.  An intricate latticework of steel chains and
narrow feeding tubes for oil support each lamp, and unlike many
throughout this city, these remain untouched by the wanton destruction so
prevalent elsewhere.  A small chunk of crimson-hued marble, dangling
somewhat precariously from the archway leading west, glows eerily like
freshly spilled blood in the soft play of light and shadow.  No signs
herald the function of the building to the west, though an odd bubbling
sound echoes from the depths of the peach-colored building from time to
time.  This small street curves around to the west and north, where the
sound of hammer striking steel can be heard occasionally.

Tar'alan Bathhouse~
Though the archway to the east is broad enough to easily support a pair
of double doors, nothing more blocks the view of the world outside this
pleasantly warm room than a small chunk of quartz dangling from a single
hinge.  The small faceted fragment hints at the sheer beauty of the
long-gone portals when they were whole, its vibrant crimson hue a
brilliant contrast to the milky quartz of the building.  A small hole has
been carved into the northern wall, mimicking a window left open to the
world, allowing a view of the oft-used street.  A perfect square has been
hollowed out in the center of the floor, with three tall steps leading
down into a sullenly bubbling pit of gooey tar.  Though wisps of noxious
steam drift lazily upwards from the sticky liquid, it doesn't seem too
hot; in fact, the warmth is rather pleasant.  Tar oozes slowly from a
crack in the western wall of the chamber, languidly seeping into the
large bath.  Over the centuries, the tar has eaten away at the smooth
quartz wall, leaving it pockmarked with many crevices.

comfortable relaxation of their occupants.  Three gracefully carved steps
lead down into the pit of tar, a single rail bisecting them to provide a
little stability.

Vlarack Way~
Beads of moisture cling to the granite walls, cascading down in rivulets
of condensation to the rock floor.  The temperature within this cavern is
oppressively hot, emanating from the cave to the east.  A gleaming
broadsword is mounted on a glazed wooden plaque just above the chamber
entrance, indicating that an @Gapprentice weaponsmith@n has taken up
residence within.  Cooler tunnels lead off to the west and south, their
polished surfaces a distinct contrast to the raggedly-mined texture
prevalent elsewhere within the underground city.  A wide path of smooth
bricks lines the passage floor, the gritty compound that holds them
together heavily eroded or swept away altogether, leaving uneven gaps.

Apprentice Weaponsmith~
With no airflow to circulate through this cavern deep within the earth,
the very air remains blisteringly hot, almost enough to scorch the lungs
of any who remain long within this place.  A squat forge has been
constructed in one corner of the area, possibly a remnant left by the
original builders of this underground city.  Numerous weapon racks stand
against the walls, each varying in height according to the weapons they
display.  A colossal anvil rests wearily in the center of the armory, its
surface worn and pitted from innumberable repeated blows.

Vlarack Way~
A thick haze of rancid fumes lingers in the tunnel, a by-product of the
oozing tar pit that bubbles just behind the restraining wall to the north. 
Smooth bricks line the ground of this subterranean tunnel, though many
have been smashed to bits or pried away.  The pathway runs from east to
west, with a ninety degree turn to the north visible just to the west,
curving around the gooey, tar-filled chasm.  A few stray shafts of light
drift in from the western chamber, muted and flickering, but just enough
to wreath this passageway in a hazy greyness somewhere between light and
darkness.

Vlarack Way~
The light radiating from the bonfire far to the north begins to give way
to the embrace of the shadows creeping in along the edges of the tunnel. 
Ragged stalactites dangle down from the ceiling, the tips jagged and
broken.  A sprawling pathway of smooth bricks makes a ninety degree turn
to lead out of this chamber towards the east and north.  The heavy, fetid
odor of boiling tar hangs in the sullen air, evidence of a tar pit not
far away.  An old brass lantern is mounted on a stone column in the
southwest corner of the tunnel, bereft of most of its parts.  Just barely
enough pieces remain to be certain that the battered heap of brass bits
was, in fact, a lantern at one point.

stalactites ceiling ragged 1 up~
Along the length of the dull-grey ceiling, large blunted stalactites reach
down from the cavern roof. The ragged rock formations are rough in texture,
but their once-sharp tips have been broken off, leaving them blunted and
unintimidating.  By the flickering firelight, you catch the gleam of a
small vein of peach-colored quartz in the ceiling, nestled just in
between two more sizeable stalactites.

The remains of what was once a functional brass lantern are bolted to
a nearby stone column here.  While once it served to banish the looming

From the looks of it, this vein has been deemed by the locals not to be

Vlarack Tarpit~
Encircled by a foot-high wall of bricks, this festering pool of tar
causes the entire chamber to reek of its noxious gases.  Oozing up from a
crack in the rough-hewn rock floor, the sticky liquid warms the immediate
area with its intense heat.  Both the walls of the cavern and the brick
barrier are heavily splattered with tar, the patterns left by the
exloding bubbles of sullen goo surprisingly delicate and lacy.  Although
reputed by many to be a source of healing energy, this fresh pit is far
too hot for anyone to be immersed within its torrid embrace for long
enough to be beneficial.  Towards the northeastern border of the bubbling
pit, several oddly-shaped objects protrude just above the surface of the
sticky goo.

Vlarack Way~
A pathway of worn, pale grey bricks lines the ground in a simple pattern
running north and south.  The bricks are stained with small splashes of
tar, apparently originating from the bubbling pit just to the east.  The
walls of the chamber have been ground smooth, the various gouges and
ancient mining scars filled in with a thick plaster of dark mortar.  The
tarnished shell of a brass lantern is mounted on the western wall, its
oil tank shorn off and mantles stolen decades ago.  Despite the lack of
lantern-light, the area is well lit, owing to a blazing bonfire atop the
fountain just north of here, though towards the southern end of the
passageway, seething shadows lie in wait.

sprawling pathway smooth bricks 1 down~
Paving Vlarack Way as it continues through the city, the tan-colored
bricks of this pathway have been worn down from years of heavy use.  The
walkway has been designed so that each individual brick is tightly packed
together with its neighbors, leaving only the thinnest trace of mortar
visible in the seems in between.
~
E
bubbling pit tar pool 1 east~
Just to the east, a thick pit of gooey tar bubbles up from a crack in the
ground, collecting in a circular depression walled off by a sturdy arc of
brick.  The noxious fumes wafting from the bubbling ooze become ever
stronger towards the eastern side of the cavern.
~
E
mineral deposit walls gouge~
The smooth grey walls bear evidence of use in some ancient mining
operation, with heavy gouges and chunks of stone cut out in several
places.  Almost every cut has been painstakingly smoothed over with many
a coating of thick plaster, however, leaving the walls mostly smooth, if
somewhat patched in appearance.
~
E
light bonfire blazing 1 north~
A massive bonfire has been lit in a basin to the north, providing a
single source of flickering illumination for the entire street.  Dim
lighting abounds throughout the cavern in corners and crevices where the
flame's light waxes weaker, and shadows dance and flit about the room to
the dancing glow of the fire's reddish flame.
~
E
brass lantern mount oil tank mantel~
The brass square of an old lantern has been mounted to the western cave
wall by a strong bolt, and still remains mostly intact.  However, it has
no source of oil, and anything of any value has already been removed from
it.  It is unlikely this lantern could ever be lit again, even if all the
missing parts were replaced.

Intersection of Vlarack and Gzarth's~
A wide staircase carved from stone spirals down from the open chamber
above, lining the outside edge of this circular cavern.  Carefully hewn
tunnels open up to the west, south and east, leading off into the rest of
the underground city.  A smaller passageway leads northward, heading into
a small alcove tucked into the northern wall.  A worn path of plain
bricks just a shade lighter than the cavern floor encircles a wide
@Gfountain@n carved of peach-colored quartz.  A roaring bonfire blazes in
the topmost basin of the fountain, illuminating the subterranean system
as far as the eye can see.  A tall, illegible @Gsignpost@n stands just
off the path.

The wide stone stairs spiral gradually around the circular walls of this
chamber, rising towards another chamber high above.  A chisel-mark here
and there on the age-smoothed stone indicates that at one time, there
might have been some sort of carving or other attempt at decorating the
plain stone steps, but time and the progression of many dirty, roughened
feet has erased all but this faintest of clues.  A layer of grime and
sticky patches of tar hug the once-graceful stairway like a skin of
filth; obviously the inhabitants of this city don't hold cleanliness as a

Empty Cave~
This shallow cave, scarely more than an alcove, seems to be naturally
formed.  The otherwise bleak walls of dark granite are striated with
dusky bands of sullen violet, flowing through the cold rough stone like
veins of darkened blood.  A haze of flickering light emanating from the
south glints on tiny bits of faceted quartz imbedded deep within the
stone.  Towards the south, the mouth of the little cave broadens into a
busy thoroughfare; the bustling sounds of a city clearly audible.

Small crystals of quartz glimmer in the faded light, looking almost like

Gzarth's Way~
The walls of this subterranean tunnel are smooth to the touch, the old
pick and chisel scars reminescent of its use as a mining tunnel patched
over with a thick plaster of dark mortar.  Pale bricks of plain stone
define the street, worn slick by centuries of use.  Ancient brass
lanterns dangle from the ceiling on heavy, rusted chains, the panes of
glass that surrounded wicks long-since shattered.  The bonfire atop the
enormous fountain to the west lights the otherwise darkened tunnels, as
the lanterns appear to have been dead for many a decade.  Several
passageways open out to the east, leading in various directions.  A plain
wooden sign hangs tiredly along the southern wall; perhaps at one time,
it described the locations of what lies to the east, but whatever words
once adorned its surface have been completely removed by rough scratches
and gouges.

Tightly fitting bricks of pale stone pave this pathway, cobbling the

Twin rows of brass lanterns are mounted near the ceiling of the
subterranean tunnel, high above the chamber floor.  A thick coat of

many of them are missing oil tanks, wicks, or some other part vital to

Gzarth's Way~
The tunnel leading in from the west slowly tapers here to a diminutive
chamber.  Three yawning mouths open up in the other cardinal directions,
each entrance displaying some sort of habitation.  Each passageway has
been well rounded off, framed with lintels of peach-colored quartz, upon
which is carved a small sign, originally in the language of the dwarf,
purportedly telling what lies within.  The original wording of the signs
is all but lost beneath the scribblings and etchings in just about every
other language prevalent among the lands, however, each is still somewhat
legible.  The passageway to the north is billed as leading to a
@Ghidesmaker@n, while the southern room seems to be a @Ggeneral store@n. 
A somewhat fancier, more flowing script is etched on the sign pointing
eastwards, indicating the town @Gbank@n as having been constructed there.

Taxidermist~
The stench of rotting flesh assails the senses immediately upon entry to
this cave-like room.  Thick pelts, hides and furs from all sorts of
animals hang on the walls, drying in the stale, foul-smelling air.  A
wide barrel sits slightly off to one side of the room, filled to
overflowing with the discarded entrails of the hapless animals, the
stinking heap left to slowly decay in the fetid room.  A couple
half-skinned corpses lie on blood-drenched slabs of rock in the center of
the room, a wooden box full of bloody skinning implements sitting handily
near-by.  The only exit leads to the south, back onto the main

Bank of Tar'Ippal~
An arc of faceted peach-colored quartz, about one foot wide at its
broadest point, encircles the smooth-walled room.  Though either end of
the arc tapers off towards the ground on both sides of the doorway, it
rises to about three feet off the ground for the majority of its length. 
A thin band of silvery-white metal curves along the eastern wall,
encompassing a semi-circular opening protected by thicker bars of the
same material.  Just to the left of the archway stands a heavy gate of
steel, its beams twisted and scarred, apparently from being torn down at
some point in its history.  A smooth tunnel leading westwards to the main
street is the only exit from this chamber.  Well-worn bricks line the
floor, forming a pathway to the exit.

An opening has been carved out of the eastern wall, with a squared-off

Scavenger's Shop~
Save for their protective coating of dust and grime, the shelves of the
store look rather barren, as if the shop were almost completely sold out. 
A long wooden counter blocks access to most of the goods, though shallow
buckets store scores of torches within arm's reach.  A dusty selection of
unused brass lanterns hang from hooks imbedded in the rock ceiling, their
mantles never before lit.  Tanned skins filled with flammable oil rest on
one shelf alongside a selection of candles, hemp wicks trimmed evenly and
ready for use.  The little shop's only exit lies to the north, leading
from this well-lit cave back onto the main thoroughfare.

Gzarth's Way~
A steep slope in the tunnel floor leads downwards as it runs westward. 
The area is quite well-lit, owing to the blazing bonfire atop the
fountain just to the east.  Walls once ragged and pock-marked with the
scars of heavy mining operations have been polished around the edges, the
worst of the dents and crags filled in with a dark coat of mortar. 
Widely spaced stairsteps of rounded bricks line the ground, providing a
stable surface upon which to walk.  A row of brass lanterns dangle on
heavy chains from the ceiling, their wicks dark and glass panes long
since shattered out by vandals.

Stable terraces of smoothly cut stone held together with ancient dark
mortar cover the chamber's floor, lessening the effect of the steeply
sloping tunnel.  Brackets probably meant for handrails lie empty
alongside both walls, the bars they once supported plundered many ages
ago.  An intricate pattern of light and shadow dances across the floor
and walls of the cavern as light filters in from the blazing bonfire at
the top of the tunnel to the east.  Just a bit to the west, the tunnel
floor levels out again, ceasing its rough descent.

Chimeras born of shadow and light flit across the walls of the chamber,
formed by the waning firelight cast by the blazing bonfire far to the
east.  The tunnel drifts upwards from here through a series of broad,
shallow terraces formed of smoothly worn bricks.  Each of the aged stone
bricks is carefully fitted to its neighbors, with barely the faintest
line of mortar suggesting that each is, in fact separate.  The ground
here is more or less level, branching out to the north and south, the
lanterns gleaming from each of those directions adding to the dappled
play of darkness and illumination.

Unlike many of the other lanterns scattered about the cavern, these seem

Before a Temple~
A blackness beyond a mere lack of illumination hovers closely over this
place.  Indeed, the area is lit by a small lantern high atop an iron
post, its mantle partially hooded to shine solely on a gargantuan statue
carved within the northern wall.  The carved figure isn't carved with the
same smooth expertise as the area around this place.  Instead, however,
the crudely chisled features add to the feature's menacing appearance. 
The very stone of this chamber is far different from the natural greys of
the surrounding area; the walls here are coal-black, the dull surface of
the strange material seeming to absorb most traces of illumination.  The
illusion of all-encompassing blackness is heightened by a pair of
ebon-flamed torches mounted to either side of a massive entryway leading
to the west.  A faint haze of smoke and incense stains the still, heavy
air, evoking somehow a faint sense of terror.  A @Rcurtain@n blocks off an
opening to the east, a rampant black unicorn emblazoned upon its surface.

Unlike the strange black flames of the nearby torches, the little fire

targeted to fall upon an immense statue set into the northern wall,
dancing upon its angular planes in such a way that it almost seems the
statue itself moves.

through the shrouded chamber.

Gzarth's Temple~
Shadows writhe around this blackened room in a mind-numbing dance,
choreographed by the flickering lights of hundreds of candles scattered
throughout the room.  The tall maroon and ebony candles rest upon every
flat surface within this temple of the god of stealth.  Niches and small
shelves have been gouged into the coal-black walls seemingly for the very
purpose of supporting the myriad of candles; obviously, shadows reign in
this holy sanctuary.  An altar, bedecked in the dried blood of sacrifices
past, rests at the absolute center of the chamber, surrounded by a pair
of interlocking pentagrams.  The innermost star has a blazing brazier at
each of its five points, while the outer pentagram is defined by nothing
more than searing black flames, feeding solely upon the rock itself. 
These magical flames give off no heat, the cold fire sending wild sparks
dancing and crackling through the air.

Tar'ippal Library~
This narrow landing overlooks a dark, musty chamber, a myriad of tiny
candles forming constellations of little flames against the gloom.  From
the oiled wooden door, high steps descend north and south a few yards to
the main body of the room - immediately, however, the way is choked by a
maze of bookshelves and cupboards.  The candles rest in wax-choked brass
and copper fittings atop the shelves in no regimented pattern,
dangerously close to the sealed tomes and chained scrolls that are
crammed every-which-way into the racks and piled high in the narrow

Zharx Street~
Though well-lit, this chamber has rather a foreboding feel to it.  The
smoothed rock walls are covered with layers of heavy, dark curtains of
moss, each dangling down from the stones upon which they cling like
organic stalactites.  Steady iron posts support lanterns high in the air,
each casting a swath of illumination to brighten the surrounding
passageways.  A slight slope leads downward into a separate cavern to
the west, near which a sign has been inscribed labeling this as the
town's @GHouse of Magic@n.  The eastern passageway carries the
distinctive odor of a bubbling tar pit, while a sign above the southern
doorway describes an @Gherbalist@n's residence.

Zharx Tarpit~
A bubbling pit of viscous, midnight-black liquid fills this part of the
cavern, contained solely by a foot-high retaining wall at its western
edge.  Waves of heat rise off the steaming tar, warming the chamber to
nearly unbearable temperatures.  Bubbles of pungent gas rise sullenly
through the oily muck as it slowly boils, filling the surrounding area
with a sulfurous stench.  Every now and then, a particularly large bubble
surfaces, its eruption causing small waves to run the length of the pool
of sticky tar, not dissipating until they finally crash against the walls
of the cavern.  The cavern walls are splattered with traces of the tar,
though in one area, it looks almost as if a design had been deliberately
etched with the sticky black goo.

Herbalist's Residence~
A pleasant smell permeates this cave, a myriad of scents blending
together in sweet harmony.  Stored neatly on tall cedar bookshelves are
hundreds of containers, each one meticulously organized and labeled. 
Squat clay pots and sealed glass jars contain flowers, herbs, and other
miscellaneous reagents from all over the known world, in addition to a
few plants that seem completely unidentifiable.  A slim counterspace has
charts of various plant types draped along its front, and heavy volumes
of herbal information stored to one side.  A metal scale with twin bowls
and a fine set of counterweights stands in the middle of the counter in
order to weigh some reagents, while a dull white mortar and pestle set
sits ready to grind herbs into a usable powder.

tall cedar bookshelves containers~
The sweet aroma of cedar lingers near these tall, reddish-brown cases. 
Though originally intended to house books, the shelves are full of many
containers of herbal remedies, each bearing a legend of its contents in a
precise script.
~
E
squat clay pots sealed glass jars flowers herbs reagents plants~
Short and tall, oblong and square, slender and stout, a variety of
containers are stacked all over the shelves and counters, with a few even
residing on the floor.  Through the sides of some of the glass jars, many
types of flowers, leaves, roots, stems and seeds can be seen, some
powdered, some still whole.  All in all, this workshop would seem to have
a very complete herbal pharmacoepia.
~
E
slim counterspace charts plant types~
Several hefty volumes and charts of herbal lore are stacked along the
counter, leaving very little free room for much of anything else.  Many
of the pages in the volume carry small stains from various plant juices
or powders along their edges, though never marring the carefully scribed
herbal recipes and identifications.
~
E
dull white mortar pestle set~
Worn smooth and stained to a dull shade something close to white, the
mortar and pestle set have obviously seen much use through the years.  A
few flakes of different colored herbs still cling to the old pestle,
testimony to their continued usefulness.

Elevator coding room~
Pale, cracked cobblestones line the floor this section of the caverns. 
The center of the roadway that leads from the wrought-iron gate to the
south is worn with age and use, and the bricks are covered with
tar-encrusted footprints.  An eyesore against the grey stone wall that it
protrudes from, an ivory-handled lever has been attached to a metal plate
built into the cavern wall near the southern gate.

Run-down Auction House~
Probably one of the oldest places in this city, the room smells of mold
and mildew.  Probably having been someones old home, it appears to have
been boarded up for a short period of time, as there are still boards on
the windows.  Having been converted into an auction house, there are your

Elevator coding room~
A sturdy oaken platform fifteen feet square dangles perilously in
mid-air, suspended from above by thick, wire-wrapped ropes at each corner.
A set of wrought-iron gates hang on tracks mounted on the rock wall to
the east on both sides of an opening into an underground tunnel.  Heavily
rusted old machinery is visibly attached to the iron gates along their
outer edges, disappearing into tall gaps mined from the stone face.
Trailing down from the darkness high above are two cast-iron chains with
slim handles connected to the bottom links.  One of the handles has been
painted red, and one has been painted blue.  A small plaque has
been bolted off to one side of the wooden floor.

Arcane House of Magic~
The lingering scent of incense greets the senses of anyone entering this
spacious cave.  Several scarred and scorched figurines hang limply along
the northern wall, looking as if they had witnessed first-hand training
of many students of the arcane arts.  Centered in the room, a casting
circle has been laid out with gritty black powder, a plethora of runes
scribed carefully around its edge.  The back of the chamber seems to be
set up as living quarters of a sort, with a white silk hammock suspended
between two pillars rising beside the western wall.  The southern end of
the room serves as a combination shop and laboratory.

Three or four battered straw dummies languish along the northern wall,

half-burned, others shattered by intense cold and yet others partially
dissolved.

The edge of this five foot circle is precisely defined, with not a single

A heavy, luxurious hammock of pure white silk hangs invitingly between
the pair of dark pillars towards the back of the cavern.  Several fluffy
pillows lie scattered in and near the hammock, their bright colors
lending the place a lived-in look.  Twined 'round each pillar are
hair-thin strands of silken cord, each bearing a load of hollowed out
bones carved into various shapes.  The rattling of the bones creates an
eerie music all its own, soft and atonal.

Joxqoun Alley~
A sharp corner brings the tunnel to a ninety degree angle here, with a
small passageway leading south while an enormous cavern opens up towards
the west.  A string of ancient lanterns dangle from mounts on both walls,
though only those along the eastern side still cast their dancing
flickers of illumination.  A supply line for the lanterns leads along the
ceiling, far above the reach of those who would attempt to siphon off its
precious burden of oil.  Ragged scars and deep holes mar the sides of the
tunnels where valueable minerals have been mined or pried away, leaving
the place forlorn and hollow looking.  A worn path of dense bricks covers
the floor, the old mortar holding the paving-stones in place slowly
crumbling away to dust.  A gap in the eastern wall leads to a short, dark
tunnel.

Twin rows of old brass lanterns are mounted near the high ceiling of the
subterranean tunnel, far out of the reach of any would-be vandals.  A
heavy coat of tarnish and dust mars the surface of the once-fine lamps,
making them almost worthless.  Though the lamps along the western side of
the tunnel hang dark and useless, the opposite lanterns shine bright,
their tubes of oil still intact.

Joxqoun Alley~
Two, much-abused, lanterns sag tiredly against the brackets holding them
on either side of a tiny passageway leading south.  Along the eastern
wall runs a seris of tubes bearing the precious oil that keeps the
heavily tarnished, pock-marked lamp alight.  A wide band of peach-colored
quartz frames the doorway leading south to an area that seems perfectly
square; obviously this small chamber wasn't formed by nature alone.  The
once smooth, bright surface of the crystalline stone is now covered in
ragged scars where vandals have raised their weapons to the mineral with
liberal abandon.  Precisely three feet above the ground, an
@Givory-handled lever@n juts out from a slot centered within the arch,
framed by a dull, rusted plate of iron.  The alleyway continues to the
north, quickly fading into shadows undisturbed by the wan, flickering
light.

A pair of brass lanterns, somewhat tarnished, but still in good working
condition, are bolted into the wall along the sides of this narrow
alleyway.  The broken panes of the lanterns attest to vandalism, and the
western lamp has had its oil tube stolen.  The eastern lamp, however, has
been left with enough working parts for its flickering light to illumine
the passageway.  The work of vandals is still apparent, however, on the
working lamp as well.  The dents and pock-marks covering its
once-lustrous surface have not damaged the lantern badly enough to render
it inoperable, though the flame is smaller and lends less light than the
lanterns seen in the distance.

feeding tube oil wall 1 east~
The one remaining feeding tube pumps oil to the lantern on the eastern
wall.  The dents and scratches which mar the surface of the lantern also
extend to the tube, coupled with a great deal of tarnish covering the
tube's length.  Near the point of attachment to the lantern, vandals have
tried to pry it loose, the seal showing small cracks where it was almost
breached.  The device continues along the surface of the wall, and runs
up into the ceiling, where it connects to whatever network of pipes
supplies its oil.

scars grime dirt mineral wide band peach-colored quartz arc doorway~
An arc of finely-worked quartz rims the top of the southern doorway, its
pale tan coloring still relatively visible beneath a great deal of dirt
and grime.  Vandalism has taken its toll on the arch.  Scars and
scratches cover its surface, testament to vicious attacks from a variety
of weapons and mining implements.  Centered within the arch on a dense
iron plate is an ivory-handled lever which seems to be important to the
functioning of something beyond the doorway.
~
E
ivory-handled lever slot framed dense iron plate~
Protruding from a dense iron plate which has been mounted directly into
the quartz arch above the southern door is a thick wooden beam, with a

mid-air, suspended from above by thick, wire-wrapped ropes at each corner. 
A set of wrought-iron gates hang on tracks mounted on the rock wall to

sturdy oaken platform~
A square wooden platform fifteen feet long on each side, made of oak
planks that have been reinforced with bands of iron.  The platform sways
slightly as it dangles perilously in mid-air within a vertical shaft,
only held up by four thick ropes in each corner that have been wrapped
with intertwined strands of wire.
~
E
thick wire-wrapped ropes corners~
Four thick lines of heavy rope hang down from the vertical shaft in which
this platform dangles.  Each rope is three inches across, and wrapped in
a protective sheath of intertwined wire strands along its length. 
Numerous portions of the wire wrapping have snapped, their pointy edges
jutting forth in minute lengths.  Where the wire has snapped, individual
strands of rope have frayed, but looks like it will still hold up the
platform with ease.
~
E
set wrought-iron gates west~
Supported on both sides of the west rock face by metal tracks bolted to
its surface, a set of intricate wrought-iron gates hang to prevent the
foolhardy from falling to their deaths when the lift is not present on
that level.  What once have been a dazzling array of metalworking has
been reduced to a jumble of intersected rods, as most of the individual
tips of metal have been broken off, more than likely used to forge new
weapons or armor by scavengers.
~
E
heavily rusted old machinery gaps~
A complex set of pistons and gears is partially visible sticking out from
gaps cut into the rock face in the western corners of the vertical shaft.
Apparently a mechanism for opening and closing the wrought-iron gates
that protect bumbling passersby from falling into the lifter shaft.  Most
of the machinery has thick layers of rust covering its surface, almost
completely through the metal in some portions.  Long scratches on some
gears indicate some attempt at maintenance has taken place since the
lifter was built, though from the looks of things it could all fall apart
at any moment.
~
E
cast-iron chains handles red blue~
Twin cast-iron chains trail down from the inky blackness above this
platform, apparently the controls for this lift.  Each thick chain has a
painted wooden handle attached to its bottom link in order to provide a
steady grip for operation.  One of the ragged wooden handles is red, its
paint heavily worn off and faded.  The other handle has been colored
blue, its chipped surface flaking off with every pull.
~
E
small plaque floor~
Bolted to the wooden platform with heavy iron bolts, this small steel
plaque has resisted all attempts by vandals to mar its face with
derogatory slogans.  Stamped into the metal surface appears to be a
flaunting tale of how the ancient dwarves built this underground lift,
though the only portion that is still completely legible is the primitive
directions on how the lift works.

Tar'ippal Thoroughfare~
The natural walls of the cavern close in slightly reminding the passerby
that they are well below ground.  Though the walls appear to be wholly
un-worked the ground beneath foot is instead a bricked road -- with only
a few of these ancient building blocks missing.  Combined with the
lightly worn road, frequent scratch marks mar the surface of the walls,
the more heavily vandalized segments to the south.  Buildings are within
easy sight of here just a short distance to the west, while to the east
the thoroughfare deadends in a small set of gates, with a square chamber
beyond.  Next to the wrought-iron gates is an @Givory-handled lever@n
that juts out from a slot in the stone wall.

Tar'ippal Thoroughfare~
Ages have past since the bricks lining the ground were originally set
beneath the natural cavern ceiling.  Gaps abound on this thoroughfare
where the bricks have either been removed or crumbled with age, showing
more than a touch of neglect in the roads upkeep.  Quartz buildings line
this road on three sides, east alone left as the sole continuation of the
small road.  The buildings to the south and west both sport elegant
archways leading into the structures, while to the north the entrance is
a mere hole punched into the peach-colored wall.  Artistic carvings have
been etched over each of the ancient archways, while a crude mockery of
their beauty has been driven into the wall over the hole to the north.

Tar'ippal Armorshop~
This small squat building has certainly seen better days.  Soot and smoke
from years of candle burning and forge work now stain the peach colored
quartz used in the original construction.  An elaborate archway stands to
the east, once the sole egress point from this room; it now lies
hopelessly blocked by some ages past cave-in.  In a half-hearted attempt
to keep this room as a functioning part of the town, a small hole has
seen knocked out of the near-priceless wall to the south.  A single table
stands as both a workbench and counter for the shopkeeper, set just a few
feet in front of the makeshift forge.

Tar'ippal Weaponshop~
The cracked quartz walls of this squat building are covered with a
sickly, oil-like condensation.  Racks of weapons stand beside the forge,
with its continuously burning flame, which birthened them into this world. 
Twin anvils stand evident in the middle of the room, a large board thrown
over one to create a makeshift counter, leaving only a sole anvil to be
used in the forging process.  Two elegant archways were created in the
original construction of this structure, the north now hopelessly blocked
by an ancient cave-in, leaving the only available exit to the east.

Tar'ippal Specialty Shop~
This circular building was literally horseshoed into a natural formation
in the rock.  A spider-web like system of stress fractures abound on the
surface of the ceiling, perhaps evidence of a small cave-in that took
place above the building with not quite enough force to shatter through. 
An ancient system of counters and cabinets, mark this building as some
sort of shop.  An elaborate archway stands to the north, a stone door set
perfectly within its confines, while to the south a second door stands
sentinel though without the artistic archway surroundings of the other.

Back Room~
Small cubby holes dot the dark peach-colored western wall, creating the
apppearance of a interior of a beehive.  These nooks were obviously
carved during the creation of the room and its placement within the
caverns; each is perfectly square and aligns with all the rest.  Cobwebs
abound, stretched across the miniature openings over countless years by
hungry cave spiders.  A jagged crack, a scar in the rock face, disfigures
the eastern wall, revealing a pair of parallel lines which run straight
and true to a height of six feet.

Small Living Space~
The furnishings of this room are stark while compared to the walls of
this small room.  A single wooden bed covered in moth-eaten and mildewy
blankets, a scarred table and a single three legged chair are the only
comforts within the chamber.  The peach-colored walls however tell sagas
of ages past, not an inch of the rooms seems to be devoid of the ancient
etchings.  Surpisingly little damage seems to have occured to these
inscribings, obviously even the current occupant has tended to them with
care.

Empty crates litter the floor in a hodge-podge of opening frenzy.  Wood

Judging by the size of the crates, items at least the size of a small
goblin must have resided within and based on the amount of packing
material, must have been very fragile indeed.  The walls all remain
barren, save for a sconce holder bolted into the eastern wall, holding

Dead-End Street - Tar'ippal~
This grand chamber stretches out further than most in the city, with
tunnels branching off to the east and south.  A rectangular opening is
visible to the north behind a wrought-iron gate, though what lies in that
direction is unclear.  An @Givory-handled lever@n juts forth from a slot
cut in a metal plate that has been built into the stone next to the gate. 
An enormous dried tumbleweed has been placed against the west wall, its
branches poking out in all directions.

rectangular opening north wrought-iron gate~
Almost perfectly rectangular in shape, the chamber to the north is
flanked by a wrought-iron gate, its central rods contorted and bent into
the shape of a rose.  No handle is visible on the gate, and its bottom
edge fits into a groove in the floor.

ivory-handled lever slot metal plate stone~
Protruding from a brass plate which has been mounted directly into the
stone wall is a thick wooden beam, with a handle of solid ivory
constructed onto its tip.  Whatever sort of mechanism is activated by a
throw of the lever is unknown, as all of its parts remain obscured behind
the slot.

Elevator coding room~
A sturdy oaken platform fifteen feet square dangles perilously in
mid-air, suspended from above by thick, wire-wrapped ropes at each corner. 
A set of wrought-iron gates hang on tracks mounted on the rock wall to
the south on both sides of an opening into an underground tunnel. 
Heavily rusted old machinery is visibly attached to the iron gates along
their outer edges, disappearing into tall gaps mined from the stone face. 
Trailing down from the darkness high above are two cast-iron chains with
slim handles connected to the bottom links.  One of the handles has been
painted red, and one has been painted blue.  A small plaque has been
bolted off to one side of the wooden floor.

Chamber Of Dark Mastery~
Bundles of dry scrolls and musty tomes have been stacked, and where order
fails, crammed into hundreds of alcoves around the walls of the black
stone chamber.  A desk has been pushed against the northern wall, jars
and vases brimming with arcane powders, crystals and various body parts
covering its top.  The stench of death hangs about the room, its pungent
aroma mixing with the arcane reagents to form a near choking aroma.  A
curtain of silk blocks off the only exit from the room, a rampant black
unicorn expertly emblazoned upon its slick surface.

The tunnel widens into a wagon-sized grotto with an oval basin of @cwater@n
set in the eastern wall.  Stalactites and stalagmites cover most of the
cavern's floor and roof, their surfaces coated in sparkling dew.  Between
them, fresh @greeds@n have been spread liberally cross the ground, filling
the air with a rich, earthy aroma.  A small ridge of rock forms a natural

Almost circular in shape, this tunnel which runs deeply underground leads
off in multiple directions.  A smaller cavern is visible to the east,
while the caping maw of a larger chamber stretches off northward.  A
shallow bed of dirt covers the ground, with countless footprints of all
shapes and sizes leading off in a frenzied pattern.

Oppressively hot and reeking of a foul stench, this section of the tunnel
is not a very pleasant place in which to stay for any longer than
absolutely necessary.  Waves of sweltering heat pour in from the east,
where the fires of a blazing forge are visible in the distance.  Clouds
of noxious fumes drift languidly from the west, born of the stinking pit
of boiling tar seething nearby.  Empty mounts, likely fashioned to hold
lanterns long ago, dangle from the ceiling, vacant eyes staring into the
reddish haze of light which creeps through this passageway.

Tar'ippal Lift 'A'~
A sturdy platform of heavy oaken planks dangles precariously in mid-air,
suspended from above by thick, wire-wrapped ropes at each corner.  A pair
of wrought-iron gates are mounted on tracks on either side of the rock
wall to the north; through the gaps in the metalwork, an underground
tunnel visibly meanders northwards.  Bits of rust cling heavily to the
ancient machinery attached to the outer edges of the gates, disappearing
into tall gaps gouged deep into the face of the stone.  Trailing down
from the blackness high above are two cast-iron chains, each bearing a
slim handle attatched to its lowest link, one @rred@n, the other @bblue@n. 
A small plaque has been bolted off to one side of the wooden floor.

sturdy oaken platform~
A square wooden platform fifteen feet long on each side, made of oak
planks that have been reinforced with bands of iron.  The platform sways
slightly as it dangles perilously in mid-air within a vertical shaft,
only held up by four thick ropes in each corner that have been wrapped
with intertwined strands of wire.
~
E
thick wire-wrapped ropes corners~
Four thick lines of heavy rope hang down from the vertical shaft in which
this platform dangles.  Each rope is three inches across, and wrapped in
a protective sheath of intertwined wire strands along its length. 
Numerous portions of the wire wrapping have snapped, their pointy edges
jutting forth in minute lengths.  Where the wire has snapped, individual
strands of rope have frayed, but looks like it will still hold up the
platform with ease.
~
E
set wrought-iron gates north~
Supported on both sides of the north rock face by metal tracks bolted to
its surface, a set of intricate wrought-iron gates hang to prevent the
foolhardy from falling to their deaths when the lift is not present on
that level.  What once may have been a dazzling array of metalworking has
been reduced to a jumble of intersected rods, as most of the individual
tips of metal have been broken off, more than likely used to forge new
weapons or armor by scavengers.
~
E
heavily rusted old machinery gaps~
A complex set of pistons and gears is partially visible sticking out from
gaps cut into the rock face in the northern corners of the vertical shaft. 
Apparently a mechanism for opening and closing the wrought-iron gates
that protect bumbling passersby from falling into the lifter shaft.  Most
of the machinery has thick layers of rust covering its surface, almost
completely through the metal in some portions.  Long scratches on some
gears indicate some attempt at maintenance has taken place since the
lifter was built, though from the looks of things it could all fall apart
at any moment.
~
E
cast-iron chains handles red blue~
Twin cast-iron chains trail down from the inky blackness above this
platform, apparently the controls for this lift.  Each thick chain has a
painted wooden handle attached to its bottom link in order to provide a
steady grip for operation.  One of the ragged wooden handles is red, its
paint heavily worn off and faded.  The other handle has been colored
blue, its chipped surface flaking off with every pull.
~
E
small plaque floor~
Bolted to the wooden platform with heavy iron bolts, this small steel
plaque has resisted all attempts by vandals to mar its face with
derogatory slogans.  Stamped into the metal surface appears to be a
flaunting tale of how the ancient dwarves built this underground lift,
though the only portion that is still completely legible is the primitive
directions on how the lift works.

Tar'ippal Lift 'B'~
A sturdy oaken platform fifteen feet square dangles perilously in
mid-air, suspended from above by thick, wire-wrapped ropes at each corner. 
A set of wrought-iron gates hang on tracks mounted on the rock wall to
the south on both sides of an opening into an underground tunnel. 
Heavily rusted old machinery is visibly attached to the iron gates along
their outer edges, disappearing into tall gaps mined from the stone face. 
Trailing down from the darkness high above are two cast-iron chains with
slim handles connected to the bottom links.  One of the handles has been
painted @rred@n, and one has been painted @bblue@n.  A small plaque has
been bolted off to one side of the wooden floor.

sturdy oaken platform~
A square wooden platform fifteen feet long on each side, made of oak
planks that have been reinforced with bands of iron.  The platform sways
slightly as it dangles perilously in mid-air within a vertical shaft,
only held up by four thick ropes in each corner that have been wrapped
with intertwined strands of wire.
~
E
thick wire-wrapped ropes corners~
Four thick lines of heavy rope hang down from the vertical shaft in which
this platform dangles.  Each rope is three inches across, and wrapped in
a protective sheath of intertwined wire strands along its length. 
Numerous portions of the wire wrapping have snapped, their pointy edges
jutting forth in minute lengths.  Where the wire has snapped, individual
strands of rope have frayed, but looks like it will still hold up the
platform with ease.
~
E
set wrought-iron gates east~
Supported on both sides of the eastern rock face by metal tracks bolted
to its surface, a set of intricate wrought-iron gates hang to prevent the
foolhardy from falling to their deaths when the lift is not present on
that level.  What once have been a dazzling array of metalworking has
been reduced to a jumble of intersected rods, as most of the individual
tips of metal have been broken off, more than likely used to forge new
weapons or armor by scavengers.
~
E
heavily rusted old machinery gaps~
A complex set of pistons and gears is partially visible sticking out from
gaps cut into the rock face in the eastern corners of the vertical shaft. 
Apparently a mechanism for opening and closing the wrought-iron gates
that protect bumbling passersby from falling into the lifter shaft.  Most
of the machinery has thick layers of rust covering its surface, almost
completely through the metal in some portions.  Long scratches on some
gears indicate some attempt at maintenance has taken place since the
lifter was built, though from the looks of things it could all fall apart
at any moment.
~
E
cast-iron chains handles red blue~
Twin cast-iron chains trail down from the inky blackness above this
platform, apparently the controls for this lift.  Each thick chain has a
painted wooden handle attached to its bottom link in order to provide a
steady grip for operation.  One of the ragged wooden handles is red, its
paint heavily worn off and faded.  The other handle has been colored
blue, its chipped surface flaking off with every pull.
~
E
small plaque floor~
Bolted to the wooden platform with heavy iron bolts, this small steel
plaque has resisted all attempts by vandals to mar its face with
derogatory slogans.  Stamped into the metal surface appears to be a
flaunting tale of how the ancient dwarves built this underground lift,
though the only portion that is still completely legible is the primitive
directions on how the lift works.

Grank Tarpit~
Acrid scents escape from tiny bubbles that randomly force their way
through the midnight black tar pooled here.  Ripples circle out each time
gases escape from beneath the dark liquid, ending only when they come in
contact with the outer wall of the chamber of the artificial foot high
wall to the west.  These small waves prove that the tar is thinner than
one would normally imagine, though the cause is uncertain.  The tar pit
continues to the south, where the chamber wall circles towards the west,
confining the liquid once again.

Bounty Office~
The interior of this building is as unimpressive as the exterior - the
granite blocks still bear tool-marks, and the crude planks forming a roof
are roughly tarred.  An oaken door banded with steel appears the best
craftsmanship here, a pair of bulky iron padlocks helping the solid,
oiled bar keep the portal absolutely shut.  From floor to ceiling in the
chamber center, a scarred post stands sentinel - rusted nails still pin a
few scraps of hide adorned with illegible scrawls to the scratched and
stained wood.

Jail~
A shroud of blackness looms over this small cell, lending it the darkness
of a starless midnight.  No ready means of escape is visible, indeed, it
is only by focusing one's eyes that any details at all within the cell
can be discerned.  Granite boulders have been cut into square blocks and
stacked one upon another to provide a thick, massively solid wall.  A
heavy oak door banded with steel seals off this room from the rest of the
world, letting no vestige of light enter the dusky prison.  Two metal
shutters can barely be made out in the door, for both sets of hinges have
been installed on the outside.  A large rock covered in a rancid matting
of straw doubles as a bed, though the stench emanating from its surface
would make one hard-pressed to get any sleep.

granite boulders square blocks wall~
Heavy granite boulders stacked upon one another make up the walls of this
prison, each stone weighing at least a thousand pounds.  Scratches in the
thin lines of mortar display attempts by previous prisoners to open a
hole to the outside, but no visible eyelets can be seen.
~
E
heavy oak door bands steel~
Thick enough to withstand any barrage by a violent prisoner, the oak door
is also reinforced with bands of steel around its breadth.  Scratches in
the door left by previous prisoners document the days they were forced to
endure such brutal conditions.
~

Each about a foot wide, two metal shutters allow access to the cell
without having to open the door.  Evidently used to feed and spy on the
prisoners, their hinges are kept outside as to keep them secured when not
in use.

large rock rancid matting straw bed~
Somewhat rectangular in shape, a granite boulder similar to those which
make up the structure's walls has been unceremoniously left in the middle
of the jail cell, skewed at an odd angle.  Clumps of straw litter its
surface, though it must not have been changed in some time as a rancid
stench wafts from its rotting stalks.

Proving Chamber~
This round, low cavern reeks of sweat.  Squat stumps that appear to be
the shattered remnants of stalacmites surround a wide dip in the floor, a
few inches of dirty water remaining in the natural bowl.  The
crudely-tanned pelt of a black bear hangs as a trophy against the eastern
rockface, spread-eagled by iron spikes.  A pair of guttering torches are
bolted to the stone on either side of the passage to the west,
illuminating skeletal wooden racks.

In the firelight, the mutilated head of the bear almost seems to move. 
The fur is matted and torn, and stiched with rough sinew where a massive
gash was opened in the side of the beast.

Cave Dwelling~
This tiny chamber appears to have been hewn from the mountainside during
mining operations when a vein of ore was extracted.  Apparently converted
into a home for a small goblin, it has wooden shelves lining one wall,
and a narrow strip of padding for a bed.  Small knick-knacks line the
shelving, though none of the scavenged items looks very valuable.  Scraps
of shredded meat and bone line the outside lip of the cavern opening, as
if its occupant had attempted to throw its trash through the hole.

E
tiny chamber vein ore~
Barely expansive enough for its goblin inhabitant and his possessions to
dwell within, this chamber appears to have been cleared out during
mineral excavation.  A jagged scar runs alongside the eastern wall, where
whatever valuable ore once resided here was torn from the stone and
carried away.
~
E
wooden shelves wall shelving knick-knacks scavenged~
A set of shoddy shelves lines the back wall, comprised of three wooden
boards separated by bricks heisted from the roadway running through the
city.  An odd assortment of knick-knacks have been stored here, none of
which appears to have any intrinsic value.
~
E
scraps shredded meat bone trash~
Apparently using the exit from his home to discard his trash, the lip
around the hole leading back into the city is covered in filth.  Bits of
partially chewed food have begun to grow mold along with the splinters of
bone, both of which have begun to smell.
~
E
narrow strip padding bed~
Held down by fist-sized rocks at its corners, a flimsy scrap of padding
serves as a bed for whomever lives within this dusky cave.  Tattered and
frayed around the edges, it appears very uncomfortable.

Grank Street Pet Store~
This shop smells horrid, it is hard to decipher whether the smell is
originating from the owner or the animals kept here.  Dirt and grime
cover the floor, while the counter has an assortment of feeding bowls. 
You can see scratch marks and paw prints etched into the dirt.

The floor, painted a myriad of colors, gives off an appalling odor; how
the shopkeeper can manage is beyond belief.  The shopkeeper shows no
affect to the smell, as if it had no affect on him.
~

counter feeding bowls~
The gime-filled counter set on the far wall, opposite the door.  Behind
it, a foul-smelling goblin waits, ready to do business provided the
customer could endure the smell.  Countless bowls lie on the counter,
every which shape present.  Much like the counter, each bowl is
grime-filled and little care given to make their worth more valuable.

Pump Room~
Centered in the room, a wooden beam stretches from floor to ceiling. 
Slightly rising off the floor, a wheel circumscribes the post; wooden
pegs each lead back to the substantial pole.  The grind of metal against
metal sounds as the wheel-shaped pump completes its turn.  Jutting from
the low ceiling, the stalagmites reach down like jagged teeth.  A row of
old cells lines the back wall of the chamber, apparently unused for quite
some time.  A portcullis nestles in the western wall, a rusty @glever@n
sitting beside it.

beam wheel peg pole post  pump~
The mechanical contraption is pure genius; stemming from just below the
wheel, a rubber tube winds its way out west, through the porticullis. 
The wheel turns in a circular rotation to the right, oozing oil into
the tube.  The wheel, with wooden spokes proceeding to the beam, is made
entirely out of wood and easily maneuverable.  The beam, mostly wood,
minus the part where the wooden pegs meet, stretches from floor to
ceiling; bolted on each end to further sturdy the structure.

1 up ceiling stalagmites teeth~
Reaching for the surface, the stone stalagmites cascade from the ceiling. 
Due to the lowered roof, the dangling rocks look much bigger.  Between
the rocks, shiny crystal shards reflect as the light hits them; they
might even be reachable.
~
E
cell row back wall~
Dust-filled and covered with grime, the cells in back seem to be never
used.  The rusted, barred gates squeak as they turn, the locks long gone
from rust.  Each cell consists of a shredded pelt, a bowl, and a small,
barred window.
~
E
portcullis~
This ancient portcullis looks to be held together mainly by its heavy
covering of rust than by the massive bolts originally intended for that
purpose.  The latticework of iron bars is fused together so tightly that
only a glimpse of the goings-on inside is visible.
