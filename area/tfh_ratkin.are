Damp Earthern Tunnel~
Lined with bits of wood and stone masonry, the earthern tunnel descends
into the darkness below.  Jutting spear shafts and wagon rims have been
braced against the walls, forming a tangle of supporting struts. 
Trickling water oozes down the tunnel sides, staining the wood with a
grimy slime.  Overhead, the tunnel ends in a rubble filled chamber, the
gloom shrouded walls covered in dust and cobwebs.

spear shaft wagon rims struts walls~
A score of spear shafts in various lengths and thicknesses - some with
points and some without - have been driven upright against the cave walls
to create makeshift struts for support.  In place of the spears, on spot
boasts a broken wagon rim, jammed into the dirt for the same purpose.

Damp Earthen Tunnel~
Viscous black loam has been shored together with bits of twisted twine
and wire to form a semi-stable tunnel.  Slim pillars constructed out of
broken spears, driftwood and the occasional pot handle have been braced
against the walls in an effort to add support.  A faint trickle of
brackish water oozes out of the walls in several places, dripping into
the darkness underfoot.  The air smells strongly of damp and decay.

wall loam water~
The dirt is oily and the consistency of wet clay, only the netting of
wire and twine and constant maintenance has prevented it from collapsing
in on itself.  Several paw prints, the size of a small child's hand, have
been left in its surface by a passing creature, probably a rat.  Dark,
foul-smelling water oozes out of the walls beside several of the pillars,
dripping off into the darkness below.
~
E
pillar~
Woven wire and the odd bit of string have been used to hold the slim
pillars together.  Their builder didn't seem too fussed about what
materials to use. Any available and vaguely sturdy item has been
commandeered, from shattered spear shafts to the rusty handles of old
pots and pans, as well as a few bits of driftwood and tree branches. 
Several of the pillars are warped and twisted, perhaps the strain of the
walls is too much for them to cope with.

Damp Earthen Tunnel~
Flagstones and very rusty wagon wheel rims cover the wall, held together
by wire and what appears to be an old fishing net.  Squeezing out from
the gaps is a foul-smelling black earth, oozing with brackish water that
leaves a yellow stain as it runs down the wall.  At several points, the
walls bulge out into a tunnel, a collection of spear shafts, wood, and
even a few large bones thrusted against it in an attempt to halt the
wall's complete collapse.  A knotted rope, secured to a bone thrusting
out of the wall, disappears into a sizable hole in the floor.

Chipped and broken paving stones cover the wall in a haphazard fashion. 
The primitive mosaic pattern is broken by several mismatched rusty wagon
wheels.
~
E
wall water brackish~
Despite the materials used in construction, the walls look sturdy enough. 
However, the constant erosion of water seeping through the loam would
necessitate regular maintanence to keep the structure intact.
~
E
fishing net wire~
Intertwined with the flagstones and wheels is a mass of net and wire,
providing stability to the whole structure.  Floats still attached to the
net indicate it was designed for fishing.
~
E
spear shaft collection wood bones~
Where the wall attempts to encroach on the tunnel, braces have been added. 
Made from any available cast-off piece of wood and animal bones, the
construction looks weak.  The wall is sturdy for now, but it wouldn't be
advisable to remove any of the braces.

The rope is very damp and slippery.  It disappears down a man-sized hole

Ancient Warrens - Beneath a City~
Dark, sludgy flows of foul-smelling liquid ooze along a trough in the
middle of the corridor.  The walls and floor are made from large stone
tiles, many now split and cracked.  The ceiling is supported by narrow
pillars that give the place the appearance of being inside the ribcage of
some great wyrm.  A narrow walkway follows the trough heading east and
west.  A hazy glow, emanating from patches of moss that grow on the grimy
walls, illuminates the area.  Overhead, a knotted rope leads upward into
a hole that has been ripped in the roof, from which a foul rain of dark
liquid cascades.

The dark water that seeps out of the walls throughout the tunnels
collects here into a trough.  Flowing from west to east it follows a
narrow walkway.
~
E
tiles stone large floor~
Grime-covered and mostly broken, large stone tiles cover the floor and
walls.  Slippery due to the water and muck flowing through the area,
your footing is uncertain.
~
E
pillars narrow ceiling~
At strangely regular intervals, narrow pillars rise from the floor,
supporting the ceiling.  Although somewhat worse for the wear, these
appear to have been built by highly skilled artisans.
~
E
moss patches wall~
Living off the grime that flows down the walls, are patches of moss.  Most
appear dead and dried but some clumps glow slightly, providing enough
light to see by.  Only loosely attached, some of the clumps appear to have
fallen off the wall.
~
E
hole rope~
Hanging from a hole in the ceiling is a water drenched knotted rope. 
The hole looks large enough for you to fit through.  The climb might be
difficult, however, due to the water and muck which covers everything,
rope included.
~
E
walkway narrow~
Slippery and rotten in places, a simple walkway runs east and west. 
Barely more than a few planks placed in the mud, it serves its purpose,
to keep the worst of the muck off your feet.

Ancient Warrens - Beneath a City~
The warrens continue into the darkness to the east and west, following a
deep, slow moving trough of foul smelling liquid.  Debris and a few
decaying creatures float amid the river of muck.  Along the wall, pairs
of supporting pillars rise up and join together in the centre of the
ceiling.  A few scratch marks have been left in the dirty walls, perhaps
from a passing creature.

E
trough liquid~
Foul smelling liquid oozes along the wide stone trough, flowing slowly in
an easterly direction.  The remains of dead creatures and rotting debris
fill the channel, forming small dams that create lakes of putrescent
water.  After a while, the water pressure becomes too great and they burst
with a gurgling rush.
~
E
debris creatures muck~
The bloated carcass of a huge rat slowly floats down the channel of filthy
muck.  Filling the trough are bits of broken leather, leaves and other
pieces of debris.  Most lay rotting away slowly, half-submerged in
the goop.  As the waters ooze by, something catches the light, faintly
sparkling in the murky waters.
~
E
pillars~
Crafted from a pale, cream-colored stone, the slender pillars rise up and
meet at keystones set into the roof.  Their bleached appearance gives the
area the look of being inside the ribcage of a giant serpent.  Carved
into each of the keystones is a starburst pattern.
~
E
scratch marks walls~
Under a generous layer of grime, probably splattered from the mucky waters
of the trough, lie the dusky red clay bricks of the walls.  Scratch marks
cover several of the bricks in swirling patterns.
~
E
1 east~
The warrens appear to open out a bit eastwards, however the gloom of the
area prevents any real detail from being seen from here.
~
E
1 west~
Westward a faint illumination emanates from the brick walls.  The pale
glow seems to cast as many shadows as it creates light.  A cord or rope
dangles from the roof, perhaps a way onwards.  Beyond the rope, the
tunnel is swallowed up by darkness.

Ancient Warrens - Meeting of Under Passages~
In the center of this cavern, four slender stone pillars support the
convex roof above.  Set into each wall are red brick archways, framing
troll-sized openings.  Spilling into the cavern from the north and south
openings are stone troughs filled with burbling water, and from the west
a slow-moving ditch of sludge and grime.  A square-shaped pool in the
centre of the cavern forms the nexus for these waterways.  From the pool,
the now murky waters surge down a narrow but deep channel along the
center of the eastern tunnel.

What can now be seen, however, are only splashes of form and colour, a
pale reflection of former splendour.
~

The bricks are stained a dirty brown along the lower sides, as if
countless creatures have brushed against them.  Higher up, the walls look
less dirty even though they have a film of grime covering them.

Each trough is identical in construction, apart from a symbol at its
entrance to the room, denoting north or south (the direction from which
it enters).  The water is relatively clear, revealing the base of each
duct, worn smooth over many years.
~
E
sludge grime~
The semi-liquid contents of the ditch emit foul-smelling gasses as they
creep onwards.  This channel appears to be a sewage outlet, although the
contents appear even more repulsive than even that would suggest.  The
noxious fumes really are overwhelming.
~
E
square pool~
The tiling around the edges of the pool are in poor condition, although
still of a recognizably pretty design.  Above the water level, the
sides of the pool are caked in layers of muck, splashed up over many
years from the turmoil within the pool.
~

From the east, the sounds of rushing waters echo.  A hazy mist surounds the
opening, making it difficult to see much more than a vague outline of the

Ancient Warrens - Beneath a City~
Shrouded in gloom, the chamber is littered with rocks and a scattering of
shattered bricks.  Under the rubble, the floor is cobbled, although many
of the stones are missing.  A dull grey archway frames cobweb covered
openings in each wall.  Oozing foul-smelling liquid bubbles and sloshes
in a circular pool in the chamber's center, a grime-encrusted trough
allowing the sludge to flow onward out of the eastern tunnel.  The
remains of an iron grill lie against the eastern wall, the metal twisted
and corroded beyond use.

Shattered from the walls, the bricks and rubble lie scattered across the

against the bricks with some force.  A layer of foul muck covers most of
the rubble, obscuring much of the cobbled floor with a carpet of filth.
~
E
pool trough liquid~
Bubbling liquids surge up from an underground source, causing the central
pool to bubble and boil.  A foul-smelling cloud of mist hangs over the
water.  A chisel-marked trough runs eastward, carrying the semi-solid
liquids from the the chamber.

The remaining rust-covered metal appears to have been melted and sundered

Ancient Warrens - Small Chamber~
Mounds of stone and earth fill the chamber, spilled into the room from
the collapsed western passageway.  Against the northern wall is a small
raised dais, half buried in the rubble.  The shattered remains of several
pillars lie on the ground, cracking the dusky brown flagstones of the
floor as they fell.  Small, pale fungi sprout on the slip alongside bright
patches of moss and lichen, an indication that the cave-in is not a
recent event.  A narrow ditch, filled with brackish liquid, runs in from
the east and out the southern corridor.

mounds stone earth~
Coated in a lush layer of moss and lichen, it is clear that the mounds of
earth and rubble have been here some time.  Most of the debris has poured
in from the collapsed western tunnel, although some appears to have
fallen from fissures that spread across the roof.
~

Tons of rock and earth have filled the passageway from a cave-in. 
Several of the lighter rocks at the apex of the mounds look like they
might be moveable, allowing progress westward.
~

dais~
Cockle and pipi shells adorn the sides of the dais.  Barely over three
feet in height, a shallow depression, dry and dust covered, has been
carved into its top.
~
E
dusky brown flagstones floor pillars~
The collapsing pillars have gouged deep grooves in the cobbled floor. 
Several areas of flagstones have been shattered beyond recognition.  Even
the ones that avoided this destruction show signs that time and the dank
conditions are taking their toll, tendrils of cracks covering most of
them.  Where the earth has been revealed pale fungi sprout, pushing up
and cracking the cobbles as they grow.
~
E
pale fungi moss lichen~
Sprouting across the rubble and floor are a field of fungi.  The delicate
pale yellow stems are capped with blue-gray umbrellas, dotted with
cream-colored spots.  At the slightest disturbance, the fungi release a
cloud of earthen-colored spores.  Around the fungi patches grows a carpet
of long-fronded sphagnum moss and wrinkled gray lichen.

Ancient Warrens - Narrow Tunnel~
Running down the middle of the cobbled floor in this narrow tunnel, a
wide stone ditch flows with fast moving water.  The walls of the
passageway have been constructed from a dusky red clay brick, cracked and
pitted with age.  Spreading across many of the damp cobblestones are
patches of red and orange lichen, thriving in the dank growing conditions. 
Another tunnel heads westward into the darkness, it appears to be drier
than this area.  Southward, the tunnel continues, leading to perhaps the
source of the waters.

E
cobbled floor ditch water~
Cut from grey stone, the cobbles have been polished smooth by the passing
years and water spray, so they gleam like marble.  Each cobblestone fits
perfectly with its neighbour, leaving only a needle-thin gap between each
pair.  Waters splash across the cobblestones from the burbling ditch,
channeling water northward.  The foaming liquid comes close to spilling
over the edge of the ditch and flooding the passageway.
~
E
red orange brick~
Most of the ancient brickwork shows signs of its now-decrepit nature. 
Cracks run across the bricks where the pressures of time are eroding the
clay.  Broken bits of the bricks and piles of red dust rest against the
walls base, collected from the crumbling structures.
~
E
lichen~
The lichen spreads out across the damp floor like a red and
orange-colored carpet.  Fine tendrilss of lichen pry into the cracks and
crevices between the flagstones and bricks, in an effort to gain some
nutrients from the thin layer of soil there.
~
E

The tunnel is narrow, with a low arched roof to it.  The walls have been
constructed from dusky red bricks.  The dry floor is bare of the normal
lichen and mosses found in the damper areas.

The tunnel follows the waterway northwards into the gloom.  From further
along the passageway, the sounds of fast flowing water can be heard.

It appears that the tunnel begins to widen to the south, although details
are difficult to see from here.

Ancient Warrens - Sink Hole~
Foul smelling, brackish liquid flows out of clay pipes in the northern
and southern walls, combining with a central ditch to form a fast-flowing
stream.  The tiled floor is slick, covered in slimy algae and pale fungi. 
The waters rush eastward toward a wide sinkhole, forming a waterfall as
it tumbles off into the darkness below.  A greasy mist fills the air and
the rumbling of the water drowns out any other sound.  Across the
sinkhole, the warrens appear to continue, although the mist obscures much
of the detail of what lies beyond.

Although very old, the clay pipes are in reasonably good condition,

Beneath many layers of grime are the still-discernible marks of a

The walls around the sinkhole are slick with aeons of accumulated slime,
leaving no possibility for handholds.  The narrow ledge alongside the

On A Metal Grate~
With a roar, the waters overhead fall in a whitewater torrent to form a
wide waterfall.  At floor level, a grate has been constructed, anchored
to the walls intersecting the flow.  Piles of debris and rubble have been
snared from the water, caught in the steel net.  Under the grate, the
cascade falls into the darkness and is lost to view.  From an opening to
the west, another muddy stream flows to the grate and downward into the
darkness.

Spread across the floor, the iron grill catches all manner of debris that

Ancient Warrens - Narrow Tunnel~
The narrow tunnel winds through the darkness in an east-west direction. 
The walls and floor are crafted from red clay bricks, many of them
cracked and crumbling.  Several alcoves have been set into the walls,
empty save for a generous layer of dust.  Across the low ceiling is the
remains of a fresco, most of it water damaged and caked in grime.

walls floor red clay bricks~
Time and lack of care are slowly eroding the brickwork, leaving only the
crumbled red dust behind.  Tendrils of fine cracks cover most of the
bricks, an indication that their strength is not as it once was.  The
cobbled floor is littered with the brick dust that coats the grey-colored
stones.  Across the dust are countless tracks, left by small clawed
creatures, most likely the ample rats that are found here.
~
E
alcoves dust~
Each alcove is only about a foot in size and about as half as deep. 
Arch-shaped, they appear to have once been used to hold a light source. 
Smoke stains cover the curved roof and a faint layer of dusty grey ash
coats the floor.
~
E
fresco ceiling~
Barely any of the fresco remains, only a few colored tiles in a sea of
grime.  What their design was is long since lost, only the predominantly
blue tiles giving some clue that it was of the sea or sky.

Ancient Warrens - Narrow Tunnel~
A circular pool fills the floor of the three way junction.  A torrent of
murky water cascades out of countless clay pipes on the southern wall
into the pool.  It swirls around before rushing northward along a wide
stone ditch that has been constructed in the center of the northern
tunnel.  Set in each of the four corners of the room, stone gargoyles
squat atop slender pillars.

The clay pipes appear to have been built into the wall at the time of

Each pillar has been intricately carved and is relatively untouched by
the passage of time.  Patterns of sea creatures are discernible in the
carvings, petering out towards the top of each pillar.  The gargoyles
stare balefully into the room from their perches in each corner.  They
provoke a feeling of being watched, as if still protecting this room
after their makers have long since disappeared.

Broken bricks and mounds of earth lie scattered across the floor of the

Ancient Warrens - Narrow Tunnel~
Barely wide enough for two men to walk abreast, the narrow passageways
have been constructed from a dusky red brick.  Every five or six paces a
small alcove, holding small brass sconces, has been set into the wall. 
Overhead, the ceiling has been hacked from natural stone, a few seams of
smoky white crystal running across its surface.

Baked from a red-brown clay, the uneven bricks have been held together
for countless years by the greyish colored mortar, liberally spread
between them.  However, the lack of maintanance has begun to erode their
support, leaving broken bricks and mortar to collect at the base of the
wall.
~
E

Cut into the walls are several shallow alcoves.  In each of the alcoves
are small brass scounces, empty but covered in a dusty black soot,
indication that they have seen some use.  Smoke stains mark the walls
above the alcoves, some reaching as high as the arched roof above.

Hacked from the natural rock, the ceiling has been left bare and
unadorned.  Running acorss the surface are the glinting seams of a
smoky white crystal, perhaps quartz.

The gleaming crystals that make up the seams are hexagonal in shape and
jut out of the rock in dense clusters.  Smoke-white in colouration, they
appear to be a stone simillar to quartz.  Fine structural cracks run
across many of the crystals.

Ancient Warrens - Beneath a City~
Rocks and mounds of dirt litter the passageway, remnants of the cave-in
that sealed the eastern one.  In the western wall, an archway of red
clay bricks opens into a narrow tunnel, leading off from this main one. 
More debris blocks the northern way, although it is possible to
squeeze past the rocks and mounds of dirt and continue in that direction. 
Southward, the warrens seem more clear of the rubble.

rocks mounds dirt~
The broken rocks and damp dirt have spilled out of the eastern
passageway, filling most of the area.  The eastern passage is completely
blocked with heavy-looking boulders and sharp-edged stones.  At first
glance, several of the stones seem to be coated in dried blood, however,
closer inspection reveals that blood-red lichen has made its home across
their surface.

The eastern passageway has been completely sealed by tons of rock and

the cave-in.

Southward the warren is more clear from rocks and rubble, allowing ease

Ancient Warrens - Beneath a City~
Piles of stone tiles, chunks of rocks and rotting sacks fill this room. 
Splintered flakes of rock chips spill out across the cobbled floor. 
Rusting in a heap beside the stones are a collection of iron spikes and
chisels, probably used to split and shape the stones into tiles.  In the
southern wall, a shallow stone basin has been built into the wall.  A
foul smelling rust-colored liquid fills the basin to just below its lip.

Shattered rocks and bricks spill out across the floor.  Open fissures in
the roof and walls have sent a cascade of rubble into the passageway,
partially blocking the southern and completely sealing the northern
tunnels.  Several pools of brackish water have been formed by slowly
trickling ribbons of oozing liquid seeping down the walls.  A layer of
bright green slime coats much of the lower section of the walls, enjoying

Covered with broken slabs or rock and earth fallen from the fissures
above, the cobbled floor is in danger of vanishing completely.  The force
of the cave-in split and cracked most of the visible cobblestones,
reducing some to a collection of chips and fine stone powder.  Several
pools of brackish water have formed in the shallows left by the
destruction.

Like open wounds, the gapping fissures trickle ribbons of water down
their fractured surfaces.  Shards of rock thrust out of the walls,
spear-like and precariously balanced.  Overhead, a latticework of cracks
dances across the rocks.

Water trickles down the sides of the walls and forms into shallow pools

Ancient warrens - Beneath the city~
Four slender pillars support the shallow-domed roof of this chamber.  In
the center of the cobblestone floor, a faded fresco depicts a stormy sea. 
Across the cupola overhead run ribbons of crystal, set in the stone by
copper lining, beaten into the shape of forked bolts of lightning.  An
archway opens into a narrow tunnel westward, while the warrens continue
to the east.

Each pillar is wreathed in a complicated pattern, reminiscent of waves of
water.  This pattern seems to have been achieved by infinitely detailed
carving, yet it creates a very simple effect, soothing yet mesmeric to
behold.  The roof, supported by these columns, curves upward from the

Each cobble has been precisely placed, fitting next to its neighbours
almost seamlessly.  Where the fresco in the center of the room begins or

witnessing a stormy sea.

As was intended in the construction, the overall impact of the lightning
is electric.  The crystal picks out any light in the chamber, capturing

Ancient Warrens - Decaying Mounds~
Bundles of reeds have been piled up in rotting heaps against the southern
wall, the pungent aroma of rot and decay hovering in the air.  Broken
crockery lies scattered around the bundles, ruined beyond repair. 
Jutting out of the brick walls are slender clay pipes, most plugged with
long wicks of moss that steadily drip water.

The thick, pungent smell of rot and decay rises from the mounds of

mounds, perhaps feeding on some of the less dessicated stems.

The shattered remains of fine porcelain vases and pots lie scattered

Mounds of the dying reeds and sacking line the earthern floor of the room. 
Bits of broken tools, bricks and an occasional bone lie scattered

Ruined Hallway - Ancient Warrens~
Slender blue stone pillars rise from the walls on either side of the long
hall, adding support to the vaulted ceiling.  Hexagonal cobblestones cut
from a blue-grey stone have been set in the floor, each edge perfectly
aligned with its neighbour.  Across the walls are the remains of a
fresco, most of the tiles faded or lost altogether.  An opening in the
eastern wall leads into a narrow tunnel.  In the northern wall, an arch
of dusky red bricks frames a blue stone door.

Around the walls of this circular chamber are brightly colored frescoes,

Ancient Warrens - Narrow Tunnel~
A narrow tunnel, built from dusky red brick, heads in a easterly
direction.  A semi-circular basin juts out from the western wall, filled
to the lip with a clear liquid.  Along the northern wall are set five
alcoves, each one containing an empty tarnished copper sconce.  A
smooth-surfaced door, crafted of blue-grey stone, splits the wall to the
south, offering entrance and exit in that direction.

Slender stone pillars rise up from the flooded floor of the chamber to

perhaps a warning of dangers beyond.

Flooded Tunnel~
A surge of brackish liquid flows in from the north; over a foot in depth,
it tugs and pulls at anything in its wake.  Overhead, the rocks of the
tunnel have been braced by several very rusty iron beams. Bent and warped,
they lack the strength they once possessed.  A dusting of purple-hued
mold coats the dank walls, the air filled with a sweet-smelling hazy
cloud.

The tunnel walls and ceiling have been hacked from the surrounding dark
loam, leaving the occasional large stone exposed.  The floor of the

ending at a small balcony that looks over the passageway.  Eastward, the

A raised walkway surrounds a wide sinkhole in the middle of the tunnel. 
Seven alcoves, approximately the size of an average human have been
carved into the surrounding walls.  In the four facing the northern
tunnel are small stone statues of what appear to be mutated rats...the
other three are empty.  Brackish water swirls in from the northern
opening, forming a slow moving whirlpool as it drains down into the

The bottom of the sinkhole is covered in a lattice of cracks, allowing

A faint glow emanates from tiny seams of crystals that pocket the walls.

A huge cave-in has sealed the passageway to the north with mounds of

This small pocket of space is all that remains of the passageway that
once ran in an east-west direction.  Slabs of rock have cascaded down,

Earthen Tunnel~
The narrow earthen tunnel continues to wind through the darkness.  The
hard-packed floor shows signs of untold numbers of clawed feet scrabbling
over it.  Dull light flickers from fading oil lamps that have been set
into the walls.  Overhead, a latticework of ropes and half-rotted nets
has been stretched, held in place with all manner of sharp sticks, iron
pegs and an occasional spearhead.  Boxes and narrow barrels, as well as
countless iron scraps and cast-offs have been tucked into the webbing,
forming an unstable-looking storage area.  In the southern wall, a narrow
wooden door has been set, while the twisting corridors disappear into the
darkness in all other directions.

furniture have been piled up against the walls, several of the stacks
spilling out across the floor.  Dirty-red fungi sprout on several of the
more decayed mounds, their caps shimmering with a speckled coat of
moisture, as if someone had recently watered them.  The sickly-sweet
smell of decay fills the air.

Rotting bundles of sacking and poorly cured animal skins cover the floor.

Narrow Passageway - Before A Small Door~
Running parallel along the eastern and western walls of the oblong
chamber are narrow shelves formed from the natural rock.  Their smooth
surface shows no hint of a tool cut, suggesting that somehow the shelves
were formed by other means.  Filling the shelves to almost overflowing
are tins, boxes, crates and a crammed jumble of vases and crockery, all
shoved in without any semblance of care or apparent order.  Set in the
northern and southern walls are plain wooden doors, their hinges rusting
in the damp conditions.

Earthen Tunnel~
The damp earthen tunnel winds through the darkness, dipping and rising as
it passes from east to west.  Clumps of loam lie piled in several places,
perhaps markers or the beginnings of new tunnels.  Overhead, moldy ropes
and nets have been strung across the ceiling, torn beyond much use; at
one point in time, they may have added some support to the low roof.

Earthen Tunnel~
The tunnel ends abruptly at a solid-looking wall of rock.  A glimmering
vein of quartz runs down the middle of the western wall, some of the
larger crystals flecked with a purple-hued ore.  Peppering the walls and
floor are deep scratch marks, where the tunnel's builders have searched
for a way around the rocky impasse.  Some strange looking shadows appear
on the wall to the south.

Stone Chamber~
Water trickles down the sides of this rough stone chamber, draining away
through a small crack in the southern wall.  A head-high pile of rocks
and mud form a barricade to the north, preventing passage in that
direction.  Beside the door are two alcoves, in each a beaten copper oil
lamp, their wicks spluttering out a faint light in the damp conditions. 
The eastern wall is made from packed earth, an archway has been set with

Small Storage Room~
The smell of old herbs and unrelenting damp fill the air of the room.  At
one stage, it looks as if it was used for storage or even as a cloakroom. 
Now, it stores little more than dust.  Several wooden racks line the
western wall, covered in a thick mantle of dust; they appear to hold
little more than rags.  A sturdy bookcase stands to the north, the
tattered remnants of paper and the half-rotted spines of several books
all that remain on its shelves now.  An opening in the eastern wall leads

On the western wall a wooden wagon wheel has been attached by iron

Stone Chamber~
Though bare, this chamber could accommodate a wagon with ease; however in
its current state it barely has enough room to fit a small pony.  Boxes
and crates have been piled into a crude throne against the western wall. 
A rotting tarp, bundles of broken, grime-covered wooden wheels and split
barrels lie scattered against the eastern wall, interspersed with tangled
netting and a few bits of smooth driftwood.  Propped against the southern
corner is an ornate door, its ironwork now badly rusted.  A strong smell
of rotting fish fills the air.  Set in the northern wall is a stone door,
whilst to the south a stone passageway continues into the darkness.

End of the Stone Corridor~
A short stone corridor heads northward and opens into a wagon-sized
chamber.  To the east, the passageway becomes increasingly natural.  The
stones have a marbled finish to them, slick and smooth; they look as if
water once flowed through here.  A few columns of rock form further to
the east as the passage opens up into a cavern and ends at an
underground river.

Before An Underground River~
The smooth walls and floor of the cavern have been created by years of
flowing water, leaving them with a marbled appearance.  Stretching
eastward, a small stony beach spreads out toward an underground river. 
Thrust into the stones before the river is a long rusted iron pole. 
Through a loop at the top of the pole, a grime-covered rope has been tied. 
At the base of the pole, another rope in similar condition has been
attached; both ropes disappear across the river, forming a crude bridge. 
A narrow corridor heads west, two stone columns flanking the opening.

An Underground River~
The swirling dark waters of the underground river churn through a tunnel
which has been carved out by the river's earlier incarnations.  Flowing
from the west, it continues speeding along eastward toward an unknown
destination.  Under the black wash, rocks and hidden whirlpools snag and
tear at anything that passes within their grasp.

Pebble beach - Before An Underground River~
The riverbank is covered in countless small stones and drifts of sand,
dredged up by the river flowing from the west.  A jagged crevice in the
eastern wall of the cavern appears to open out into natural caves. 
Thrust into the stone beside the riverbank is a long rusty iron pole. 
Wrapped around the pole and tied with a looping knot is an old, grimey
rope; another rope in similar condition has been attached to a loop of
metal at the top of the pole.  Both ropes stretch across the river,
barely clearing its surface, forming a very crude bridge.

E
jagged crevice natural caves~
Shifting rocks in the far wall have created a small cave-in, leaving a
crevice.  Barely half a foot wide and less than an arm span in length,
the gap appears to have a tunnel beyond it.  Filled with shadows, the
tunnel heads in a north and south direction.  Toward the north, it
appears to open out into another cave; however, there is no apparent way
to reach the tunnel from here.

long rusty iron pole~
Thrust through the sand and rock, the rusty iron pole is over six feet in
length and a handspan wide.  Rust and grime coat its surface, leaving it
with an brittle appearance.  The top of the spike ends in an iron loop,
into which a waterlogged rope has been fastened.  Another rope has been
attached to the base of the spike, tied with a large knot.  Both ropes
stretch westwards across the river, forming a basic rope bridge.

Only the size of a cloak room, the walls and floor here are rough and
unfinished.  A solid stone slab sits in the center of the diminutive

Damp Earthen Tunnel~
Dripping tendrils of some viscous liquid run down the oozing mud walls,
the low ceiling is hung with the roots of dead trees and festooned with
broken bits of animal bones.  Splintered sections of wagon wheels, spear

in a effort to prevent the tunnel from collapsing.  Rotting fir needles
lie in piles across the mud-churned floor, the earthy aroma of decay

Under the Ruined City~
The circular chamber has been constructed of slabs of stone; the roof, a
tangled conglomeration of beams and rock, barely holds from the building
above's collapse.  Shattered pillars and debris cover the floor creating
a sizeable mound of earth and stone that blocks the northern section of
the room.  The stonework in the southern wall has been pried apart and a
dank tunnel leading into the darkness lies beyond.  A spiral staircase
descends from the center of the room; the steps, crumbling from age, are
covered in broken masonry.

The spiral staircase, astonishingly enough, holds together and makes its
way down to the floor below.  Each of the stone steps in covered in rock
and rubble and looks like its ready to give way at any moment.

Under the Ruined City - Spiral Staircase~
Rocks and broken wooden beams partially block the stairwell, covering the
decaying, stone stairs to create a slow journey in either direction. 
Clumps of lichen spread over the walls, giving it a mottled coloration. 
The stone stair risers become increasingly rubble-filled, the steps
buried beneath the sea of stone.  The descending stairs appear to end
a few quick jumps later; a massive cave-in blocks the way.  Hacked from
the northern wall is a narrow tunnel, allowing further travels under the
city.

The stairs, both descending and ascending, are painted with rubble and
debris, making it difficult to travel along them.  The stairs abrubtly end
with a cave-in; enormous, compressed boulders conceal the path below.

The color of the lichen varies from gray to green and even, in places,

Under the Ruined City~
Similar to the ruined chamber above, this circular room is mosty filled
with rubble and debris from the city above.  The shattered remnants of an
ascending flight of steps lies against the northern wall, the mounds of
rock above it sealing the stairwell.  Cut from the stone-littered floor
is an earth-packed hole, the walls fitted with stones and planks in order
to prevent a cave-in.  Cobwebs and dust cloak the walls and floor, an
indication that the chamber was sealed for some time.
