0 0 19 Abandoned Village~
.So long dead that none but a few remember its name, a fishing village
lies abandoned far north on the Elhanni.  Its people lived on the fringe
of starvation, never having enough to eat except what they took from the
river.  Then, one day, they were gone.  Few who have investigated the
matter have returned, though it is said an old fisherman knows the tale...~

.~

0 0 19 Abbey on the Hill~
.Well before the dwarven migration from the Everwinter Mountains, before
even Talidar reached the elven lands, an ancient city thrived on the
banks of the Ice Wash river.  They used the grains and animals of their
fertile surroundings to grow rich and transformed their city to one of
stone and steel.  Aggressive expansionists, they pushed outward and
dominated the nearby tribal factions, demanding sacrifices and tributes
from them.  As their technology grew so did their cruelty.  So many blood
sacrifices were paid that they attracted the notice of the trio of dark
gods.  Their blessings enabled the city to control an ever larger
territory until they reached near to the dwarven lands.  War ensued;
bloody and brutal it took a great toll on both sides, weakening both
until they stood poised at the brink of ruin.  The city under the
influence of the dark gods built a grand abbey to the gods in a hope to
win favour and win the war.

Before it was quiet complete the last great host that the dwarves could
muster descended upon the city.  For the first time the dwarves were
aided by a handful of elven rangers, the cooperated finally overwhelming
the forces of the city.  As its people fell to the onslaught, the priests
and sorcerers falling back to the abbey where they made their final stand
defiant to the last, without mercy the combined army killed them all
their bodies burn within the dark abbeys walls, the flames they said
turning black as the high priest was consumed.

Despite the efforts of both elven and Dwarven priest the land around
where the abbey was constructed refused the consecrations of the light
gods, remaining tainted by the will of Taraskatt.  The elves and dwarfs
tore down the rest of the city, replanting the and with forest and grass,
leaving only the blackened cemetery of the abbey standing.  The dwarven
nation retreated into its holds; weakened by the wars the goblins had
started to take their strongholds, overrunning the isolated clan houses. 
Some say the gobliniods were aided in part by the dark gods in revenge
for the fall of their great city.  A great sickness fell upon both the
races, the elven priests were able to contain much of the plague but the
unfortunate dwarves died in horrific numbers, often entire communities
were lost.

Not content with his ruination of the land Taraskatt rose up the dead,
infusing them with death and disease.  With this undead army he rebuilt
the abbey using its graveyards with a tireless supply of builders.

0 0 19 Abhanthorp~
.There have been tales told through the ages of an ancient magic cast an
eon ago during a time of trouble...during a time when the elves wandered
all the lands of the world and a primitive evil arose to contest their
sovereignty.  This arcane evil held great power and ravaged the world at
will, its other inhabitants fleeing in terror before it.  Then came a
time when the mages of the world gathered together.  Using the great
stones to portal from place to place, they cast powerful magics, sealing
the various realms away in safety.  Ages passed and the magics began to
fade.  The world recovered and the realms were unsealed, one area at a
time, until all but a few were revealed.  Civilization once again began
to thrive.

Recently, whispers of ancient chantings have been heard...or rumored to
have been heard...west of Chiiron, and a twisting trail leading northward
has been revealed.  What lies beyond is a mystery, as few have yet dared
to brave the unknown.

HOW TO LEARN NEW SKILLS OR IMPROVE EXISTING ONES

Improving skills through instruction uses up practice points, and costs money.
You receive a certain amount of practice points, in decreasing amounts, every
time you level until you are level 10.  These are 'free' practice points.
For the rest of your life, you only receive practices randomly when you use
your skills or cast spells.  You can also randomly improve a skill level
through real-world experience in using a particular skill/spell.  How smart
you are (intelligence and wisdom) contributes to how often you gain practice
points or improves.

Some skills will require you to be proficient in a lesser skill before you may
be taught an advanced skill.  (ie:  You must learn to crawl before you can
walk)  Pre-requisites are displayed when examining ability lists.

To increase your skill level in a particular ability, you must find someone
who teaches that particular ability.  Most teachers can be found in towns,
although some advanced skills might require a quest or task to locate the
teacher or else receive his/her instruction.  Type 'practice' to find out
what someone is capable of teaching you.  If the person teaches the skill you
wish to learn, type 'practice <skill>' to attempt to learn that skill.

0 0 7 Aelyoni~
.@BAelyoni@n - Goddess of Nature and all that is green and verdant.

Deep within the lush multi-coloured canopy, hidden amongst the aging
fauna in the heart of the forest lives the entity known to all who
worship the ways of nature-Aelyoni, guardian of nature.  She is known to
her followers as the Lady of the Forest, or sometimes simply as Mother
Nature.  She loves and looks over all plant-life and most animals in the
realm, but has a special place in her heart for the verdant green forests. 
It is for this reason that she has attracted a large following of vodekyn
and wood-elven followers, and indeed, many woodsmen and hunters choose to
follow her because of her interests in the woodlands and the animals that
make it their home.

Not a forest in the land has escaped the gentle hands of Aelyoni or her
followers.  Aelyoni believes that natural beauty is perfection in a
tangible form.  Any unnecessary altering of this natural beauty is
considered to be a perversion though Aelyoni grudgingly allows the races
to use what resources they need to survive.  Aelyoni recognizes the need
for both prey and predators and the need for wood and such to make homes
and stay warm.  Part of the natural order of life is for death to take
its toll so that others may survive whether the entity is plant or animal. 
Wanton destruction is not tolerated in any form.  Those who kill or maim
the land for pleasure or for sport are an immediate enemy, and the vyan
race especially are seen as enemies of her people.

Those who believe they have seen Aelyoni claim that she has appeared to
them as a snowy white wolf of large size, or as a beautiful elven archer
with hair of honey-gold and a longbow made of white birch that seems
almost alive.  Though even without seeing her, there is not a woodsman of
good heart who has not felt her presence.  Her symbol is that of the wolf
that she sometimes likes to appear as, snowy white with an almost
shimmering coat, and eyes of brilliant green, representing the nature
that she holds so dearly.~

@C@CDESCRIPTION@n

This is used in conjunction with entering/leaving triggers in acode, etc. 
You flag the direction which you want it to kick in.  For example, you
create an action with a leaving trigger, and you flag the 'north' option. 
When someone leaves the room via the north exit, that action will be

@CDESCRIPTION@n

This command allows you to replace a commonly used phrase by a shortened
version.  Anywhere you type the abbreviation it replaces it with the
substitution.  If the first letter of the abbreviation is a * then the
alias only takes affect if the first word on the line.  

@CEXAMPLES@n:

alias df drink fountain  : to drink from a fountain, type df.
alias df                 : deletes df alias.

Preceding an alias with an * makes the alias only take effect if it is
the first thing typed on a line.

.~

0 0 22 Alignment~
.The following is a listing of the nine alignments.  Definitions and
examples are contained therein.

@cLawful Good@n - Characters of this alignment believe that when people
respect society's laws and try to help one another, society as a whole
prospers.  Player's of this alignment believe that by following the Law, 
they will do the most Good, and will follow rules and laws even if 
they may personally feel that a particular law or rule is wrong. 
(An extreme example of this conflict might be a samurai, who follows 
his Lord's command, EVEN if he thinks its wrong, then commits 
seppuku afterwards to display his personal protest.) Lawful good 
players would most likely gravitate to clans of like mind, believing 
them to be first and best (perhaps only) way to do the most good.

@cLawful Neutral@n - As long as there are laws and rules, this character 
will follow them with no hesitation.  The people that the Law has put 
in charge of the character know better than the character what is right 
or wrong. The player 'knows' this, because the Law put those people in 
charge, and the Law is always right. Therefore, such a player will 
follow all orders without question, and believe themselves to be doing 
the right thing, because following the rules will eventually make 
everything work out.

@cLawful Evil@n - This character believes in using laws and rules for his
own gain.  Even if the character is on the bottom rung of the ladder,
they will follow the rules, and learn to use the rules to benefit
themselves and 'get ahead'.  A lawful evil being would be an iron-fisted
tyrant (like Hitler), part of the tyrants regime (a Nazi) or a devious
individual who uses the rules to get what they want (perhaps a lawyer
working for the mob, or someone willfully using laws to protect their own
unethical behavior.) Lawful evil character's would join a clan whose
rigid structure could be used to benefit themselves, or whose iron
control of resources would make him or her powerful by association.

@cNeutral Good@n - This character sees the need for good.  He or she uses
laws and rules when they will do good, and ignores them when they seem to
be causing harm.  They do what they think is right at the time.  A lord
who violates orders from his king to destroy something he sees as evil
would be considered neutral good.  A player of this alignment might join
a good clan if it seems that clan might allow them to accomplish the most
good (or might _not_ join a clan for the same reason), but unlike a
lawful good character, the NG character might still go against certain
decisions of the clan (covertly or overtly), if they thought the decision
or rule was wrong.

@cTrue Neutral@n - True neutral characters dont much care for good or
evil, prefering to stay on the sidelines.  As long as the law doesnt
intrude upon their goals, they abide by it -- when it doesn't, they
ignore it.  A mercenary who fights only for the coin, caring nothing for
either side, would be truly neutral.  They might join a clan if they
stood a good chance of gain without becoming entangled in 'causes'.

@cNeutral Evil@n - The only interest of this character is getting ahead.
Whether its by means that are legal or questionable, they take advantage
of it.  They don't have the every-man-for-himself quality of a chaotic
evil, but they have been known to betray friends to the authorities for
personal gain.  They might join a clan if that would benefit them the
most, but would leave if the benefits they perceived faded or did not
develop as planned.

@cChaotic Good@n - Strongly independent, these individuals have no use
for any law or rule.  Their own moral code guides their actions and doing
good is a personal thing.  Any means justifies the end result if that
result is goodness.  A vigilante is an example of chaotic good.  Chaotic
good characters usually think that rules and laws hurt more than they
help...  they may agree with everything the laws stand for, but they
think setting down laws is the first step toward ruining the cause.  Laws
are part of the problem, not the solution, and as such, this character
would rarely join an order or organization, though they might if the the
clan represented a very loose alliance or shared philosophy.  A group of
characters who acted independantly of each other most of the time and
follow their own individual sets of morals, but who do work towards a
common goal and share information and support when possible, without a
strict set of rules might be a good example of a clan a chaotic good
player would join, as would a clan dedicated simply to 'acquiring and
protecting knowledge'.

@cChaotic Neutral@n - These people tend to follow whatever whim strikes
them at the moment.  There is no order or reason to their actions, as
laws and rules mean nothing to them -- many change their mind on a whim.
Good and evil do not affect their decisions.  If they cant decide on 
a course of action, they might flip a coin -- heads, give the child a 
toy; tails, burn the child's house down for sport. Chaotic neutrals 
almost never join a clan, as they don't commit to any cause for more 
than a few days before becoming bored.

@cChaotic Evil@n - Chaotic evil characters see nothing wrong with taking
whatever they want how ever they can.  Laws and rules are for the weak. 
The strong have the right to take what they want.  Bloodthirsty bandits
or a rampaging monster would be chaotic evil. Chaotic evils might form
temporary groups (perhaps to destroy and loot a small town), but would 
never join a long term clan.~

0 0 22 Alignment2~
.@cGood:@n
@ICreatures of a good alignment work to maximize the good of society
as a whole, benevolently putting the interests of others above, or equal
to, their own.

@cNeutral:@n
@IThose of a neutral alignment are not overly concerned with the
interests of others, preferring to work toward their own goals.  However,
harming others in the process is not acceptable to them.

@cEvil:@n
@IConcerned solely with themselves, evil beings will do whatever is
necessary to acheive their goals, regardless of the harm done to those who
get in their way.


@IThe following categories are personal beliefs.  They reflect how you
live your life within your alignment and society.  There is no right or
wrong, only the way your character feels is the best way to acheive the
goals they desire.

@cLawful:@n
@ILawful characters follow the laws of their society and try to uphold
them.  Order and organization are his two favorite things.

0 0 22 Alignment_change~
.So, you want an alignment change.  Well..... NO!!!

All kidding aside, the truth of the matter is you probably aren't going
to get one.  I'll lay down the basics for you so you'll understand where
matters lie.

@CRule #1@n: NO ONE gets to change alignment between Good - Neutral - Evil.
This may have happened in the past, but it is unequivocally not going to
happen now.  Policy stands.
That means no good to neutral, no neutral to good.  No neutral to evil,
and no evil to neutral, and absolutely no good to evil or vice-versa.
Let me clarify good, neutral and evil.  They are the 3 base alignments.

Good = lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good.
Neutral = lawful neutral, pure neutral, chaotic neutral.
Evil = lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil.

In other words... Neutral Good means you are of "good" alignment, NOT "neutral".
In any alignment where neutral is the first word, it means neutrality of
law and chaos, not neutrality of good and evil alignment.

Ok, hopefully we have that little bit of confusion straightened out.  The
last part seems to confuse so many people, and a thorough understanding
of it can save both your and our lives a great deal of mental sparring
over a pointless debate.

@CRule #2@n: You can not change from lawful to chaotic or chaotic to lawful.
Pretty straightforward I think.

@CRule #3@n: Even if you manage the nearly impossible feat of earning an
alignment change once, it will NOT happen again.  For example, if you
start as chaotic good, the best you can ever hope for is neutral good. 
In truth, you probably won't even get that.


Its not that we don't think people can change, we even used to do them
occassionally, but the problem is almost all the time it is for reasons
that are not realistic (realistic being used with some artisic license,
as it means real within the little fantasy realm we have created here). 
In the end, it wasn't worth altering 100 people because 1 person in the
group had a good reason and bothered to follow role playing restrictions
anyhow.  Most people who want one haven't bothered role playing their
alignment in the first place.  The only reason they're asking is to join
a clan or use equipment they can't currently.

So, how can you get one of these rare alterations of your personna?
My suggestions are as follows...

First, ask an imm if they'll even consider doing it.
(After all the hassle, and policy stating we wont we still have the same
100 people trying to argue to change because "they're reason should be
allowed, even though they understand why no one else's should.") 
If they say no, don't argue about it.  This is about the only time asking
another imm might work.  Asking an imm after one has told you no we won't
allow you only gets you in trouble because we post such things.  If they
said no because they are tired of the whining (and most of it is whining)
then they'll probably just say no and hope you leave them alone.  Arguing
will only make them mad and work against you.

Second, be prepared to make a commitment.
I tell them to role play their current alignment for about a month.
post notes showing that they are playing that alignment, at least 1
well-written, well-role-played note on stories a week.
Then, over the next month role play the gradual change of character and
post notes on how that's going too.  At the end, if you've impressed me
suitably that you are, in fact, role playing and have some concept about
what the alignment you are and are changing to entails, I'll probably
change you.

A little side-note about the posted notes.  A well-written note may be
short, but more often then not you aren't going to be able to write out
all you need to place (atmosphere, setting, drama, what have you) in a
single paragraph.  Such a note should be posted on stories board, as this
is the story of your character's current life.

(The only exception to these rules may be characters under level 3 who
are just learning mudding and role playing for the first time.  After
that, all rules stand.  If it really means that much to your character,
its more often a better show of devotion to just delete and start over as
a sign of your true change of heart as well as comitment to the change. 
Otherwise, it probably wasn't that important to you.  The last stands for
a level 80 as much as it does for a level 10 character.) ~

.@CSYNTAX@n

@Gappearance@n <text> : sets your appearance

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Characters that you have never met before are described by their physical
appearance.  Only after a player introduces himself or herself to you
will you see that player's name.  This appearance is set by the player. 
The commands to do so are @Bappearance@n and @Bkeywords@n.

Appearances do NOT start with "a" or "an." The game puts this in
for you. You do not need a "." at the end either.
Appearances must be less than 50 characters in length.

Your appearance should show those physical characteristics that another
person would first notice when looking at you.  It should not show
emotion or how someone might react to your appearance.  Avoid words that
would be assumed for your race already, i.e.  short, stocky dwarf or
tall, thin vyan.  Appearances should also not include actions such as
hiding (a thief skill) or things that assume how you are clothed.

@GDO NOT PUT YOUR CLASS IN YOUR APPEARANCE!@n
Your race SHOULD be included (disguises do not, as such, exist right now,
so appearances such as 'mysterious figure cloaked in darkest samite' are
not acceptable.) 
References to your race should not be capitalized.  And if you wish to
use a number in your appearance, please spell it out.

Your keywords should include every word from your appearance, including
race, separated by spaces, not commas.

Slang such as "buff, ripped, butch, cool, etc" is not acceptable and will
not be approved.

Lastly, you need to set a description.  This is done with the command
@Bdescription@n.  After you have set appearance, keywords and
description, type: @Brequest avatar approval@n or @Brequest immortal
approval@n for someone to approve you.
Sometimes, usually very late at night or early morning, there might not
be any avatars or immortals online.  In this case, you will have to wait
for one to log online.

It is mandatory that you be approved to advance to level 6.
There are a great many players these days, and it is a good idea to try
to come up with keywords, and a part of your appearance that are unique.

@yExamples of unacceptable appearances@n:
  Jedi Knight
  mysterious figure
  two-headed Chaos Troll, crackling with eldrich energy
  tall, dark, thin vyan

0 0 0 Arinosh's Hedge Maze~
.Years ago, an aspiring wizard named Arinosh, determined his goal in life
was to be a helping hand to the forces of nature...to create and change
the way nature functioned without disruption of the balance that nature
brought.  To this end, he sought the council of the elves, those beings
most closely tied to the very earth itself.  His character spoke true and
so the mage dwelt among the elves for some years, learning from them and
watching their peaceful coexistence with land.  Alas, Arinosh left the
elves, and traveled out into the wilds to carve out a home for himself. 
Scouring the countryside, he found a suitable spot and set to work
crafting a domain.

             ******************************************

Arinosh settled in the hills near the ogre town of Denab-Knur, where he
began creating a garden paradise.  Thieves and brigands raided the
location often at first, but then Arinosh developed some mysterious
manner of defense and the vagabonds withdrew to leave the hedge wizard to
his own devises.  Unfortunately, the peace was short-lived.  Recent
messages received by Prenslie of Chiiron and Krasnog of Medienne tell of
a desperate situation forming at the hedge garden.  Arinosh has detected
a sinister presence infiltrating his plant creations and has asked for
help from his fellow mages and their champions.

Causes a single attack to be done by char1 to char2.  If char1 is not
currently fighting char2, an attack will be initiated.  If char1 is
holding a weapon, damage will be determined by the weapon, but if they
are disarmed or not holding a weapon, the dam value will be used.  Make
sure you use dam values that are significantly lower than thier weapon so
that the disarm skill has use.  If you make it higher, the mob will
become tougher once disarmed and that is unreasonable.

@Gauction@n <item> <min_bid> : places an item on the @Gauction@n block
@Gauction@n undo [slot]      : removes an item placed on the auction block

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Auction places an item on the @Gauction@n block from anywhere throughout
the land.  When an item is placed on the block, a timer is started. 
Players may bid on an item using the bid command.  To place a bid you
must have sufficent funds in your bank account.  At the end of the time
whoever has placed the highest bid receives the item.  If no one has bid
on the item it is returned to the seller.  If either seller or buyer has
quit the game the transaction still occurs with the player file being
modified as appropriate.  Gold is only transfered between bank accounts
so if an item is sold the seller's bank account will be credited with the
bid price and the buyer's debited.  The @Gauction undo@n command removes
an item from the block assuming it is issued shortly after the item is
auctioned.

The auction gremlin charges a small fee for his services.

@CMore Information@n:

You may set how much information you receive over the info channel about
auction with iflag auction.  Level 1 means you only receive a message
when an item is placed on the block.  Level 2 adds messages for the
selling of items.  Level 3 is all messages including bids on items.

The abbreviations listed under condition are described below:

wls = worthless
dmg = damaged
vwn = very worn
wrn = worn
vsc = very scratch
scr = scratched

backstab <target>

@CDESCRIPTION@n

   A skill associated with thieves and thugs.  With their skills at

weapon, stab it into very damaging parts of the body.  You don't actually
have to try and sneak and hide to use the skill, but be aware it takes
you a few moments to recover from the attack.  

Damage depends on several factors - these include: level, dex, if victim
can see you, and how noisy your armor is.  You have a very good chance to
hit a sleeping or unconcious victim, but an alert victim who can see you
is impossible to successfully backstab.~

0 0 10 Beard Rings~
.@CDwarven beard rings and their signifigance@n
  
The diminutive race of peoples know collectively as the race of dwarves
share several common traits that mark their race as a whole.  Among these
traits are their shorter stature than that of most other races, a hearty
endurance, generally a strong work ethic, and the ever-present beard
found on both sexes.  While some races generally find facial hair to be
repugnant, the dwarves all take their beards quite seriously.  To the
dwarven peoples the loss of a beard to mishap is nearly viewed as being
more heinous to the individual than even the loss of a limb.  The dwarf
who chooses to shave off his beard risks becoming an outcast among his or
her own people who will wonder what is fundamentally wrong with the
individual.
 
Needless to say, that among such strong feelings about their beards,
beard fashion would tend to become a subject of interest.  An early
forerunner in the beard fashion parade was, and remains the twin braids. 
Among other schools of thought single braids, multiple braids, unbraided,
and countless cuts and styles are also popular.  One underlying precept
that took hold early on, and continues to be a highly esteemed practice
among the dwarven peoples is the fashion of the beard ring.  Having taken
a strong hold as a consistent fashion statement, the upper eschelon of
dwarves managed to orchestrate the whims of fashion to serve a practical
purpose.  Over centuries fashion became custom and the plain unmarked
rings have become symbols of ones status within dwarven society.
   
Though the dwarves talk little of it to outsiders, considering it
something of personal matter, outsiders have learned the following things. 
There are seven metal types used to mark the various levels of
achievement: bronze, copper, silver, gold, platinum, steel, and mithril. 
Young dwarves are not permitted to wear the rings at all until they have
proven themselves by act and deed.  Once proven experienced enough to be
a member of society, the dwarven individual is permitted to wear the
bronze rings.  As individuals earn honor and achievement they are
permitted to purchase rings that mark the gaining of prestige among their
kindred.  Most dwarves eagerly await the day when they can purchase their
first set of rings and strives to improve their standing every day of
their life.  Only a select few have ever been accorded the honor to wear
the mithril rings, and there is even a dwarven legend of one great
dwarven warrior who so embodied the dwarven ethic and achievement that he
was accorded a set of liridium beard rings.~

16 0 19 Beech Forest~
.Stories go that at one time a young apprentice sorceress betrayed her
master and fled with one of his powerful spell books.  She traveled the
land, in constant fear of him coming to seek revenge.  After many years
of the roaming life, the apprentice at last made her way to an isolated
forest in the gentle northern mountains.  Nearby villagers used to go to
the young woman for advice, for although young, she had learned much from
the mystic book, and the simple rural people were impressed with her
parlor magics.  Several years passed of this humble life and the
sorceress became increasingly bold in her claims of power, often
remarking on her notable heritage.

That winter strange sights were seen around the village, large rats began
to infest the grain stores and food and clothing started to go missing. 
The villagers began to think they were haunted and sent some of their
warriors to seek help.  It would be these few that would live.  As winter
came to an end, sightings of rats became more and more frequent.  Some
swore that these rats wore clothes and stood upright, but glimpses were
fleeting and easily dismissed as imagined.  Then on the first day of
spring, a terrible storm blew up and crowded around the village.  A voice
boomed from out of the darkened clouds, "Fools, you have sheltered my
apprentice and now you shall feel my displeasure".  The master extracted
a terrible revenge; fire and lightning rained from the sky, reducing the
village to ruins and killing all of the villagers.  Then, as if in shame,
he commanded the forest to bury the destruction in a blanket of thorns. 
Even these were tainted with vengeful magics, twisting into dark
blood-red thorn bushes.  Once buried, the master constructed guardians to
keep prying eyes from the area.  What fate befell his apprentice is
unknown, although undoubtedly it was as terrible a deed as that suffered
by the villagers.

Several years later, travelers to the forest reported strange sights; men
made of sticks walking in the woods, and of a stone statue that weeps
blood.  Visitors are often advised to avoid these woods, for fear of
incurring the wrath of the sorcerer's curse.~

.@GWelcome to Legacy's Dawning.@n This is a quick-start file designed to
help you get going as fast as possible.

You will start in one of two main towns.  If you are a member of the evil
races (orcs, gobins, ogres, trolls, or vyans) you will begin in the evil
town of @GVoaleth@n.  All other race types start in the good town of
@GChiiron@n.  It is probably in your best interests to stay close to town
until you get a feel for the mud.  You may get a map of your settlement
by typing 'help Voaleth' or 'help Chiiron' respectively.  It is a good
idea to wander about town and learn your way around.  Go into shops and
type 'list' to see what each sells, 'custom' to see if the shop offers to
make any custom-made items, and 'practice' to see what skills you may
practice in a location.  It is not wise to kill shopkeepers, start with
rabbits and frogs outside of Chiiron or screech bats and homonculus in
the caves east of Voaleth and work your way up from there.  There is a
being in each starting town who will answer many questions posed to it. 
In Chiiron it is the weary elf, in Voaleth the aged troll - a good way to
start is by going up to it and typing @G'ask elf advice'@n or @G'ask
troll advice'@n as the case may be.  Conversations with most NPCs can
also be initiated with by typing @G'to <mobname> hi'@n.  To get @Chelp@n
on a topic, type help <keyword>.  You might also want to try out the
@Cindex@n, which you can begin using by simply typing @Cindex@n and
following the instructions.

For starting XP in Chiiron, try killing the frogs north of town or the
rabbits outside the west and east gates near town.  If you are starting
in Voaleth seek out the tunnel worms east of town or the screech bats
north and east of town.  Remember to use the @Cconsider@n command before
you attack a mob - this can tell you, very roughly, how tough a mob is to
fight.

Some mobs, such as rabbits and screech bats, may be skinned.  You may
then sell their skins to raise money.  (See help @Cskin@n).

Important commands which you should learn to check frequently are
@Cscore@n, @Cinventory@n, @Cleech@n, @Cidentity@n,  and@C reputation@n.

To learn how @Ccustom@n items work, check out help custom.

For information on skills, type help @Cabilities@n.

Other useful files which you might wish to read include help @Cnewbie@n
and help @Cstarting@n.  If you are a member of class that casts spells,
read help @Cleech@n and help @Cprepare@n.

Before you reach level 5, you will need to get your character
@Capproved.@n See help @Capprovals@n and follow the directions therein
when you get the opportunity.

The global/public channels here are @Cchat@n, @Cgossip@n, @Cooc@n
(out-of-character), and @Cauction@n.  Immortals generally only listen to
gossip.  If you have a question, feel free to ask for help on chat - the

bite <victim> : You bite your <victim>.

@GDESCRIPTION@n
Lizardmen and goblins, being two races who have extremely small but sharp
teeth are able to bite their opponents.  Though the attack does little
damage, being similar to a punch or a kick, it nonetheless is enough to
enrage their victims into combat.~

.~

0 0 1 Bite of the Fire Ant~
.The bite of a fire ant seems to send fire cruising though the unlucky
victim's veins.  Using this spell a druid is able to call a small colony
of fire ants to attack his victim though they are rather unruly and so
are unabled to controlled for long.  As soon as the druid loses control
the colony scatters, returning home.

0 0 17 BlackJack~
.Sometimes a creature is too powerful for a thief to handle without
companions to aid him, yet sometimes they need to get past a individual
blocking them from their goals.  Knocking a person unconcious is not an
easy task, yet some thieves have acquired the knack for it.

0 0 15 Blade Dancer~
.The warrior mystics of Khephera have walked the earth in their quest for
mastery over song, dance and combat for many years.  However, only since
the discovery of the new continent have their teachings been made
available to those who wish to dedicate them selves to the way of
neutrality and the arts of Khephera.  Neophytes of the order learn the
way of flowing warfare, enabling them to strike and fade with skills
greater than any other warrior.  The power of Khephera allows them to
channel song and dance into mystical forms, transforming a mundane skill
into a divine art.  The way of the blade dancer is an exacting path, one
that requires great nimbleness and intuition coupled with a sharp whit
and hardy disposition.

Because of the need for free movement, Blade dancers are unable to wear
leather or heavier armor.  Blades perform their skills with the @CDance@n
and @CSing@n commands.

0 0 1 Bless~
.This cleric spell, learned very early in one's career, invokes the
blessing of the cleric's deities upon the target of the spell, whether
that target be the cleric himself or some other ally of the cleric.  The
blessing, while in effect, will increase the chance that one has to hit
one's enemies while in physical combat.~

.~

0 0 1 Blessed Aura~
.A cleric can call upon his god to protect him with an aura that will deal
damage to opponents of an evil nature.
~

.~

0 0 1 Blessed Fruit~
.When cast upon upon a piece of common fruit this spell endows the fruit
with magical energy that can heal some wounds.  A piece of fruit blessed
like this will often glow with magical energy.
~

.~

0 0 1 Blessing of Taraskatt~
.Rains down chunks of rotting, maggot-infested flesh and bone upon an
area, spreading a demonic plague to all within its reach.  A dark spell
even for a sorcerer, often those infected wish for a much quicker death
than the rot gives them.
~

.Effect -- Rain spell that does 300D+(10d8*L) damage to all mobs in room.
Reagent -- Seal of Taraskatt
Resist -- Disease
~

0 0 1 Blight~
.Calling upon the demons of disease, the sorcerer belabors a target with a
fast acting disease that rots their flesh and turns their bones to dust.
Under the hideous effect of the infliction, the victim staggers as if
weighed down by a heavy burden 
~

.Effect -- disease damage 3 rounds of 2d6+(L*3) and 10+(L*3) move debuff
Reagents -- Spirit stone of Disease
Resist -- disease
cast_mess $N skin begins to turn a sickly grey
cast_end $N skin returns to a healthy shade.
~

0 0 1 Blind~
.This immensely useful spell will magically blind the unfortunate victim,
thus reducing the victim's combat effectiveness.  Time, if the victim of
the blindness spell has enough, will cure the blindness, or a cleric who
has the knowledge can cure the magical affliction.~

.~

0 0 17 Blind Fighting~
.This skill allows monks to sense their opponent using more than just
their sense of sight.  The result of this is that they are able to hit
their opponents more accurately and with more power.  This skill is
automatic, and is so ingrained in the monks repertoire they are not aware
of it in action.~

.~

0 0 1 Blinding Light~
.This spell produces a very brief, but very intense, flash of light. 
Anyone in the room (save the caster) may be affected by this spell.~

.~

0 0 1 Blink~
.A powerful spell said to be the creation of a group of Vyan magi who
dabbled in arts best left untouched.  This spell, however, was one of
their more successful creations and did not bring about their ultimate
(and quite painful) demise.  When cast, Blink "teleports" the caster away
from his present position to a nearby locale.  The proficiency of the
caster determines the distance of the transfer, with the most powerful of
magi able to use this spell to move several areas away from an enemy or
potential harm.~

.~

0 0 1 Blood Bond~
.After years of study, a sorcerer becomes attuned to their body and mind,
enabling them to convert useless health into valuable mana.  This blood
bond enables the caster to harness their blood and transform it over time
into faster regeneration for their mana.  It is possible for a careless
sorcerer to slay themeselves by over use of the life tap.  On rare
occasions, others of similar alignment can share in the feast of blood,
consenting to the quickening decay of flesh for the race of raw magics.
~

.Effects -- Reduces hp regen and inflicts 30damage to target, increass
their mana regen and gives them 60 mana 
Reagent -- nill
Resist -- Nill (willing target)
~

0 0 1 Blood Fiend~
.Summons a blazing fiend of blood and fire to serve the sorcerer.  The
powerful creature is the strongest that can walk upon the earth in
servitude.  Called from the demonic planes, the fiend attacks its foes
from a distance, preferring fire and arcane means to dispatch an enemy. 
Under its haze of smoldering flame and pitch smoke, the creature twists
and shifts in pure chaotic form.  Calling such a powerful ally requires
more in the way of blood sacrifices from both the sorcerer and an
unwilling victim.
~

.Effect -- Summons a lvl 55 demon mage pet - summon the spell inflicts
Reagent -- Book of dark summons, arch demon gall stone(consumed), heart
of a priest(consumed) 
Resist -- Nill but spell can fail
~

0 0 1 Body Rot~
.Upon being cast at target, the victim becomes target of an evil spell,
removing flesh from their body.  Immense pain is caused from this
incantation, and also has a side effect of disarming weapon/shield.
~

.~

0 0 1 Body Snatch~
.This is the improved 'Deaths Recall'.  This allows a sorcerer to have
even greater range.  The sorcerer is not longer trapped with a small
zone, but allows access through out the continent.
~

.~

0 0 1 Bone Dart~
.Using a sliver of a victim's bone, the sorcerer transforms the shard into
a bolt of energy that strikes at a target with unerring accuracy. 
Although a basic offensive spell, it can be a useful first strike at an
unsuspecting foe, the impaling dart causing a fair amount of shock and
damage.
~

.Effect -- 3d8+(L*2) physical damage
Reagent -- shard of bone
Resist -- Physical
~

0 0 1 Bone Prison~
.The next generation of binding and sumong for the sorcerer.  This spell
like its lesser 'Ghost Chain', binds a subject.  This necromantic spell
summons for a prison of bone.  It encages an unfortunate victim.  While
the victim is still able to move, it reach is limited while that cage
stands between the sorcerer and itself.
~

.~

0 0 1 Bone Wrench~
.An upgrade to skin wrench, this more powerful spell attacks the bones and
structure of a creature, enabling the dark magic to inflict its damage on
a greater range of victims.  Unlike skin wrench, a target need only have
physical form to take damage from the twisting and tearing.
~

.Effect -- DD damage and will effect any creature that has a physcal form
Reagent -- shard of bone
Resist Physical
cast_mess $N shudders as their bones begin to split and crack!
~

16 0 17 Bow~
.This is a weapon skill that specializes in the use of 'ranged' weapons. 
This skill does not apply to crossbows, which has a separate skill.

0 0 1 Bramble Skin~
.The first of a druid's summer shield spells coats a target in a shield of
stinging brambles.  Unfortunate victims who try and strike the protected
character find themselves cut with the sharp thorns.

.Bugbears, a tall humanoid race of carnivors are known to dwell in the
caves that riddle the ground between Chiiron and Kha-Da.  In past times
they would sweep out of the caves and raid the village of Chiiron,
carrying off the unwary to be placed in the soup-pots.  A hardy band of
adventurers claims to have solved the problem, stating that with some
luck the bugbears will soon die of starvation, unable to escape the
predicament the adventurers left them in.  Should you come across a
bugbear, be extremely cautious as they will be hungry and have no
compunctions about eating you.~

to destroy anything within their path.~

16 0 19 Butterfly Garden~
.At a young age, Randaran Alevain was struck with wanderlust and he left
the elven forest to see the world.  He spent many years traveling, and
eventually returned to the forest.  Upon his return, he met a fair elfess
named Alenda, and they were wed.  Alenda would listen for hours to
Randaran's tales of the wide world, and when he told her of his desire to
travel again, she was only too willing to accompany him.  They spent some
time traveling, and then the day came when they decided it was time to
settle down.  The Alevains bought a plot of land near Ceanshire, and
built themselves a small house.  Their first child was soon born, and
another followed not long after.

As time passed, the elder Alevains began to miss some of the elven fauna,
namely the gloriously coloured butterflies native to their homeland. 
Randaran decided that he would travel back to catch some, and bring them
back to share with his family and any other who would care to see them. 
A maze of hedge was built, to provide amusement for visitors as well as a
habitat for the insects.  So the Butterfly Gardens were conceived, and
the Alevain family has been caring for these delicate creatures ever
since.~

16 0 19 Byron's Workshop~
.In ancient days when the Dwarven Empire was at the strongest, Byron, the
mastersmith, used to make beautiful magical, mechanical toy animals for
the Dwarven people.  As he grew in skill, he became more of a recluse,
until he was rarely seen outside of his mountain workshop.  Reports of
maniacal laughter and odd lights came from his mountain caverns. 
Eventually, he announced to the Dwarven council that he had finally found
a way to replace messy life of all animals and races with bright shiny
mechanical life.  He had even found a way to make Dwarven golems.

Needless to say, the council was horrified and had Byron sealed within
his workshop home in fear.  History has since forgotten where this
strange workshop is, but recently, that home has been uncovered and
explorers are starting to venture within.

attacking.  Some monsters, though, will realize that the caster is
attempting to trick them into relaxing, and refuse to succumb to the
charm.~

with their surroundings.  No mere mortals are able see those who are
camouflaged, though some magical creatures of great experience are able
to detect someone even when they are so well hidden.~

.@CSYNTAX@n:

Camp - Sets up the camp
Camp break - Breaks down the camp

This skill allows a ranger to prepare a camp site for resting.  The
warmth of a fire and the protective aura the ranger creates allows
everyone in the room to heal faster than normal.  The affect of this
skill disappears when you cancel it with 'camp break'.

.@CSYNTAX@n

int can_buy_pet( pet, player);

pet - pointer to the mob to test as a pet (usually the mob variable)
player - player who is checked to see if he can buy the pet (usually ch)

@CDESCRIPTION@n

returns true/false if a player is allowed to have the pet if it was to be
sold to him (useful for selling a pet to a player in return for a service
other than money).

EXAMPLES

mob = mload 2477, room );
if( can_buy_pet( mob, ch ) ) {
add_pet( mob, ch );
}
else junk_mob( mob );

PARAMETERS:

works on mobs).

RETURNS:

True or false dependant on whether the mob can or not.~

16 0 2 can_tame_pet~
.@CSYNTAX@n

int can_tame_pet( pet, player );

PARAMETERS:

pet - pointer to the mob to test as a pet (usually the mob variable)
player - player who is checked to see if he can tame the mob (usually ch)

@CDESCRIPTION@n

returns true/false if a player is allowed to have the pet if it was to be
tamed by him (useful for junking an old pet then replacing it with a new
one of a higher level but making sure they can have the higher level one)
This is done using the same calls made by the spell when a player casts
it (with obviously the same results).

EXAMPLES

mob = mload( 2477, room );
if( can_tame_pet( mob, ch ) )
add_pet( mob, ch );

NOTE

This can be used to make great pets which grow with time.  Although this
requires some work to make a few mobs that the original 'grows' through,
it should be well worth the effort.  See the warg puppy (vnum 2476) as an
example.

16 0 19 Ceanshire~
.@RCeanshire@n | vnum 200-299
Creator:  Tiene
Location:  East and some south of Dun T

A small pastoral hamlet, Ceanshire was settled originally by halflings,
although it is now also a home to farmers of the human and elvish races. 
The primary crops of the area will be hay, grains such as wheat, barley
and hops, and many homes will also have small herb gardens.  The town
will also be reknown for a local horsebreeder who lives nearby.  Shops in
the hamlet include: apothocary, blacksmith, harnessmaker,
horsebreeder/stables, and a brewery of ales and small beer.
                       @g-----------------@n
@Y===@n Once vehicle code is in, I'd like to make it look as if there is
cart traffic between Ceanshire and another town, detailing an economic
relationship with a town that breeds cattle.  The hay from Ceanshire can
be traded for leathers from that other town, leathers that are then used
at the harnessmaker's and in the outfitting of the stables.
@Y===@n Architectural style: Thatched, rounded roofs atop
brightly-painted wooden planks.  Most homes have wandering little
pathways leading up to them, and nearly every house has at least one herb
garden filled with common cooking spices.  The paint colours of the
houses are typical flower colors: yellow, red, lavender, and all shades
of blue.  The houses themselves are 4-square, but the outbuildings are
generally round as they are tiered silos.

0 0 1 Chain lightning~
.An even more advanced spell than @Clightning bolt@n, chain lightning
harnesses a greater amount of electrical energy to a more hazardous, and
even less predictable, effect.  When discharged, chain lightning looses
itself upon an area, and may strike or bounce off of all opponents in the
area, including the same target multiple times.  Needless to say, a
weapon harnessed with care and by only the most powerful of wizards.

16 0 19 Chamber of Nordun~
.@ILong ago it is rumored that there was a kingdom in the north named
Ridania, its history a long and prosperous one.  Friends of the dwarves
that lived nearby in the mountains and powerful allies of the White Oak
Monastery, the land flourished under the strong blood of human kings. 
The ancient kings ruled for many generations until one day a powerful
sorceror named Norzan the Black arrived at the kingdom.  Disguised in the
robes of a cleric, he offered his services to the king of the day, named
Nordun.  The King refused, for he already had a cleric at his side. 
Norzan, whose plan it was to use his black arts to destroy the kingdom,
put a curse upon the King and his followers.  The King's own personal
magician, Varconel, challenged Nordun, but was feebly defeated.  However,
Varconel was able to capture that which Norzan had valued most, a
beautiful shimmering orb which greatly empowered him.  Norzan fled the
kingdom, pursued by other powerful, close kin of Nordun.  But before he
had left, he summoned ancient, dark magics and buried the land in a great
earthquake.  King Nordun himself had been changed into an evil dragon,
and many of his closest advisors were trapped within the earth with the
cursed king.  While his advisors were able to avoid the dragon, who was
buried deep in his bedchambers, they slowly died from lack of food and
water.  Some say the whistling wind on the northern mountain roads
sometimes carry the sound of their wailing voices, still buried under the
rock.~

0 0 7 Chandros~
.@BChandros@n - God of Justice, chivalry, and courage in battle.

Chandros, the Radiant One, is the god of natural law and justice.  He is
known among all the gods foremost as the most chivalrous, honourable, and
fair.  Some see his sense of honour and fairness as his greatest
weakness, but his followers harness it as their greatest strength.  They
believe that only through honour and justice does one lead a worthy life. 
The laws that he governs are those that are deemed to exist as universal
truths: the right to exist, for example, or the right to choose your own
path in life and are not to be confused with mortal conceptions of law. 
It is the enemies of fairness and natural law that Chandros and his
allies in the pantheon strive to defeat.

Some primitive peoples believe that Chandros is the sun, and worship him
as such, having daily rituals to ensure his return in the morning.  Other
cultures of darker nature loathe the light that Chandros provides,
preferring the blackness of night and the warmth of a full moon.  These
same cultures also tend to use the night as a staging time from which
they wreak havoc on the races that thrive in the daylight.  Especially
among them are the followers of the Ebon Triumvirate, but all dark gods
hold him as a foe.

The followers of Chandros are held with a great deal of respect
throughout the realm, often known as being his pure hearted servants. 
Their almost fanatical sense of honour and justice is seen as a great
asset to the followers of light.  All those who follow his ways travel
the paths of law and good to protect the innocent and fight with virtue,
the epitome of chivalry and a shining example to all.  When Chandros
appears to his followers in an omen, it is most often as a young human
male with brilliant blue eyes and shining golden hair, bedecked in a suit
of polished plate armour and carrying a large bastard sword, its blade
wreathed in white flame.  He always bears a large kite shield, emblazoned
with a bastard sword, point down, against a backdrop of a rising sun, and
this shield is used worldwide as his symbol.~

.Like all centers of wealth and prosperity, Chiiron has attracted its
share of those that would prey upon those who have wealth and happiness. 
Bandits have taken refuge in the hills to the south of Chiiron.  The
reports of their numbers and strength vary, and the Guardsmen and Mages
are unable to devote time to tracking them down.~

the form of giant creatures and legions of undead.~

palm upright, and using a few words of power forces the air between the

The victim can suffer intense pain and damage from the chilling touch if

.Near the war-ravaged city of Medienne, deep in the heart of its darkest

while up close it is evident that a mighty thunderstorm rages atop the
dark granite walls of the citadel.  A great dark shape can sometimes be
seen in the sky, but if that is fact or rumor no one knows for certain. 
A small force of dark knights, clerics, and wizards guard the secrets of
the citadel.  Not many lost adventurers who find themselves within the
citadel return to see the light of day.  It is said that the guardians of
the citadel possess the power of its chief evil, as if it possesses each
of them.~

The option 'g' means it works on a guild.  Eg clans -fg <acronym> to form
a guild, or clans -og <option> to toggle guild options.

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

To start a clan you must recruit people to swear allegiance to you and
your cause.  @eYou must also be at least level 10.@n A starting fee of
20pp is required to begin a new clan.  Clans will require a charter that
states your clan's ideals or purpose, and at least five members to be
approved and receive the benefits of a codified institution.  A clan may
choose its members according to its charter within a few simple
guidelines.

@I@b*@nClans may have good members or evil members, but not both.
Good/neutral and evil/neutral are allowed.  (In the instance of a heavily
role-played clan, this rule 'may' be overlooked.  A clan is only
considered a roleplay clan when they have provided logs of rp to the
immortal staff.  Roleplay isn't a convenience you can claim for the sake
of bypassing rules.) 
@I@b*@nCertain races may not be in a clan together. (For instance,
vyans and elves would not be in the same clan.)  In the instance of a clan
that takes its members from but a single alignment, racial barriers may be
crossed.
@I@b*@nThose who have chosen to follow a chaotic evil alignment may not
join a clan.  Chaotic evil characters are motivated solely by the desire
for personal gain and pleasure.  Since the interests of others are utterly
meaningless to them, they are unlikely to be attracted to the unity of
ideals found in a clan.

Clans will have the option of remaining unknown.  If you do not wish your
clan to be seen on the public clan list, you may toggle the option
Exist.Known.  If you want your charter publicly displayed without your
members showing, you may toggle the option Members.Known.

Once your options are set and your clan charter is in place, an immortal
will look it over and set your clan as approved.

Also, the minimum level for each clan must be level 10.  You may apply
for a lower level, but it is extremely unlikely it will be approved.

.@C@bIMMORTAL NOTES@n

The command to delete a clan is clans delete <clan_name>.~

0 0 21 Clans2~
.Plan A: Can be alignment based clan.  Either good or evil.  Good clans
seek to sort out the world and evil clans seek to reap as much profit as
possible.  Such a clan can accept any race.
Plan B: Cause based clan.  This takes more argument.  They can choose between good/neutral or neutral/evil but never good and evil in the same clan.

Restrictions
Good/Evil cannot be accepted in same clan.
If lawful is accepted you may not mix elves/dwarves/gnomes/lizards with
orcs/trolls/ogres/goblins 
Chaotic evil may not be in any clan.~

.Clerics are devotees to a god or religion, and their piety brings them much
reward.  Channeling the power of a deity through themselves, clerics have
the ability to perform miracles of the curative and protective type.  Other
powerful spells learned by these magic users do include harmful ones, as
they can bring down a god's holy wrath upon a foe with @Charm@n and @Cslay@n
spells.

With these spells alone, a cleric is a useful addition to a group, but with
the added spells of the creation type and the special @Cprotect life@n spell,
Clerics become a unique and powerful class required by all in any
successful endeavor.

Clerics may not use weapons which shed blood due to religious vows, but
nonetheless manage to have a wide selection of weapons and armor available
to them.

For a listing of the spells and abilities available to Clerics, please see

16 0 19 Clerical Training Grounds~
.A traveling bard and follower of Taraskatt recently was heard singing of
a mithril door located deep within the ancient stronghold now occupied by
the cult of Xharax.  While no bard may be fully trusted, most songs ring
with at least partial truth.  According to the song, the door is located
beneath a midnight black temple and guarded by twenty foot tall denizens
from the plains of hell itself.  Those wanting to gain access need not
fight these fearful guardians but must instead find a magical means of
access through an arcane language...  listeners to the song believe that
this language was contrived by the singer.  Once having gained access,
according to the bard, a world opens, or as he put it worlds, of
fantastical wonder including the plane of the dead, the plane of the
nether, a warriors dream of a world comprised entirely of sword blades
and an ancient land frozen in time...

No spokesman from the cult would confirm or deny the wild fantasies
evident within this song...  but a spokesman for the dwarven labor union
did state that @c'According to ancient blueprints that are too fragile to
bring out into the open, there was a black marble temple crafted inside the
ancient stronghold now occupied by Xharax, and that there was 'something'
built in complete secrecy beneath this place of worship.'@n He would
state no more and was vehemently angered when asked if the dwarven labor
union had required the help of powerful mages with the creation of the
compound in its entirity.~

.What follows are the <vnum>'s of a number of rooms, objects and mobs as
examples of how to write mud-programs.  They're all taken from what I've
done but please feel free to add any extra's - particulary as new code is
written by GC.  
    
 - Karn
  
#27002    - aedit 1, a gate opener, checks for clan.
          - aedit 2,3 entering and leaving room sends messages to
            another location.
#27003    - some simple levers and something to look at their current
            status.
#27005    - no action code, instead this was my first quest, check out
            qedit 5, and the objects in the room, use 'reset' to find
            what resets in the room. Note - that you can't see one of
            objects. (be carefull this can be a nightmare to edit)
            Oh, the quest is first given to a player by the mob
            Lampster - vnum 245
#27545    - This is one of my more complicated rooms. Basically the first
            two actions (stand inside, stand outside) set a 'condition'
            which the last program uses and the third action (leaving
            room) cleans up the status flags.
            The nasty program is the last one which basically either sends
            the player to a 'hell' if they've stuffed up the instructions
            or randomly gates in a Demon for the player -from which they
            need some reagents to complete the quest.
#218      - Complex use of reset0 and reset1.
#1667     - Example of loading a variety of objects into another item
            in a search code.

0 0 11 Conjuration and Summoning Spells~
.@CDESCRIPTION@n

These two categories of spells, conjuration and summoning, usually depend
upon casting a given spell over a particular reagent.  Lesser Summoning,
Find Familiar, Request Ally, Find Mount, Conjure Elemental, and Construct
Golem are such spells.  The degree to which you know the spell has a
direct determination on its rate of success.  Some reagents are more rare
than other, so pay heed and study the spell to your fullest capability
before casting one of these spells on an extremely rare reagent.~

.~

0 0 1 Conjure Elemental~
.Though mages deal with the intricacies of channeling the energy about
them into forces they can use, rangers are the only ones, being so close
to nature, that understand the elements enough to bring allies from the
elemental planes.  While only a seasoned ranger strong in the ways of
nature may call upon such an ally, their loyalty is oft more than a mere
animal might provide.  To conjure an elemental, a ranger must invoke the
spell over a reagent somehow linked to the elemental type they wish to
summon.

Rangers are limited by their alignment to what planes they may contact
for allies.  Rangers of neutrality may contact the elemental planes of
earth, air, fire and water while rangers of good conjure elementals from
the quasi-elemental planes.  The para-elemental planes are the only ones
open to evil rangers.

This compares you and the monster to see which would most likely win a
fight.  Use it to avoid hopeless battles.  Also, keep in mind there are
many many variables to combat here, such as special attacks, so this is a
very rough and frequently unreliable idea of an opponent's strength. 
Below is a list of the possible messages in logical order.

@CMESSAGES@n

An unworthy opponent.
Should be an easy kill.
You shouldn't have much difficulty.
It looks like a fair fight.
It will be a tough fight.
With luck on your side you might prevail.
You'll need a lot of help.
You don't have much of a hope.
You would require divine intervention
Attacking and suicide are equivalent.~

.By casting this spell over a prepared reagent that has been molded into
the basic shape of the golem type being sought after, a cleric is able to
infuse the molded spell component with enough energy so that it takes on
'life.' In addition, the spell forces the golem to grow in size
significantly from its sculpted, doll-like form.  Though incapable of
independant thought, the golems constructed by this spell follow the
orders of their cleric without question.  The golems known to be

Craft with no argument will return a list of what possible potions you
can create with your experience and skill level.  Some craftions will
require a skill level higher than 10, so you will need to find some items
to synergize your skill higher yet.

Craft's arguments must match exactly one of the names revealed by craft

user is often used as group cook and eventually develops the ability to
create more than one piece of food at a time.~

.~

0 0 1 Create Food~
.This spell magically creates an edible object.  The standing of the
caster will also determine the quality of the food produced.  Some say
the food is not necessarily created, but moved from somewhere in the
world to you.  The 'goody' clerics vehemently deny this, so perhaps it
depends on the patron deity.  ~

0 0 1 Create Light~
.This quick and simple spell is taught to all tyros pursuing the magical
arts, as it is a very useful spell for adventuring.  Originally it was
developed by a mage in the northern mountains several centuries ago as a
focus exercise for his young students.  As a reward for the correct
casting of the spell, they then had a light by which to study without
wasting the time meddling with a lamp or other mundane light source.

At each spell level there will be a random chance to create a light of a
higher level value.  For example, at level ten, you'll have a random
chance to create white lights, the optimum color.

.* ok, i don't know much about here, but the original plan was the OC was
to be 'destroyed' by an apocalyptic magic 
* the mages of the realms found another 'world' to go to avoid the
destruction, and created such a portal (this would be the nc/oc portal)
to transport them, and all those who were going 
* the 'new' gods are in reality just new names for the old ones, with
some new powers having been created during the apocalypse 
* in reality the nc wasn't a new world, but just a place very far away
* the world has space for 100 continents, which can be expanded
considerably with no trouble 
* the people coming from the oc found traces of civilization that would
have equaled their own in the oc, but no real traces of people, although
eventually new races were found (duergar, half-elf (when i get off my
ass) 
* the oc people created cities in places where there was considerable
foundation already existing, but the cities were far more forgiving than
the cities of old, the race-race hatred did not vanish, but other races
became tolerated 
* now the problem is, the nc was discovered without the apocalypse, so
alot of this information is invalid now, but i'm not sure if a story had
been created anywhere about it, and how it all came to be 
* of course, we could just switch it so that players who started on the
oc are descendents of those who remained behind, and those starting on
the nc are those descended of those who travelled to the new world

Continuing abuse of multi-play rules can lead to a temporary ban of up to
3 days and deletion of the highest ranking of the multi-players characters.

be dealt with in a somewhat more lenient manner 'if' they can prove they
were not using one character to aid the other.

* Bug exploitation *
First offense - warning
Second offense - imprisonment for a term of 1 to 3 days and loss of
experience or goods gained from bug exploitation.
Repeated offenses can lead to loss of experience and goods as well as

0 0 17 dance of the storm lord~
.With great leaps and tumbles the acolyte of Khephera draws down a
thunderous storm of elemental energy through their weapons.  With so much
force gathered the dancer often earths the elemental attack directly
through their target rather than needing to strike their foe.
~

.~

0 0 17 dance of the storm master~
.Spinning and weaving the dancer infuses themselves with the elemental
energy of the storm.  Under the effects of the elemental maelstrom the
dancer can strike with both elemental and physical damage.

0 0 0 Dance of the whirling swords~
.A fight can turn into a melee within seconds.  Often the centre of such
skirmishes the blade can take advantage of the chaos, whirling to land
blows on multiple opponents.

.Calling upon the protection of plants the dancer encases themselves in a
shield of sharp thorns that tear at the flesh of attackers.

are blistered by the cold.
~

0 0 17 dance of winter~
.Summoning a blanket of winters chill the blade dancer cloaks them in a
bitterly cold shield that bites at those who hit them.  Under the mantle
of winter a blade dancer is somewhat less resistant to fire attacks.

0 0 1 Dancing Tallow~
.A minor offensive spell, the druid uses the flickering flame of a candle
to scorch an enermy with a magic whip like tendril of fire.
~

0 0 1 Dark Chill~
.Releasing waves of cold, the sorcerer attempts to destroy a foe with a
chilling strike.  The first spell in a sorcerer's damage field, it serves
to strike down lesser creatures who dare disturb their dark musings. 
The unpredictable energies from beyond the grave require a reasonable
amount of control; a crystal wand acts as a focus for this spell.

to cast 
Reagents -- Crystal wand -- Newbie sorcerer quest 4 glass shards and sea

16 0 19 Darken Woods~
.@C@bDESCRIPTION@n
Long ago, in times so far distant that history itself holds little memory
of it, the area now known as Darken Wood was home to a small village and
a quiet people.  For as long as anyone can remember, however, the valley
south of the haunted wizard's tower near Kha-da has been the festering,
warped reflection of a healthy forest.  There are rumors the forest is
also home to great treasures, but few have survived exploration and
returned to confirm the tales.~

0 0 1 Dead Man Eyes~
.The dead often have many useful components lying about them, and none are
so useful as their eyes.  Using their necromatic magic, a sorcerer can
embue an eye to act as a light source for them.  The sickly light cast
from the dead eye is tinted blood red from the evil enchantment.  As the
spell slowly consumes the soul of the eye's previous owner, the light
lasts almost indefinitely.
~

.Effect -- continual light
Reagent -- Bloody human eye
Resist -- Nill
~

16 0 17 deadly strike~
.After many years of practice a blade dancer can land a crippling blow
that slices into the vitals of their foe.
~

.~

0 0 20 Death~
.When you are overcome in battle and you die, your soul is taken to the
paths of death.  Death, in his infinite wisdom, will grant you another
chance to achieve your life's goals at the small price of 1/4 of your
life's experience.  However, when you are returned to the realms, you are
weak, and disoriented.  This does pass after a short time, and you will
soon be at your maximum capacity once more.  Your corpse remains behind in
the location of your death, along with any items dying might have claimed.~

.~

0 0 1 Death Mask~
.Using shadow magic, the sorcerer cloaks himself in a veil of death, the
undead (for the most part) will not bother an individual affected by this. 
While it remains in effect, a sorcerer can pass undetected by any undead. 
Aggressive actions or spells destroy the cloak instantly, and once
detected by the undead, a sorcerer cannot recloak themselves.
~

.Effect -- Invis to undead
Reagent -- gem of the shadows
Resist -- Nill
cast_mess You cloak yourself from the dead.
~

0 0 1 Death Skin~
.Transforms the target's skin into that of the dead...tough, ugly and
resistant to all manner of damage.  Because of the stiffening of limbs, a
targets combat effectiveness and ability to move is somewhat effected. 
Under the mantle of the dead, it is also wise not to attempt to enter
good-aligned towns that generally take exception to the walking dead
seeking goods and services.
~

.Effects -- +6 Gobal AC -50move(reduced by 2 move)+(L*2) Makes race of
target UNDEAD for the duration of the spell 
Reagent -- Book of lies, strip of ghoul flesh(consumed)
Resist -- Nill (willing target)
cast_mess Transforms into a living dead.
cast_end life returns to $n

0 0 17 Death strike~
.@CDESCRIPTION@n

With this special attack the monk uses an ancient technique that allows
the monk to tap directly into into the shadow world and channel that
energy into their attacks causing massive damage.  This technique is
extremely dangerous and only taught to the most highly skilled of monks.~

.~

0 0 1 Deaths Recall~
.Death is no mans friend, but he still may come.  This spell was developed
to retrieve their corpse and what ever valuables left with in it.  This
simplic version, of what it may come, allows a sorcerer to retrive the
body any willing to consent to his will to him.  His range on this spell
is very small.
~

.~

0 0 1 Decaying Touch~
.Inflicts an item with a spirit of disease, causing each hit with the
weapon to blight the skin and blood of its victim.  While housing the
spirit, the item decays more quickly.  Often, after repeated castings, a
weapon may break.
~

.Effect -- adds +d6 disease damage to weapon, also reduces the durablity
by 100-(L*5) 
Reagent -- Spirit stone of Illness
Resist -- Disease (or poison maybe)
~

0 0 19 Decrepit House~
.Strange tales of frog like creatures concealed in a new stronghold to the
south-east of Lag are being whispered by merchants and travellers alike. 
Merchants now refuse to travel near the place due to their carts being
ransacked and merchants devoured by these monsters.  Allegations of these
powerful beings having journeyed from distant lands, seeking new nations
to be conquered.  As time goes by the creatures have time to grow in
strength and number and to spread across the land like a plague.~

0 0 0 Dero Lair~
.Perhaps kin to dwarves or gnomes, the diminutive dero lack any of the
artisan skills of either.  Instead, they make a living by murder and
thievery, challenging even the ratkin in brutality and mischief making. 
Sunlight they hate, all other races they hate, only pausing to kill, eat
or enslave anyone they run across.  Despite their size, they have a giant
appetite when it comes to precious metals and gems, putting slaves - even
the lesser of their own kin - to work in mines to extract what they can
not steal.  Lead by a vicious war leader, packs of dero sulk in the
darkness of forgotten catacombs and caverns, waiting for their next
victim.

.@CSYNTAX@n

@Gdescription <line of your description>@n :
                      sets a line of your description
   This command uses the standard editor - see help editor for a list
   and description of how to write a description for yourself.
   NOTE: Description does not use many of the commands that are unique
   to note and mail, such as send, post, and delete.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Using the @Cdescription@n command, you can write a block of text describing
your character's physical characteristics.  It is displayed either when
someone looks at you, or uses the @Cqlook@n command.  Your description should
include what your character looks like as well as any other information you
feel someone could gather from your appearance.

It should not include emotions or anything which another player could not
realistically gather from merely looking at you.

Please note that a description is generally at least one paragraph of at
least a half-dozen or so sentences in length.  Writing your @Gdescription@n,
@Gappearance@n and @Gkeywords@n is @Cmandatory@n for advancing beyond the fifth level
of experience.

@CGUIDELINES@n

* Should be at least five complete sentences.
* The same rules as to what doesn't go for @Cappearance@n applies here as
       well. No auras, abnormal things like two-heads, etc.
* Do not include your name or class in your description.
* Do NOT force the judgment of the viewer, i.e. "You become afraid,"
    "you get hungry just looking at...," you want to beat his head in."
* Do NOT include actions, i.e., "As you watch, his hair turns pink," "He
    grabs a tree and uproots it."
* Do NOT include clothing or other removeable objects.  Tattoos, items
    braided into hair/beard, and scars are fine, though.
* Do NOT capitalize race in your description or appearance.
* DO include things such as eyecolor, hair color, height,
    race (flaunt those elf ears and troll warts), and other physical
    characteristics.
* DO spell out words for numbers instead of using digits, i.e.  ten
    instead of 10.

@CEXAMPLE@n
Long, lean muscles cover a body without a trace of extraneous fat.  The
pale lavender skin is unblemished and unlined, not an imperfection
showing anywhere.  Pure white hair, with not a trace of gray, is pulled
back away from the bony face, and flows in orderly waves just past this
vyan's shoulders.  A small braid of white, twined with a dark, amethyst
ribbon, falls over high cheekbones and down the right side of the face
and neck.  Pure white brows soar archedly over light purple eyes ringed
with the deepest midnight blue.  The svelte figure has very few curves,
just barely enough to indicate that this vyan is female.~

0 0 19 Desert of the Four Sands~
.Endurus, a gnomen geomancer, recently returned from the far west.  While
looking for his father, an adventurer who disappeared over two hundred
years ago, Endurus was trapped in a landslide.  Once he freed himself, he
soon discovered a path which led through a twisting canyon into a vast
desert.  Excited that he had finally found the Desert of the Four Sands,
Endurus, like his father before him, struck out on a mission of
exploration, leaving his magical studies behind for a time.

Sadly, when Endurus returned from the desert, he returned with little
additional knowledge about his father's disappearance.  However, Endurus
did discover that what his father called the 'Desert of the Four Sands'
was truly the Naraki Desert.  Apparently a minor earthquake had sealed it
off from the rest of the main continent.

Endurus also learned why his father's journals spoke of the Naraki as
having four sands.  For indeed, within the Naraki Desert, a barren land
caught within a series of twisted canyons, Endurus found that the desert
soils were of four different colors.

Each, Endurus discovered, had its own secrets and mysteries that need be
unearthed.  But the most spectacular thing about his visit, he has been
heard to remark, was the giant stone structure situated in the middle of
the desert.  Though he could find no way into the structure, Endurus has
vowed one day to return.  Perhaps, within it, lie clues to his father's
whereabouts.~

0 0 19 Desert Ogre Caves~
.Centuries ago when the land of Tarik Nor was being invaded by the demons
of the Abyss, several bands of ogres fled into underground caverns to
escape their wrath.  To the ogres surprise the demons found them;
however, before the demons had a chance to slay them, the band of desert
ogres stepped forth and offered them a deal.  It is said that in exchange
for god-like powers and their lives the desert ogres would seek out
anything that was good left in the land and slay them.  Legends tell that
the demons accepted the deal and granted the ogres incredible strength,

killed by some unseen foe.
     
The Gnomish Government has released this exert from the final report
received from the scouting party: 
    
Day 1
We have found an entrance into the strange clearing yesterday and have
spent the night just inside the vast opening.  We will rest for the night
after an altercation with a strange group of frog men.  We plan on
sending a small group deeper in tomorrow.  If this group is successful we
will map the area and continue on to Sos-Kul.
     
Day 2
The small party we sent into the clearing has not returned.  The clearing
is completely free from the elements.  The canopy that covers it provides
us shelter from the brutal weather of the swamp.  We plan on going in
after the initial party this afternoon and then continue on to Sos-Kul.

0 0 15 Druids~
.Druids are the guardians of nature and are bestowed with gifts of magic
to enable them to protect their habitat.  Typically a druid will pick one
area and protect it from outside hazards, however, younger druids are
known to wander the land learning what they can from all the different
habitats they can observe before settling down.  All druids are at home
with nature and find civilization to be somewhat unsettling as most
civilized races must coerce the land and its nature to make it
"civilized".  Druids are in many ways similar to rangers in their love of
nature and the abilities given them.  Where a ranger can be said to be
the physical warrior of nature the druid is gifted more strongly in the
way of magic.  Druidic spells are primarily concerned with effects found
in nature.  After studying the ways of plants and animals a druid can
learn to shape change into many of the life forms they come into contact
with.  Druids are also given some ability to repair the wounds of the
world and heal wounds.  Druids will not use bladed weapons since bladed
weapons are one of the greatest threats to a forest's growth and well
being.  They also typically avoid the use of metal armor as it both
 requires significant damage to unearth most times and interferes with
their magics.  The lesser amount of metals in such weapons as mace heads
and hammer heads are considered a tolerable cost to accept in lieu of
their ability to safely wield in defending the woods.

0 0 0 Duergar~
.Average Statistics for Duergar

Height: male and female about 3'6" - 4'6"

Hair: Primarily shades of grey from medium to dark, rarely any lighter. 
Some older Duergar have been known to have their hair go white, but this
is rare and considered a throw back to their Dwarven origins.
All Duergar have thick grey beards matching the colour of their hair,
though it has become the trend among many Duergar to shave the top lip
lending their beard more of a face-framing quality.

Eyes: Shades of grey, occasionally so dark as to appear black.  Rarely
any lighter than medium grey.

Appearance: Duergar differ from their dwarven cousins in many key areas. 
Their skin is almost exclusively a mid grey in colour, generally a shade
or two lighter than their hair but rarely altering far to the darker or
lighter side from mid grey.  Duergar are quite a bit thinner than
dwarves, less broad across the shoulder and often less muscular.

Optional Advice on Role Playing a Duergar

Duergar are considered an evil race by many, and though one may find the
occasional individual with a more neutral calling in life you would never
find a Duergar supporting the cause of good.
Duergar society exists underground, and as such most duergar will have
spent the vast majority of their lives underground, giving rise to an
innate fear and distrust of all surface dwelling creatures.  Living
underground has also made the duergar most comfortable in darkness to the
extent that they will go out of their way to avoid exposing themselves to
excess light, particularly the daytime.
The influence this has had on the duergar as a race is marked, they are
most comfortable sneaking around and keeping to the shadows whenever
possible, lending to the rather natural feeling of distrust that they
provoke in most other races.

Racial Relations:

Duergar have inherited the ability (talent?) to hold a grudge to the
extreme from their cousins the dwarves.

Dwarves cannot be abided.  Duergar and dwarves hold a deepset and
unyielding hatred of everything the other embodies.  Other light races
are viewed with suspicion, although the duergar's withdrawn society means
that they have had little contact with these races and as such have not
had an opportunity to build up any substantial grudge.

Vyans are feared and mistrusted due to a past history ivolving
inslavement of the duergar by the vyans.

Goblins are the only race with which the duergar have friendly relations
due to colaberation in the past and the duergar's innate feeling of
superiority over goblinkind.

0 0 19 Dulthor's Hold~
.Perched on the edge of a great bay that lies far to the north of Kha-da,
the quaint village of Dulthor's Hold takes its name from the old wizard
who constructed the nearby watchtower.  Originally designed to give
Kha-da forewarning of sea attacks by orc raiders and gnoll marauders, the
ancient structure has become the focal point of several peoples.  Tall
seafaring humans of the far north have created a small township around
the base of the tower, trading gems, foodstuffs and magics for iron
weapons and scholarly objects.  The importance of a deep bay that allows
sizable ships to berth has ensured the steady growth of the village. 
Despite the mist-shrouded nature of the coast, the inhabitants are often
described as warm and open, unlike the suspicious demeanor that clings to
the inland folk.

0 0 7 Duroth~
.@BDuroth@n of the Forge - God of the Earth and all that lies beneath.

Deep within the fires of the towering mountains burns a raging heat so
intense, yet so pure, that metals succumb so easily to the mouldings of
those who work with the various ore found here.  Items created in this
brutal area are flawless in every detail; tarnish and rust cannot touch
the fabric of metal forged here.  No mortal has ever been able to
withstand the legendary flames; however, there is one being who makes
this inhospitable environment his foundry.  His enemies are many,
consisting mostly of the orcs and ogres that make up the followers of
Ragezer, a god of evil who claims the earth as his domain alone.

Duroth of the Forge as his followers know him, is the god of the earth
itself, the mountains, and all of the land and caverns beneath.  Being
such, he knows of all minerals and gem veins in the earth's depths, and
forging weapons, armour, and jewellery items of high qualities are all
highly important to him.  Also important to an extent, though somewhat
more so to the boisterous dwarves, who make up the brunt of his
followers, is the small matter of brewing through cracks in the rocks and
caves that make up their underground homes.  Such alcohol usually has a
very gritty and strong taste, the 'holy water' of his priests.

Other than the dwarves, some gnomish tribes, which dwell below the earth
have an inclination to follow Duroth, and can be almost as skilled at his
crafts.  Many members of other races with a more 'earthy' feel also
follow his ways.  Beyond that, he is not worshipped by many who do not
have a strong interest in the earth, gemstones, or the art of forging,
though all those with a taste in fine and strong drinks at least know his
name to have someone to toast for the next round.  When he appears to his
followers, it is said to be as an old but fit dwarf who sports an unruly
and singed white beard, balding head, and carries a forging hammer (and
sometimes a pick) of a strong, silvery metal and a fine suit of mail to
match, or alternatively, as a mighty earth elemental.  His symbol is the
aforementioned hammer, smashing against an anvil and scattering white-hot
sparks in a wide radius.~

Height: male and female about 3'6" - 4'6"

Hair: primarily black to dark brown, lighter brown
      and blond are rare.  Gray in old age.
      ALL DWARVES (male and female) HAVE BEARDS.

Eyes: Black, brown, gray, green, and rarely blue iris.
      White around the iris, though the iris is large.

Dwarves are a light race, and restricted to good and neutral alignment.

Appearance: Dwarves are noted primarily for two traits.
First, dwarves are shorter than humans and have broad shoulders.
Second, all dwarves have beards.  While you could possibly shave every
day, every other dwarf is encouraged to shun, taunt and torment beardless
dwarves at every given opportunity.
Dwarves tend to have hearty, strong appearances and are generally adapted
to living in the harsh conditions of the northern Cairn mountains.  They
frequently have dusky, leathery looking skin that protects them from both
chill wind, glaring sun and rugged terrain.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Dwarf@n

Dwarves come from a culture that cherishes two things above all others. 
Family and work.  Most dwarves will place family and clan above friends. 
Sure, a human makes a good aquaintence, but if it came to a choice of
friends of family, family will win hands down every time.
Since family is rarely threatened, except maybe by orc or goblin raids in
the mountains, outsiders more often see the dwarven work ethic come into
play.  A pride in work done, most often with the hands.  In many cases
this means well cared for equipment, fine smithing (one of major exports
of the main dwarven citadel, Kha-da) and a belief that a job worth doing
is worth doing right.
Most other races will see dwarves as obstinate and gruff.  These are more
realisticly just the visual appearance of their ethics.  If something
falls into a category their ethics already cover, it takes little thought
and there is almost no chance of changing a dwarf's mind once its made up
on such a basis.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Dwarves prize other dwarves above all else, making for a pretty gruff
appearance at best to outsiders they do like, let alone ones they don't.

Dwarves have an undying hatred for several races - among them goblins,
orcs, trolls and ogres.  Of these all, dwarves can not stand goblins who
are, to them, less than worthless theives who should be burried under the
next collapsed tunnel.

Vyans are perceived as a particularly sinister threat due to their
obvious intelligence and particularly vile brand of evil.

Elves are viewed with a measure of skepticism, at times bordering on
contempt.  Severe differences in dwarven and elven attitude make elves
seem capricious and frivolous, something no self-respecting dwarf would
find desirable (see notes on dwarven work ethic).

Humans, on the whole, are seen as unnecessarily volatile and a race which
really hasn't finished its adolesence, grown up, or figured out what it
wants to do with itself.

Lizardmen are considered somewhat of a boggle for dwarves, sharing no
common territories of cultural ideologies that would bring them closer
together or further apart.

Gnomes are considered to be most agreeable, sensible folks closest to
dwarves in attitude and demeaner.

Halflings are considered somewhat reliable if a bit too care-free and are
viewed somewhere between gnomes and humans.  While they can be sensible
folk when it comes to settling down and tilling the earth or working, and
they don't just rush into things, they are just so darned merry all the
time even when there's no good reason to be.~

0 0 19 Ebon Citadel~
.Ages past...
     Times change...
           Heroes forgotten...

Once, long ago...  Before the times of strife and distrust, the light and
dark races occasionally saw past thier differences and banded together to
fight common enemies.  These common enemies were numerous; most still
plague the lands even today...  Frost giants, Storm giants, evil
mutations of nature, rogue ogres and of course dragons.  Out of the
darkness of battles, clans arose to forge ahead and protect their members. 
Though few allowed for the light and dark races to mingle it inevitably
happened, alliances were forged and mortals gained even more power,
rumors say some gained the powers of the gods themselves.

Then Darkness....

Though it was a time few talk about, the darkness struck out and
destroyed the mortals and most of what they had built...  Though very
little is all-inclusive and as such the races of the land survived. 
Towns were rebuilt, a new generation was born and once again battle was a
way of life, no longer did the light and dark races pretend to trust each
other, each instead blaming the other for the times past.  Historians
have searched for the complete records of the land, but large gaps
abound, seemingly the gods themselves wiped out nearly all knowledge of
the past generation of heroes.

Rumors have begun to surface that the dark and deadly Cult of Xharax
have found and claimed an ancient stronghold of power as their own. 
Coupled with this rumor are the acts of an aging member of the Medienne
guard, his claim that he was actually alive before the darkness came is
dubious at best.  This gentleman recently posted a note in the Rusty
Nail, stating that it was actually from a young elf who has not walked
the human lands in some time, this has been wholly disbelieved by the
general populace.~

.The trails around Kha-da have become much more dangerous to travel
recently.  While the dwarves have always had skirmishes with the goblins
around the area, something far more sinister seems to be hunting the high
mountain tracks.
While larger groups have been left unmolested, smaller groups have
disappeared entirely, often without a trace as if they had been snatched
from the ground.  Rumors abound about what could be happening, and even
ancient myths of a dragon that once prowled the icy peaks are being
dicussed hushedly by the concerned folk of Kha-da.
Perhaps because of this, goblin activity in the area has increased.
The goblins have taken advantage of the dwarves attention being focused
elsewhere, and have begun to multiply and grow stronger.  Some goblins
have been seen by patrols wearing dwarf armor, and once or twice have
even dared to attack the dwarves.
With the kobolds, goblins, and whatever is causing these mysterious
disappearances, Kha-da is under considerable stress.  Perhaps a brave
band of adventurers can discover and crush whoever or whatever is behind
the problems plaguing the beleagered dwarves of Kha-da.~

The spell went off prematurly and devestated the area with such force
that it blew the poor elementalist half a days walk away.  When he found
his way back to the area he saw the once beautiful grassy plain had been
burnt to a crisp.  Using his magic he could sense that something had
changed beneath the soil.  Calling upon the last of his strength he cast
his last spell surrounding the area in walls rock traping what ever
damage he had done.  As the town of Zirnath grows it sends its scouts out
in every direction.  Some have returned with rumors of a burnt field
surrounded by great boulders, but none that have ventured within have

        females about 4'6"-5'6"

Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white/blond) to a darkish brown.
      Very rarely black.  Elves have no facial hair.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      brown or blue, though other colors such as amber, lavender
      or other light colors are not wholely uncommon.

Affiliation: Elves are a light race restricted to good or neutral
alignment.

Appearance: Elves look much like humans though they generally have a
smaller, slenderer build than humans.  Elves tend to have smooth,
unblemished skin ranging in all normal human skin tones and what humans
would refer to as an ethereal beauty.  Their skin tone is almost always
touched by the healthy glow of sunlight or the silver sheen akin of
moonlight.  Their appearance often gives them an air of regal grace and
their stoic appearance gives them a haughty, uncaring appearance.
Elves age extremely slowly.  You probably won't see wrinkles before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for a few hundred more years.  Elven hair
typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a
thousand years of age, if at all.
Elves have ears that are upswept and pointed.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Elf@n

Elves refer to themselves not as elves, but as llewyrr; elf being a term
humans devised.  All elves on Legacy's Dawning originated from the Vaasa,
whether that means they were born there, their parent were, or at the
most their grandparents were.  The elves of the Vaasa share a very strong
sense of cohesiveness, primarily due to their status as an elder race in
tune with all the forces of nature.  For this reason the elves of the
Vaasa consider any elf kindred, even if that elf was born outside the
Vaasa and knows nothing of it.
Elves tend to hold themselves aloof from all races save other elves and
occasionally ents.  Long years of dealing with dark races followed by
long years of miscommunication between humans and elves (resulting in
several wars, the most recent of which nearly destroyed Medienne and only
ended a scant few decades ago) has caused the elves as a race to become
withdrawn from other races.
Elves tend to prefer nature colors of green and brown that helps them
blend in to the surrounding forest.  Many elves born outside the Vaasa
prefer to wear other colors chosen to display their ethereal beauty to
its best advantage, another trait Vaasa born elves tend to eschew as much
as calling themselves elves.


@yRacial Relations:@n
After centuries of dealing with the hostile invasions of outsides elves
are quite withdrawn.  They view only elves and ents as trusted insiders.

Elves consider halflings a joy of the world and view them as one might a
cute child, though they offer them the respect due their age.

After losing the whole of the Medienne wood, once a part of the Vaasa, to
the humans and years of warfare humans and elves have only recently begun
to trust one another again.  Elves consider humans a goodly race, though
once betrayed are quite willing to hunt down humans on an individual
basis.

Elves treat lizardfolk, dwarves and gnomes with caution having little
understanding of what drives them nor reason to distrust them.  As they
serve the light they make good allies in a pinch and, at the least, they
are less mercurial than humans.

Elves hate all races that serve the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres, and
trolls) but they especially loathe their close kin the Vyans.  Vyans are
quite obviously related to elves though a distant schism between the two
races has caused an enmity that has become the typical embodiment of
light versus dark.~

forms (unless you've given your character a very low strength and
constitution).  Ents are not treants and do not have bark, sap or leaves.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Ent@n

The ent is the largest of the humanoids that tends towards the side of
light and goodness and, as such, most are slow to anger realizing their
great size and strength can cause great devastation and they would not
want to cause undue harm to innocents by mistake.  Somewhere in the
time-shrouded past ents became the primary caretakers of the plants of
the ancient forests, primarily the Vaasa, and they usually live
peacefully among the elves of the wood.  Most ents are slow to speak or
act as they have long life-spans and have lived so long tending the great
and ancient plants of the Vaasa that they have become accustomed to the
slow pace of life, having time to consider without rash action.


@yRacial Relations:@n
After long association with the elves of the Vaasa, ents consider them
good friends.

Somewhere in the past ents and halfling met and each seem to share
stories about the other race and consider each other good folk.  Ents
find great amusement in watching the apparantly hasty, but good-natured
doings of halflings.

Ents deal fairly well with gnomes and dwarves as they are usually known to
serve the forces of light and goodness, though ents tend to readily admit
they do not understand these ground-dwelling races.

Ents deal with humans and lizardfolk fairly as well and more frequently
than gnomes and dwarves.  Most often humans and lizardfolk are dealt with
on a case by case basis as both races seem to fall squarely in the middle
of the matter of light versus dark.

Being a race that so whole-heartedly accepted the tenets of light, ents
typically abhor any race that serves the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres,
trolls and vyans) and would be hard-pressed to come to simple terms with
one who professed to have a goodly nature.  In time, perhaps, a member of
the dark races could prove themselves to an ent, but far too frequently
such tactics have been little more than ploys to wreak more havoc upon
ents or elves.~

0 0 1 Find Familiar~
.Find familiar is the mid-level spell which allows a mage to find just the
perfect beast to meld with.  It can be successfully cast once per the
mage's level and a mage can only have one familiar at any given time. 
The familiar must be attracted by a specific type of reagent, and vary
based upon the mage's alignment.
 
Familiars are not always as strong as many pets, but the mage has the
ability to view and act through its eyes, making them good scouts.  They
can also be used to get into small areas.  Also, some familiars are
highly magical, and bestow magical abilities upon their master when with
them.  When switched, a familiar suffers the same penalties as its mage
would.
 
To switch into your famliar, the command is @Gswitch@n.  To return to
your body, the command is @Greturn@n.
 
@GPossible familiars for good-aligned mages are@n:
ulannu jays, giant white rabbits, white cats, fades, white riding horses,
woodworm adults, war dogs, mother eagles, white stags, and motes.

@CNeutral mages may bond with@n:
moose, giant brown rabbits, tabby cats, brown bears, grey wolves, riding
horses, psuedo-dragons, giant preying mantises, adult white-tailed
eagles, and stags.

@GEvil-aligned mages may choose from@n:
twisted foxes, wasps, bone bears, twisted wolves, black riding horses,
screech owls, mountain lions, giant bats, rabid dogs, or ornacs.

@C*****@n

By the time a mage reaches the level of being able to find their perfect
familiar, they should know these beasts well enough to know what is
likely to attract them.

.Brithbarad has been abustle about rumors of an underground cavern located
somewhere north of the city.  Several orcs have come home with fiery
lacerations on their bodies, but they are silent about it and only curse
their luck at not finding the treasures believed to have been there. 
Reports of strange, red lizards have been the talk of the town as well,
and many believe these creatures responsible for an orc chieftain who was
found dead from burning scars just outside the rumoured area.~

.~

0 0 1 Fire shield~
.A potent spell, recently arrived to the continent from distant lands. 
The target of this enchantment becomes engulfed in leaping flames of
burning blue and white-hot amethyst.  While he himself cannot feel the
raging heat give off by this globe of crackling flame, those which try to
do damage to his person must penetrate the flames in order to reach him.~

.~

0 0 1 Fireball~
.A potent spell which harnesses the unpredictable energies of magical fire. 
Some flint is used as a trigger for the spell.  The spell creates a
very small sphere of oscillating yellow-white which drifts almost lazily
from the caster's fingertip.  At a completing word of power, the sphere
explodes.  Some of the more powerful magi have been known to channel
enough energy through the gate, that things are actually blown out of the
room.~

0 0 1 Firefly~
.This spell allows a druid to call upon the small, and wild fireflies to
help light his way.  The array of colors they can come in are almost
awe-inspiring.  The insects are known to be relatively noisy in the wild,
yet when assisting a druid in this manner they are deathly quiet.
~

0 0 1 Flame Strike~
.More than just a more powerful version of fireball, this high level mage
spell unleashes elemental fire upon its target.  The mage draws in the
power of his or her surroundings and unleashes that power in the form of
a streak of white-hot flame which engulfs the victim.~

0 0 17 Flee~
.@CSYNTAX@n

flee : attempts to make you flee from current battle
flee <direction> : attempts to flee from battle in a specified direction

@CDESCRIPTION@n
This command is very useful when you find that you are in a losing battle
situation.  You lose some experience points for fleeing with amount loss
dependent on how powerful and badly hurt the foe is.  However, the amount
loss is usually minimal compared to the amount loss from death.  So
sometimes it may be better to flee to live to fight another day, rather
than be brave and die today.

NOTE: This command is not fail proof, and you may sometimes not be able
to flee due to lack of movement points, being bashed, bad luck, or
whatever.

.Long before cities were established, the races were barbaric and
scattered across the realm.  Some met and traded basic goods, but others
were not even this advanced.  Nearly all of these peoples lived in tribes
and clans.
One such clan was the Clan of the Wolf, who took shelter in caverns and
hunted for their food.  What is known about this clan of primitive humans
has only recently been discovered.  By sheer chance, the caverns they
resided in have been discovered and partly explored.  Found just north of
the present day city of Chiiron, the secrets remaining within the Wolf
Clan's caverns and tombs are currently unknown.~

.Is it cold in here, or is it just me?  The caster chills the air,

0 0 19 Frostfur Woods~
.Cloaked in a perpetual winter's blanket, the Frostfur Woods takes its
name from the icy coating and the tribes of gnolls inhabiting its dark
reaches.  Nestled in amongst the Everwinter Mountains, the forest offers
food and shelter to its inhabitants.  Various types of trees are found
amongst the woods, although the dominant ones are firs.  Toward its
eastern boundaries, the remains of a dwarven city spread out over its
outer rim, being slowly absorbed by the expanding forest.  Little is
known of the gnolls in this part of the world; although no encounters
have been overly aggressive, perhaps their guarding warders protect the
tribe's homeland from prying eyes.  Built so near to a ruin it wouldn't
be unlikely to find some treasure delved from the city within the hold.

are particularly choosy about this.
  
Statements not found with the function command:

@b@Wcontinue;@n
  Stops execution of code and allows parser to continue evaluating

  command processor, so if you want (for instance) a leaving trigger
  to allow the triggerer to leave, you must use continue;, otherwise
  they will stay put.

@b@Wend;@n
  Stops execution of code.

@b@Wif( expression ) { < statment(s) > }@n
@b@Welse { <statment(s) > }@n

Look before you leap.  All major/important changes are posted on either
the @Cmotd@n, which you see on log in or can read through help, or on the
@Cannouncements noteboard@n.
  
If you charge into combat, only to find some command vital to your
success has changed, odds are it was posted and there will be no
reimbursements of death for it.  The exception to this rule is mobs. 
Sometimes (rarely) a mob may change a little.  If it is found that a mob
is extremely susceptable to some new skill, they may be granted something
to compensate.  It is always a good idea to @Cconsider@n a mob before
attacking it.  Look before you leap.

                             -------------

This game is a role-playing adventure.  In it, you will experience many
joys, adventures, perils, and quite possibly face death.  We have worked
hard to convey to you our image of this world, and ask that in your
decision to join it you take a few things into consideration.  

First, in this world, it behooves you to chose a character style and 
follow it throughout your lifespan - people do not recognize you by name,
and must therefore become familiar with your style of speech and manner of
of actions. The setting of this game is a parallel universe to ours in a
time equivalent to our Dark Ages.

Second, we emphasize realism in this game.  This means that times are
quite tough for all players.  There are thieves and murderers, corrupt
guards and officials, and demonic cults.  By the same token, however,
there are an equal number of valiant knights and their vassals, holy
clerics, and wise mages.  Beware to treat all in such a manner that you
wish to be treated, and do not be gracious with trust - trust should be
earned, not given.  ~

.~

0 0 3 Gamedesc_2~
.Third, we have a policy which states that the immortals of this mud shall
not interfere in player disputes. Should you and a fellow player find
yourselves at odds, then find an appropriate means to deal with it. Ask
a passerby to moderate your discussion, ignore each other, have it out in
battle, start a war between your clans, etc. Perhaps you may even wish to
pray to your chosen deity for guidance.

Fourth, much adventure lies in the completion of campaigns. You will be
required to complete numerous campaigns throughout your lifespan here. It
is our policy that players not share information regarding campaigns with
other players. We actively enforce this by modifying campaigns on a per-
character basis, so that no two campaigns are ever exactly the same.

Additionally, we are working on an extensive faction system, whereby
players are brought into the game belonging to no faction, and may be
recruited into a faction once playing.  The factions will have a loosely
defined power structure which will will be as volatile as the members of
the faction.  It is not uncommon for a faction leader to be unseated by a
an underling, nor is it unheard of to find that two factions have merged
to become more powerful.  Factions are both tools of strategic importance
and means of safety for their members.  Take great care in your
decisions.  ~

0 0 7 Gandin~
.@YGandin@n - Lord of Storms and the Oceans and all that lies beneath.

For as long as records have been kept of this planet there has existed
the vast oceans and the life that thrives within it.  These oceans'
boundaries have grown and shrunk with the passing of time.  Gandin's
power seems to rise and fall in accordance with the dynamic size of his
domain.  Gandin's temperament also seems to echo the happenings of the
ocean waters or perhaps it is the other way around and the mood of Gandin
reflects the tidal conditions.  Whichever it may be one thing is for
certain; all that use the rolling oceans to travel are subject to the
whims and wants of this seemingly chaotic god.  Even those at the
boundaries of this vast and virtually unexplored realm are subjugated to
the thrashings that Gandin can cause.

Worshipped mostly by the seafaring and those who dwell in coastal towns,
Gandin's people are always neutral in their outlook on life.  Neither
supporting the good nor the evil, they care only about their sanctity of
their oceans and seas, feeling the salt breeze on their cheeks and living
life on the rolling waves.  Their major enemies are those champions of
Chandros of Khalmor who see the world in plain black and white, and
represent the two extremes that Gandin seeks to avoid.  Both of the
aforementioned gods also have an interest in fire, and as such, Gandin
sees them as a threat to extinguishing his domain.

When he appears before his followers, it is usually as a huge water
elemental rising from the depths of the sea, creating massive waves, with
a calm spot somehow around the ship of his followers, sparing them from
harm.  He is also known to appear as an angry face in the storm clouds,
spreading his wrath across the world.  His symbol is that of a gigantic
blue-green tidal wave, breaking against the rocky shore, to symbolize how
he will erode away the very world itself, given time.~

.Thieves, always so interested in causing death instantaneously, have long
tried perfecting the art of the garotte, the method wherein the thief
uses a thin coil of wire (or other cord type object) and attempts to

enough, and using the proper type of garotte, he will behead his victim.

16 0 26 Geography~
.This continent is extremely active on a geological scale. The basic makeup
consists of three tectonic plates, with another three affecting them from
the ocean depths.  The map is purposefully sterile, so that we can alter
the world to our needs.

The southwestern section of the continent is termed 'The Plains of Anam'. 
The area is extremely fertile due to the three main rivers of the
continent providing water for the area.  This is basically the 'bread
basket' of the continent a la US Midwest.

The eastern section of the continent is rolling plains, including beyond
the cold line, where they turn into sub-arctic rolling plains gradually. 
Eventually this will be Tundra-type terrain 

The islands to the south are technically glaciers, covered in ice and
inhospitable to most creatures, they will be useable for zones after we
add in boat travel.  These islands were created via an impact site of a
very large meteor.  The single island in the center with a mountain would
be either extremely magical or a magical dead zone probably based on the
properties of the meteor.

Most shipping will occur from the western bay toward the north, very
little travel would occur through the southern waters, any city there
would send goods via land, over a mountain trail and across the wide
plains, rather than brave the ice-ridden southern ocean.  The small plot
of land on the extreme northwestern corner of the map, (could be an
island, could be yet another small continent) should have a pirate town
on it, it would be the logical place for them to be.  Their placement
there would allow them to intercept ships traveling between the good
towns on the oceans.

The salt lake in the middle of the twin mountain ranges is a legitimate
geological occurrence, highly saturated and with absolutely no river,
either above ground or below feeding into or out of it.  This occurred
because the northwestern plate is pulling away from the southeastern and
western plates, at the same time the southeastern and western plates are
colliding, causing the mountain ranges.

The twin mountain ranges are extremely geologically active earthquakes
and volcanoes are abundant.  Mar Quoith situated around the small valley
that has a bay access in the southern half of the eastern most mountain
range.  The city being there would also allow raids on the farmers in the
western plain.  The twin mountain ranges are extremely large, about the
size of the Himalayas, which of course has peaks tens of thousands of
feet high.

Dun Tathaig (main light city, although light is hardly the proper term
for such a place) should be on the western bay, with a second city at the
base of the mountains by the river that leads to it.  This river would
allow very quick travel time between the two cities.  There would almost
definitely be a third city at the mouth of the second river to the south
of that, allowing even more shipping of goods between the three towns. 
The large eastern lake would no doubt have a canal built on it leading
out to the northern bay where there would be yet another city.

The mountain range on the western continent would probably house the
dwarves as these will be the oldest mountains.  Very little geological
activity occurs with them, though there is a small plate that still
affects them, they are in no way as active as the twin mountain ranges.

These are the notes Adakar sent me to accompany the map I should be
receiving early next week.  All names (I added them) are subject to
change.~

0 0 7 Ghnomb~
.@RGhnomb@n - God of Eating and hunger.

Known as the Devourer, Ghnomb is a source of insatiable hunger that knows
no bounds.  Where he dwells is unknown, but he is known to hunt all over
the earth, searching for prey to fill his stomach.  The main reason this
slavering evil took on followers is because their sacrifices serve to
feed his hunger.  Mostly trolls, whose desire for things to eat and
hunting serves his purposes well, worship him.  To them, he is the God of
'Eat' and covers all-important details of life, such as eating things,
killing things so you can eat them, and hunting things to eat.

Other than the trolls, few people worship Ghnomb, though a rare few orcs,
goblins, and ogres may follow him.  All recognize his presence though,
and many fear angering a troll shaman whom might decide turn the offender
into the next meal of the Great One's hunger.  His worshippers have no
real specific enemies, for life is generally as simple as eating anyone
who does not aid you, but they have a special like of attacking the
villages to which Shinanne offers her protection, for they always have
bountiful harvests and a lot of food to eat.

Those who see Ghnomb are invariably eaten, though his shamans have
reported his appearance for all to know and fear.  He appears to them as
a large, two-headed troll with dark green skin, eyes of pure black, and a
strong, muscular body.  His claws are of obsidian and razor sharp, and
his fangs are covered in blood and gore.  His most striking feature is a
large, jawed mouth where his stomach would be, its teeth constantly
gnashing and biting, waiting for food.  His symbol is that of a rabid
dire wolf, its hungry jaws wide open, stains of blood on its dark coat.~

0 0 1 Ghost Armor~
.The spell calls upon the dark spirits to protect their ward from physical
and magical damage.  A ghostly armor surrounds the target, increasing
their ability to absorb damage.  Although not an evil spell, the spirits
are often reluctant to impart their protection on those whose ethos does
not match their own.
~

.Effect -- Adds +2 global ac and +2% to all resists for evil/neutral
characters 
Reagent -- Nill
Resist -- Nill
cast_mess The ghostly figures suround $n cloaking them in a misty armor
cast_end The misty armor departs back to the grave
~

0 0 1 Ghost Chains~
.Often the opening attack of a sorcerer, the spell summons grasping
ghostly chains that can entangle even ethereal creatures, binding them to
the ground.  Once captured, the sorcerer can then unleash their disease
and poison attacks with little fear of reprisal.  Even when the bonds
break, a targets movement remains somewhat restricted for a period of
time beyond the initial imprisonment.  The spell works best on
human-sized creatures, the chains often too weak to bind those of the
giant races.
~

.Effect -- Entangles target, reduces Move by 15+(L*3)
Reagents: -- tiny link of silver chain (consumed)
Resist -- Magic

~

0 0 1 Ghost Shield~
.The dark ritual summons forth a swarm of demonic spirits that enshroud a
target in an angry swirl of ghostly energy.  Any creature unfortunate
enough to even brush against the maddened souls feels their wraith upon
them.  Due to the evil aura of the ghost shield, it is unwise to bestow
their gift upon someone who follows the path of light.

.It was late in the autumn when they came, nasty to the extreme and vile
as the most putrid of rotting meats.  Spottings of wildlife in the

support the utter destruction that has arrived in this world.  Giant
moles with teeth as sharp as razors, claws as tough as krynite, eyes as
beady as...well...beads.

Be wary all those that wish to tresspass into the den of the moles,
for it is perilous and would surely lead to the death of all who would
enter their lair.

After many winters druids often begin to emulate the sleep patterns of
the bear, and are able to learn the bears gift of hardiness.

.With the aid of the summer spirits and the essence of the great cat it is
possible to harness some of strength and battle prowess of the mountain
lion.
~

.~

0 0 1 Gift of the Night~
.Using shadow magic, the sorcerer invades a target's mind with terrifying
nightmares which crush their sanity and inflicts a horrid suffering upon
them.  Once under the effect of the mind blow, the victim is also easier
to damage with other nightmare based attacks.  Like all nightmare based
spells, the target must have a mind to effect, making this spell useless
on elementals, some undead and similar creatures.
~

.Effect -- 2d6+(L*2), -2+(L*3)mind resist debuff -- this spell needs to
check warm blooded or simillar flag 
Reagent -- Book of lies, bat tongue

wyrm, increasing their fighting prowess greatly.

0 0 1 Gift of Tongues~
.This spell enables the person it is cast upon to understand and speak in
all the languages used by mortals who populate this realm.  High-level
clerics are able to cast it upon themselves in order to better spread the
word of their god amongst their followers; others may occasionally find
an item to help them temporarily communicate with others.~

.~

0 0 1 Gloom~
.The spell enshrouds the target in an aura of darkness and despair that
erodes their ability to fight effectively.  Under the cloud of gloom, the
target often misses and stumbles as they fight through a haze of
shadows.

.Effects -- a short lasting curse, reduces attack chance and some move points
Reagents --  none

0 0 19 Glory Hole Mine~
.@I Stories are often told of a great mine that yielded vast quantities of
gems and other wealth to the gnomes.  The mine was called the Glory Hole,
and for centuries it brought great wealth to the gnomes of Orlumber.  The
gnomes delved deep into the earth in search of wealth, and it seemed to
some that the Glory Hole would never run out of riches.  A steady stream
of gems and precious metals came from the mine.
@I Some tales say that something sinister happened in the mine, that the
gnomes came upon and loosed a great evil deep within the bowels of the
earth.  Others merely say that the mine stopped producing and was
abandoned.  The truth may never be known.~

0 0 10 Gnomes~
.@GAverage Statistics for Gnomes@n

Height: males about 3'6" - 4'6"
        females about 3'4" - 4'4"

Hair: most commonly darker shades of black or brown though
      shades of blond and grey are not unheard of.
      A dusky red is, at best, quite rare.

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green, Grey (usually dark) and black.
      large pupils centered in large irises surrounded by white.

Affiliation: gnomes are a light race and restricted too good and neutral
alignments.

Appearance: Gnomes are shorter than humans, typically more slender than
halflings, and less broad than a dwarf.  Though gnomish skin tones run
through all normal human ranges, they tend more frequently toward duskier
hues.
Gnomes frequently have large facial features that stand out by human
standards.  Large noses or ears and, of course, their big eyes, making
them look a bit unusual by human standards.  Gnomes are typically not
what a human would term cute, though there are plenty of gnomes that do
look very much like simple, short humans.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Gnome@n

Gnomes are considered to be small, industrious workers and are known to
produce excellent spell-casters.  In temperament they are indeed
industrious as well as curious.  They tend to have an innate curiosity
about how things work and want to disassemble, study and reassemble
anything that can be taken apart, fixed or improved.  It is this
curiosity, coupled with their tendency to study the most minute details
to death, that has lead to the fame of many a gnome wizard or inventor.

Gnomes are most comfortable living in an underground city or burrow, or in
a small home on a rolling hill in some bucolic country setting.  In the
past, most gnomes lived around their great underground city of Orlumber
and conducted trade with humans in both Pennan and Narak and the dwarves
of Kha-da.  Since the destruction of Orlumber by vyans the gnomes have
moved to wherever the manage to feel comfortable.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Sharing a number of traits with them, gnomes tend to get along best with
dwarves and mix well in settings suited to both races, though not without
the occasional misunderstanding or cross-cultural problem.

To gnomes, the elves are a complete mystery.  Elven behavior is
considered inexplicable, mystifying and frustrating to most gnomes. 
Their most redeeming quality is the fact that they typically serve the
light, and thus, oppose those races that most often like to prey on
gnomes.

Gnomes have an even less positive contact with vyans, the dark elves, who
in past times have appeared out of nowhere to ravage and destroy the
works of the gnomes (including Orlumber).

Orcs, ogres, trolls and goblins come just behind vyans on the gnomes'
list of least favorite peoples.  Gnomes have a particular distaste for
goblins and categorically deny all claims that there is any similarity
between the two races.

Much like elves, gnomes are hard-pressed to understand the motives of
lizardfolk thus the dealings between the two races are infrequent and
cautious.

Having insinuated themselves into human culture, gnomes have managed to
come to an easy peace with most humans and deal well with them.  After
all, humans travel wide and far and often manage to bring back
information and interesting things that gnomes just love to study.~

0 0 10 Goblins~
.@GAverage Statistics for Goblins@n

Height: males and females about 3'6" - 4'4"

Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.
      When they do have hair it is usually black or brown and is
      usually caked in muck and filth.  Goblins have no facial hair.

Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are usually
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of
      dark brown, reddish brown, or a muddy-amber color.  The iris 
      extends to the edge of the eye with a pupil that dilates between
      a pinprick in size to large circle as lighting permits.

Affiliation: goblins are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic
neutral alignments only.

Appearance: goblins have wrinkled, craggy skin or smooth, greasy skin in
colors of greens and browns or patchy/mottled earth tone mixes.  Though
they have fewer warts and protuberances than orcs, ogres and trolls, they
are not completely free of them as a race.  Goblins tend to have sharp
teeth, though they are small and would not be called fangs by any
stretch of the imagination.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Goblin@n

Goblins are a tough and wily breed known for their extreme tolerance of
situations that would drive out most other races.  Their resistance to
disease and infection as well as their tendency to reproduce in great
numbers make them about as impossible to be rid of as cockroaches.  Most
often the truth of the matter is that the larger races goblins hang
around are better at digging out tunnels and caves and cast off more than
ample resources to provide goblins with all they need to survive. 
Unfortunately for the larger races this means that the goblins also have
free time to explore and be a general nuisance.

Goblins really could care less about wasting time on hygiene and actually
enjoy the feel of cool, slimy muck squishing between toes, fingers and
any other joint.  Their greatest joys in life are exploring everywhere,
everything, and gathering as many things as they can.  To most other
races this comes across as intrusion and theft, however, the goblins seem
to be one of the few peoples who truly understand and are happy with the
rule stating that possession is 9/10ths of the law.
Though goblins have pervaded everywhere there are generally only two
varieties to be found.  The more common is the typical small, smelly
green goblin.  The rarer white goblin is found only in the northern Cairn
mountains and have a tendency to be a bit larger and more organized than
their smaller cousins.  Though more organized, the white goblins seem to
be more like small orcs and tend to make poor spell casters.  Of the two
varieties, green goblins tend to make the better thieves and explorers
while white goblins tend to make better warriors and know how to dig in
and occupy an area.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Goblins are a very communal people and love to chatter away at each
other, though much of the conversation usually consists of "mine, mine,
mine!" 

Trolls and ogres are considered dangerous and insufferable because they
tend to use their superior size and strength to boss around the goblins. 
The only thing that makes being near them tolerable is the sheer amount
of useful goods they leave just lying around or cast off.

Orcs as bad as ogres and trolls, only what they lack in comparative
strength they make up for in organization and intellect.  Fortunately any
goblin can point out just why goblins are still the superior intelligence
of the four races.

Goblins will avoid dwarves when possible due to a long-standing dwarven
crusade to destroy all goblins.  Unfortunately they are all too good at
that task as goblins have learned.  Dwarves are the goblins most hated of
all races and any jab they can inflict on the race is worth getting in.

Elves are almost as bad as dwarves, though if it has been amply
demonstrated that if you leave them alone they will usually leave you
alone.

Vyans are an odd lot and, for those interested in attempting to wheedle
it out of them, are an excellent source one can learn magic from. 
Everything an elf could be is brought forth in what the vyans are. 
Unfortunately it also comes at the price of more insufferably bullying,
and with their swords and magic the vyans are quick to back up any
threats.  Still, they make excellent allies.

Gnomes, strangely, are a puzzle to goblins who figure that somehow the
races must be related, with gnomes the lesser relation in need of goblin
help, of course.  Why gnomes can't seem to learn to take orders and
continue to associate with races like dwarves is a source of constant
frustration to the goblins who would desperately like a new ally (or,
better yet, someone they could actually bully around).

Humans are a source of never-ending amazement, so long as you don't hang
out with the goody-goody ones that just want to kill you.  They build
dwellings almost everywhere, travel more than any other race and return
with so many neat things for goblins to appropriate.  Not to mention they
make the most amusing faces when they are forced to deal with goblins.

Halflings, as far as goblins are concerned, are just another race of
humans only shorter and more likely to be easier to boss around. 
Unfortunately they aren't quite as productive when it comes to
travelling and acquiring new things for goblins to appropriate.

Ents are a bit of a mystery.  They may look a bit like trolls but they
are neither as blatantly hostile nor as pleasing to the eye.  No slime,
no warts, and their skin almost looks more like bark than the nice
texture common to trolls.  Fortunately they do have the most interesting
responses when you uproot small plants or set larger ones on fire.~

dangerous than its zombie counterpart.  Like its lesser zombie form, it
is slave to the caster's will, remains under the casters control only so
long as his or her power infuses it, and it is unable to heal from its
wounds.  This is an evil spell, favored generally by those to whom
involvement with the dead is no great moral quandary.

0 0 7 Gzarth~
.@RGzarth@n - God of Stealth and cunning

Lurking in the deep shadows of the world above, or in the dark tunnels
and caverns of the underground, Gzarth is rarely seen and never heard,
especially not by his prey.  A flashing blade is often their last sight,
or the sudden pain of steel between the ribs or shoulder blades.  He is
the dark god of stealth, cunning, and even assassination, and as such,
holds a special place in his black heart for the goblins of the realm,
their stealth and cunning suiting his unknown purposes well.  Many
followers of the night who hold stealth and silence above raw power also
hold him in high regard.

Of all the light races, those who pay reverence to Gzarth dislike the
followers of Sindla, the god of luck the most.  The opposing god's
talents and tendencies towards luck and curiosity extend to his
followers, often enabling them to stumble across a thief or assassin
doing Gzarth's will inadvertently, spoiling their element of surprise. 
They especially dislike the gnomes, whose mechanical contraptions tend to
make a lot of noise, disrupting the silence they seek, though such noise
often provides a welcome distraction...

When coming forth before his followers as an omen, Gzarth often appears
in his natural form, that of a four foot tall, spindly goblin, cloaked in
a dark robe and shadows.  This goblin has dark green skin, enabling him
to blend easily into the background, and he always carries a long, wavy
bladed knife.  He likes to appear by stepping forth from the shadows, or
appearing from nowhere, emphasizing his stealth abilities, and he is at
times accompanied by a large dire wolf, his mount and companion.  His
symbol is that of a dull iron dagger, its blade blackened by dried on
blood.~

.@GAverage Statistics for Half-Elves@n

Height: males about 4'8"-5'10'
        females about 4'6"-5'8"

Hair: Ranging in colors usally tending towards lighter colors, but a few with
      black hair have been seen. Half-elves also tend to have little to no
      facial hair

Eyes: Primarily Blue, Green or (rarely) Gray iris. A few Half-Elves also have
      the almond shaped eyes of the elves.

Affiliation: light or dark based on alignment / how you role-play it.

Appearance: Half-elves always appear more human than elven or vyan.  Though
neither as tall nor as muscular as humans, half-elves have sturdy frames.
Their hair, skin and eyes comes in a variety of different shades, depending
upon the dominant features of their parents.  A half-elf has slightly
less pronounced pointed ears but can manage a full beard, unlike those of
elven blood.  The skin tones of most half-elves is a slightly golden color,
though this can vary depending upon their human blood.

@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Half-Elf@n

Half-Elves are as the name implies the offspring of a human and an elf or vyan.
As such they are shunned by all most all other races. They are nomadic in
nature rarely staying in one town long. Many Half-Elves have been killed by
other races who fear them saying they are an abomination as mixed breeds. 
Those who make it past adolsence have had to learned to be independant,
trusting no one in order to survive.

0 0 10 Halflings~
.@GAverage Statistics for Halflings@n

Height: males about 3'2" - 4'
        females about 3'2" - 3'10"

Hair: Mostly shades of brown, some blond or red, rarely black.
      Facial hair is rare at best.

Eyes: Tending towards all natural human shades.

Affiliation: Halflings are a light race and are restricted to good alignment.

Appearance: Halflings look quite like human children until they reach
maturity.  They do develop wrinkles, graying hair and other human
attributes, only they retain their shorter stature.  Halflings most often
develop a stout build, some say due to the minimum of 5 meals a day they
tend to enjoy as opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend.  For
those with prior role playing experience; halflings are not hobbits.  We
aren't going to ban you for having hairy feet, but realize, it is not the
norm.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Halfling@n

Halflings are typically good natured, care-free folk who are more
interested in settling down and enjoying life rather than adventuring. 
Since the idea of the game is to adventure, this means you are most
probably playing a halfling that is not quite that normal.  A normal
"adventuring" halfling is one who still values the good things in life:
good meals, good company, and cheerful surroundings.  Halflings are so
steeped in the realm of light and goodness (they can be no alignment but
good) that they tend to brighten any place they can go with a desire to
bring simple goodness with them.
The ideal adventure for your typical non-adventuring halfling would be
settingling down with friends in a nice tavern to tell tales and discuss
adventures while sharing food and drink.  Your average adventuring
halfling, while finding the same pursuit equally exciting, tends to want
to go see these places for themselves as well as talk about them.

@yRacial Relations:@n
Halflings, though typically shy around non-halflings, are found quite
frequently among dwarven and human settlements having insinuated
themselves quite merrily into both cultures.

Halflings tend to view elves with some awe, seeing in them their goodness
and ethereal beauty.  The fact that elves treat halflings as cheerful
little icons of goodness doesn't hurt either.  Halflings view ents in
much the same manner.

Gnomes are viewed as distant cousins as many of the same living
environments have been shared over time and few quarrels have resulted
over it.

Halflings detest goblins and orcs, the former race being nothing more
than a disruptive nuisance and the latter treating them no better than
they tend to treat goblin slaves.  Confrontations between these races
tends to be short and bloody.  Vyans are also grouped into this category.

Ogres tend to avoid halflings as the small race tends to annoy the large,
slow ogres.

Halflings tend to avoid trolls, as they look like a nice feast to most
trolls.

Lizardfolk are viewed with as a curiosity, halflings having rare contact
with them and no basis for understanding the culture at all.~

.~

0 0 7 Halina~
.@BHalina@n - Goddess of Charity and Life.

Halina is known among those of good heart as being the matron mother of
all races.  She is known as the "Celestial Midwife" or the Goddess of
Charity and Life, with the birth of new life being seen as the greatest
act of charity and giving of all.  Most small towns and villages will at
least have a shrine acknowledging her, to bless their village with
fertility and protection.  To this ends, many of her followers are
midwives, or almost anyone else with a calling and interest in life and
life magic, and consist of a smattering of the light races.

To Halina, the importance of life, birth, and protection are so great,
that she has made herself many enemies among the gods of darkness.  In
particular, followers of the unholy trinity of death, disease, and the
undead all loathe her and her follower's interests in protection and
healing magic.  To those who worship Halina, that healing power and
protection is the greatest gift against just such enemies of darkness.

Though she is not rumoured to appear often, it is said that she watches
over every birth of a newborn child.  Twins and triplets are said to be a
special blessing of the goddess, and those who pay her reverence are said
to live long and healthy lives.  When she does appear, it is said that
she does so in the form of a priestess, usually human, wearing long white
robes, or as a midwife that arrives in town unexpectedly to assist in a
birth where no skilled midwife was present, and vanished just as quickly
afterwards.  Her symbol is that of a simple wooden ankh, the symbol of
life and protection for all who follow her ways.~

0 0 7 Hamaskus~
.@YHamaskus@n - God of Time, Knowledge, and all learning.

While Tairae could be thought of as being the god of white magic, and
Khalmor perhaps as the necromantic god of the black, Hamaskus is the god
of neither, both, and all that lies in-between.  He is the keeper of the
scrolls of the Gods, recording knowledge, and controlling the flow of
time with an enormous water clock, which is rumoured, to have been
constructed for him by Duroth.  His principle worshippers are the
learned, both scholars and their students from the races of light or
darkness, who have an interest in the keepings of time, knowledge, and
learning.

Though Hamaskus has no real enemies among the other gods, he has few
friends.  The main oppositions to his works and those of his followers
are those who would seek to destroy them, simply because they are not
educated enough to understand them.  The followers of Ghnomb, for
example, who would seek to eat his books, claiming they gain knowledge
from doing so, or those of Ragezer who would just smash his books in a
random act of boredom and violence.

He is said never to appear in the mortal realms, constantly scribing
notes for his works, but his priests describe him as being an ancient,
grey-bearded man, wearing voluminous robes and sitting at a heavy oak
desk.  He has never in their legends once left his post, but it is
rumoured that when times of world threatening trouble come, he will come
to the earth and use his magic to set things back to their natural flow. 
His emblem is that of an open book, banded in blue, with an hourglass
emblazoned on the left hand page, and several paragraphs of illegible
script on the right.~

.@CDESCRIPTION@n

The folks of Kha-da and its out lying settlements have lately been troubled
by marauding giants.  Huge, brown-haired hill giants, dressed only in
loincloths, ambush caravans, plunder small villages and generally destroy
things.  The dwarves are massing to destroy them, though, so far, their
efforts have had minimal affect; the giants simply retreat to their lair
and close the massive boulder behind them.  Many treasure-hunting thieves
have ventured into the lair after the spoils of the raiding giants, though

famous for legendary monsters as well as wandering thieves and cutthroats.

Hobgoblin Outpost (Level 15):

Somewhere off the end of the Greened Way lies a once abandoned guard
outpost, now taken over by a fiercely xenophobic tribe of hobgoblins. 
Larger than their cousins, the goblins, these creatures are about similar
in height to humans but are considerably heavier.  Not known to raid
towns, the hobgoblins are, however, famous for their cruelty and torture
of those unfortunate enough to stumble into their lair.  Those who
consider venturing into the outpost are advised to proceed with caution
as the hobgoblins boast very capable warriors, as well as magical aid
from their incantrix.

The Silent Pines (Level 15):

South of the Greened Way lies a thick cluster of pine trees.  Tales of
great danger and mystery surround this area, which some say is draped
with gauze-like webs.  Those who have explored this region swear that the
pines themselves are sentient and resentful towards intruders.

@GOptional Advice for Role Playing a Human@n

This is basically the essence of role playing in a nutshell.  You created
your character, gave them form with statistics (the numbers that define
your strength and wisdom, dexterity and heartiness), and determined what
your occupation in this life will be.  Now it is time to breathe life
into this character.  Not just by stepping forth and killing anything
that gets in your way (though if you choose to do this is certainly
your choice), but by figuring out what this persona you've created is
like.
Are they exactly like you?  Or are they braver or more timid than you? 
What is their favorite food?  What do they like to do when they aren't
saving the world from the invading forces of darkness (or wreaking havoc
upon the weak-minded fools if you are evil).  Think of all these things
and what your character would be like if you met them.  Now try and
portray these things by your actions and words.
Want to impress someone with your role playing savvy?  Don't just walk up
and say "lets go kill some ants", unless of course you already know them
and are in a hurry, rather consider what you might really do.  If you ran
into a total stranger in the real world dressed as a priest, would you
greet him/her the same way you would greet a total stranger wearing a
full military outfit?  Would you just walk up to a complete stranger in a
nun's habit and say "Hey, want to go shoot some hoops at the local gym"? 
(If you answered yes to either of these, you might wish to seek
counseling).  In most cases the answer should be no.  Neither would most
characters do that.  How would you're character handle the situation? 
That's the basic essence of role playing.
Create not just a character, but a personality to go with it.  Then take
that personality and play it.  Do it consistently and you'll find
situations begin to arise that you have to muddle through and you'll see
your character evolving.
Now, if you're just looking for a good hack-and-slash environment we can
offer that too.  Just head right out and find the nearest things to kill. 
I'd advise using the consider command frequently in either case.  Its
also a pretty bad idea to start killing townsfolk as the guards in town
are a bit touchy about that sort of thing.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Humans have perhaps the greatest chance to meet and greet all the races
as a race for they, among all the races present on Legacy's Dawning have the greatest
variance of alignment and tendency to be good or evil.

Humans get along best with halflings and gnomes having shared close
living space with them for some time.

Humans get along fairly well with dwarves and lizardfolk, though do not
profess to understand them overly well as both other races are relatively
secluded from the human perspective.

Humans and elves only recently developed a stable relationship, having
been at war off and on in the past.  Many humans still distrust the elves
owing to so many years of ambushes, raids, and general mistrust that
developed throughout a war that very nearly destroyed the largest human
settlement, Medienne.  Throughout all this there have always been other
humans willing to trust the elves for their ethereal beauty and grace
that seems to set them above humans, even as others found these traits
alien and frightening.

Ents are considered a curiosity, sought by many as few are rarely seen. 
Soon after humans tend to lose interest in ents finding their slow,
deliberate ways too drawn out for their tastes.

Humans have peculiar dealings with orcs, with most contact between the
races occurring through dealing of a very mercenary nature.  Orcs aren't
the most cohesive of races and humans have had to deal with dozens of
various orc tribes whose only constant factor has been a tendency towards
brutish strength and barbaric vulgarity from a human perspective. 
Despite these social faux pas, orcs have been considered both allies and
enemies from time to time.

Likewise, humans have had similar dealings with ogres.  While ogres are
typically considered more dangerous and more predictable only because you
can only count on two things (that an ogre will be bigger than you are
and more disagreeable) humans have, on occasion, hired ogres as guards or
workers when their appetites for violence and food can be sated.

Humans tend to avoid trolls and goblins, finding the former race too
ready to eat humans regardless of how you handle them and the latter
race too capricious and filthy to be trusted.  In either case the races
are best avoided or pushed elsewhere to let others deal with them.

Vyans, primarily because they look so much like elves, are treated with
the same cautiousness if at all.  Typically only humans steeped in the
darker aspects of evil culture have any dealing at all with vyans.  Those
humans that lean towards the light not only distrust the vyans for their
elf-like appearance, but more so for the utter acts of evil purported to
be their doings.~

dwarves mined copper and iron the veins going deep into the earth.  Some

.Nestled against the southern peaks of the Everwinter range, Icefinger
Woods was named by the first humans who encountered the aloof tribe of
wood elves living amongst the trees.  The elves called the woods
Il'fanidin, which roughly translates into 'woods at the edge of the great
ice'.  Some hundred years later, unexplained changes began to grip the
woods; the forest's heart became dark and twisted, and the ancient trees
became draped with web and tangling vines.  What became of the wood elves
no one knows, and those who dared enter the woods disappeared; rarely, a
desicated husk would be found upon the roadway, but most often nothing
was seen again of the hapless adventurers.

might have settled to the south of Sos-Kul where they were driven.~

.~

16 0 0 Imm Policies~
.@CCommon Sense@n
If you are reading this, you should know intuitively what you should and
should not do.  No dispensing of untoward favors, giving out items,
information, using your immortal status to help others, etc.  If you have
a question about whether you may or may not do something *ask beforehand*.

@CPlayer Assistance@n 
Player assistance is only to be give by Imms level 94 and over.  Imms
below 94 should keep player interaction at a minimum, and try to remain
invis to players.  Apprentices (level 92) should always remain invisible,
and should have no interaction save in emergency situations.  Those
qualified to do approvals may do so should no avatars be present.

Player assistance is only allowed for players at or lower than level 2. 
The types of assistance you may give are giving food or drink when they
are starving or thirsty, removing the plague, sending them to a safe town
if they have locked themselves in a very aggressive area, etc.  You may
NOT load equipment for the player or give him items other than the basic
necessities for his problem.

@CPlayer Reimbursement@n
Player reimbursement can only be given by Imms level 93 or higher.  No
reimbursments may be given to players whom an imm knows in real life. 
Player reimbursements are only given if they lost their equipment
directly due to a MUD bug.  They will only be reimbursed for equipment in
their backup files.  Backups are made every couple days, so they could
have lost equipment that they gained in the last day or two.  At the same
time, they might gain equipment that broke in battle, etc.  We do not
reimburse due to crashes or lag.  Equipment on corpses 'created'
immediately before crashes will reappear on the body when the mud returns.

@CPlayer Renaming@n
All imms and avatars may politely ask players to change their names.  If
a player insists on keeping it, only a level 93 or higher may force him
to change it.

Players are asked to pick names that fit both their character and the
medieval time period.  If the player's name does not meet these
requirements, we will politely ask them to pick a more fitting name.
If a player is below level 3, only insist that they change the name if it
is extremely offensive or inappropriate.  i.e.  Dickhead or Mickey Mouse 
Otherwise, let the player experience the mud for a couple of levels.  If
he stays to level 3, then politely ask him to change his name.

The same type of interaction applies to interactions regarding player
approvals.  Players who are not responsive to avatar requests should be
referred to a high level immortal.
@CPenalties@n
Penalties for violation of policies are as follows: 

1st time:  warning, level loss, possible purge
2nd time:  automatic level loss, possible purge
3rd time:  automatic purge

Punishment is at the discretion of the senior Imms.

@CImmortal Identities@n
If you play a mortal, keep things separate.  Do @CNOT@n give out your
identity, and let players find out that character X is played by an
immortal.  Fairness is critical for the mud, and any appearance of
favoritism or impropriety is damaging.  Extremely so.  This cannot be
emphasized too much.  (Also remember that you are an imm first now and a
player second.) 

@CArea Design@n
Before an area can be created, it must be approved by the building
immortal.  Please send her a description of the area, why it exists, what
types of mobs will be there, etc.  If it doesn't have a rationale don't
waste your time building.  Themes are important.

@CArea Opening@n
Before an area can be opened it must be checked by at least one other .
Send a request for review to the building immortal.  It may not be opened
until it has passed a final review.

@CPlayer Interaction@n
As previously stated, apprentices (level 92's) do not exist as far as
players are concerned.  All other imms may be visible at their own
discretion.  They are expected to be courteous to all mortals, but should
provide no assistance other then that described above.  Immortals should
not load ANY items for mortals, no matter how innocuous, except during bug
reimbursements as described above.  Immortals obviously should not join
clans or participate in other mortal activities.  Participation in OOC
activities should be limited to keep immortals from seeming too mortal. 
This type of interaction, of course, may be done by mortal alternates.

@CImmortal Knowledge@n
Immortals are expected not to use their powers to gain knowledge
useful in day-to-day playing.  Area authors are expected not to take
leadership roles in groups in their own areas, so as not to reveal any
secrets.  Those immortals who, through the course of routine work, become
privy to information not available to players, are required to keep this
to themselves.  Those abusing their powers will be dealt with by an
appropriate immortal.~

.~

0 0 0 Immortal_apply~
.@YApplying for an immortal position:@n

The position you will be applying for is Apprentice, where you will help
other immortals build and maintain areas, as well as build your own area.

@ySTEP ONE:@n
Mudmail to Guin a short description of an area idea.  Remember that
the theme of this mud is medieval fantasy, though possibly more fantasy.
Include in your mudmail, which should be no more than 60 lines, some sample
room descriptions in your area.

@ySTEP TWO:@n
If your application is intriguing and your writing ability adequate, you
will likely be asked to submit a longer application via email and
possibly asked to Avatar for a trial period.

@yNOTE:@n
An immortal position is NOT an invitation to party and otherwise goof
off.  You are applying to work.  Moreover, you will be logged and of
course, any immortal found cheating will be deleted and their mortal
likely banned for a period, if not forever.

In return, you have the opportunity to see your work and creations come to
life and entertain the masses.  You will aid in Legacy's Dawning's course
and design.  You will be not only a creator of the realm but also its
protector.~

.HOW TO MAKE GOOD QUESTS


A.) A Bill of Player's Rights
Perhaps the most important point about designing quests is to think as a
player and not as a designer, the least a playerdeserves is: 

a1) Not to be killed without warning
a2)Not to be given horribly unclear hints.
a3) To be able to win without the experience of past lives
a4) To be able to win without knowledge of future events
a5) Not to have the game closed off without warning, i.e.  no one way
dead ends 
a6) Not to need to do unlikely things
a7) Not to need to do boring things for the sake of it , i.e.  lets make
sense 
a8) Not to have to type exactly the right verb
a9) To be allowed reasonable synonyms
a10) To have reasonable freedom of action
a11) Not to have to depend on luck
a12) To be able to understand a problem once it is solved
a13) Not to be given too many red herrings 
a14) To have a good reason why something is impossible
a15)  Not to need to be American to understand hints
a16) To know how the game is getting on~

0 0 7 Iniara~
.@RIniara@n - Goddess of Pain and Revenge, Mother of Darkness.

The brilliance of light must always be balanced by the black of night,
and within this darkness, seething shadows lie in wait.  This realm of
seductive shadows is the favoured abode of Iniara, the Queen of Pain. 
Known to her children, predominantly members of the Vyan race, as the
Dark Mother, Iniara is revered as the matriarch of pain and suffering,
and indeed, many of her Priestesses (for few males ever rise to positions
of high power in her service) bear the marks of ritual scarring all over
their bodies.  Iniara's followers tend to be those who seek to learn from
the moments of ecstasy found only at the height of the most exquisite
pain, and as such, tend to seek out many wild experiences to gather the
wisdom and insights that they can learn from these exotic sensations.

Iniara's devotees are feared by many, both by those who walk in sunlight
and by those following the call of the shadows, as the wild revels held
by her worshippers rarely end without the sacrifice of some intelligent
being, usually by the most exquisitely painful (and therefore the most
spiritually enlightening) method possible.  The elves in particular are
seen as anathema, and are favoured victims for the sacrificial rituals,
as the Vyans find it amusing to see just how much pain they can inflict
upon the fragile elf before it succumbs to the dark embrace of Khalmor. 
Followers of the Dark Mother seek to wreak their revenge upon anything
and everything that they feel has done them wrong, sometimes merely on
the slightest of whims.

Those among her priesthood who have seen manifestations of Iniara claim
she appears as either a darkly beautiful temptress of the Vyan race, with
cold skin the colour of obsidian and eyes the translucent grey of morning
mist, clad mainly in her long, silvery curls, or as an equally beautiful
Vyan matron, heavily pregnant, bearing the ritual scars, brands and
tattoos of a high priestess all over her body.  Even those Vyans who
patronize deities other than she hold a place in their heart for this
Queen of Pain, whom all recognize as the mother of their race.  Her
symbol is a vicious looking scourge, wreathed in flames, with a single
drop of blood dangling from one wickedly barbed lash.~

@CPARAMENTERS@n:

char is the pointer to the character being tested
int is how many moves are required for the action
@Ideducts those moves when that action is done. Can be used
@Ito simulate a climb taking moves.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Tests to see if char has greater than or equal to moves than int.  If
true, returns FALSE.  If false, returns TRUE.
In the TRUE case, it also sends to the char: You are too exhausted.
In the FALSE case, it also deducts int from char's moves.~

.@CWeapons/Armor Race and Class Restrictions@n

Currently, we're debating the idea of denying the big races access to
small items like daggers, small sheilds, etc.  Big races would then have
to rely on items like whips for off_hand...  or possibly shortswords and
hand axes, if we can set up a 'big.off.hand' oflag.  Your thoughts are
welcome.

Removes char from existence.  If char points to a character other than a
mob, it will do nothing.

Removes an object from the game.  The number is optional but if not
specified it will junk all of that type whereever it is.  So normal usage
is junk_obj( obj, 1 ).~

0 0 14 Keywords~
.@CSYNTAX@n

@Gkeyword <list of words>@n : set your keywords (no commas)

@CDESCRIPTION@n

This command is used to set the words which the player can be referenced
by.  They are only checked if the player is unrecognized and thus should
not include the player's name.  See help @Cappearance@n for more detail.
Players should give themselves at least @cfour@n or @cfive@n keywords to avoid
confusion.  Keywords should include your race and everything in your
appearance, except prepositions and conjunctions.  Keywords should not be
separated by commas, just spaces.

@CEXAMPLE@n

@CKeyword slim elf hazel eyes@n

That would set the keywords for an elf mage whose description and
appearance describe him or her as 'a slim elf with hazel eyes.' Pretty
straightforward, eh?

@CAny unique keywords must be taken from your description, or from an IC
characteristic of your character.  Anachronistic words will not be
approved.@n~

0 0 7 Khalmor~
.@RKhalmor@n - God of the Dead.

Reigning supreme in the black depths of the Abyss, Khalmor is the god of
the dead.  Though simply sending both good and evil souls to their
rightful places in the afterlife is not an evil act in its own, what
makes Khalmor evil is his recent trend towards wanting to increase the
influx of souls entering his domain.  In doing such, the Ebon Triumvirate
of himself, Taraskatt, and Xharax have done much in attempts to bring
death and war to the lands.

His personal tasks of sending each soul to its rightful place is always
done perfectly, he sends no soul to a place other than where it truly
deserves to be.  He does, however, seek to reign over more souls.  The
greatest servants in his quest to these ends are the holy crusaders of
darkness, whose strength and courage help him defeat his foes.  His
greatest enemies, of course, are the equally chivalrous followers of
Chandros.  Their diametrical struggle between holy and unholy might is
one that shall not be resolved without battle to the death, in which
case, no matter who the victor is, Khalmor has claimed more souls in his
domain.

When Khalmor appears it is often as a living pillar of unholy fire,
radiating an aura of fear to all that see him.  His other main form is
that of a warrior in spiked armour, completely blackened by fire with
burning red eyes that are the only indication that anything lives inside
the suit.  The crest on the warriors shield is that of an inverted sun,
completely black, sinking into a sea of blood, a cruel mockery of the
symbol of Chandros.  This also serves to be his personal symbol, a
constant mark against Chandros' pride.~

.~

0 0 7 Khephera~
.@YKhephera@n - Goddess of Song, dance and spirits of air.

Wherever a woodlark lifts its voice in sweet song, wherever a child
dances to a tune heard in the chaos of her mind, wherever a merry breeze
skips to the lyrical melody of the seasons, there is Khephera.  The Lady
of Music, patronized by many bards and lovers of fine song, is a
capricious deity, her actions often seeming as random as the notes of a
melody, or the dance of the wind through the treetops.  Her followers are
a merry lot, eternally dancing through the endless song of life and death
woven throughout the ages.  Detractors of her religion call the devotees
of Khephera vain and hedonistic, too caught up in their melodies to take
notice of the world around them, though the songsters seem not to care,
preferring instead to turn to their own labyrinth of music.

Khephera's worshippers are a very diverse lot, not restricted to any
particular race.  Music-lovers are found among both the light and the
dark races, and as such, Khephera's followers are many.  Most of her
priesthood are skilled with at least one instrument, and many are adept
at playing several, ranging from lyres and lutes to panpipes and
percussion instruments.  Khephera has no true enemies; those that invoke
her wrath usually find themselves the victim of some cruel (albeit
accurate) satire, and hastily repent their wrongs against her.  Most
bards and minstrels credit the Lady of Music as the inspiration for their
works, and she is said to patronize any gathering where song, dance and
gaiety are prevalent.

Khephera takes a very active role in the mortal world, appearing often to
her followers.  Their descriptions of her are as varied as the colours of
the sunset, as each individual tends to see that which is most beautiful
in his or her eyes.  The most consistent of her appearances is a pale
human beauty, with hair black as a raven's wing.  Her eyes, no matter
what the rest of her manifestation may look like, remain always the same;
lacking both white and pupil, they appear to be merely fields of stars on
a velvet black sky.  Khephera's symbol is that of a silver poet's lyre, a
single red rose entwined among its gilded strings.  Anywhere the wind
goes, there she is, for her fingers are the wind, and the wind her
fingers, while all space is the smile of her.~

0 0 19 Kobolds~
.A race of small humanoids with dog-like heads, the kobolds are a major
nuisance to the dwarves.  The vile little creatures breed and grow at an
obnoxious rate, providing a nearly limitless army of adversaries for any
who try to dwell in the northern mountains.  A kobold den of significant
size exists somewhat to the west of the dwarven citidel of Kha-Da. 
Travellers in the area are advised to use caution as these kobolds are
rumored to be better equipped and trained than most.  If you plan on
touring the northern mountains, it might be wise to talk to a few dwarves
first and find out what you can about the kobolds first, just in case you
should come across them.~

.A poor lost soul has stumbled across a powerful item, an artifact which
was never meant to be touched by human hands.  The power of magick of the
artifact, the ethergem, drove the man to madness, and he began using the
power of the gem to create a portal to the ethereal plane from out own
world.  Once He had found his way across the dimensional barrier, his
madness only grew worse.  Coming to another great barrier, that of the
ends of the ethereal plane itself, he summoned hordes of terrible efreets
to guard him as he worked on a way to break down the final barrier.
 
In the five hundred years since his sanity left him, he has not found a
way to cross the final threshhold into the unknown beyond.
 
Nor has he given up his mad quest.
 
In the end, should he succeed, the poor madman could possibly destroy the

important in its use as a scout and confidant.  A mage may @Gswitch@n to

0 0 1 Lichdom~
.The ultimate goal in a sorcerer's quest for power, the spell of lichdom
transforms their puny flesh into the glorious form of a lich.  The
weakness of life rolls away, replaced by the burning energy of undying
evil.  The path to lichdom is not easy even for a true devotee of the
dark gods.  Many unique items and incantations must be assembled and the
evil gods must grant their humbled servant this one request.  In the form
of a lich, a sorcerer quickly regains staggering amounts of magical
energies.  It goes without saying that such a powerful evil will find
little welcome in all but the darkest townships across the lands.

churning the soft rock into stone sculptures and twisted pillars.  Some

@CDESCRIPTION@n

@I List gives you a table of all the objects a shopkeeper has, and their
respective costs, levels, number, and condition.  The cost is always
listed in copper pieces, and is based on the @Evalue@n of the object and
how many are in stock.  The level is the minimum level needed to use the
object, and is often low, although the more powerful items tend to have
high levels.

@I The number is the amount of a particular item that the shopkeeper
currently has.  As it varies, the amount that the item is sold for varies
as well; the more items he has, the less they will cost, and the less
items he has, the more they will cost.

@I The condition tells the status of the object.  A @Eshop@n always sells
items in excellent condition, unless an item in need of @Erepair@n has
been sold to it by a player.

@I If an argument is specified it uses the same input as buy so it can be
used to verify you are buying what you think you are.  Thus to see a list
of all shields in a shop you would use list all.shield.

@I*** in the level portion of the list means that either your race,
class, or alignment forbids your use of the item.~

0 0 10 Lizardmen Lizardfolk~
.@GAverage Statistics for Lizardfolk@n

Height: male and female 5'6" - 6'2"

Hair: (you're kidding right?) Lizardfolk don't grow hair.

Eyes: Reptilian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.

Affiliation: A neutral race which is restricted to neutral alignment.

Appearance: Lacking hair for a description, lizardfolk often employ the
description of various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the way a
snake's scales form interesting patterns, many lizardfolk also develop
patterns.  Most often patterns are recurrent in clan members and are the
primary identifying mark of a particular tribe, clan or familial group of
lizardfolk.  Lizardfolk skin/scales are typically soft and smooth like a
snakes, though wet, fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been
noted before as well.

Lizardfolk have sharp claws that sometimes make grasping and manipulation
a little difficult, but which prove quite useful in unarmed combat. 
Lizardfolk are also lacking lips and can not whistle and must improvise
when calling pets.

Lizardfolk, as a whole, live solely in regions of swampland.  Serpentmen,
a distant relative, tend to prefer the more arid desert climates. 
Lizardmen are not serpentmen, there is a difference.


@GOption Advice for Role Playing Lizardfolk@n

Lizardfolk are typically a fierce yet contemplative people who are
withdrawn in dealings with any other race then their own.  They prefer
the solitude of their own kind whenever possible, but will work alongside
others in times of need.  Within almost every lizardperson a war is raged
at all times between the hot-headed violent nature of brute survival
against the contemplative wisdom of peace.  Most often it is the youths
who are the fighters and warriors of a tribe, their easy anger reigned in
by the wiser, older lizardfolk who act as elder guides.  It is with time
and age that true wisdom and peace are acquired, quenching the rage
within though never stilling the fierce strength that came with it.

Lizardfolk come from a tribal background where many small tribes fought
with each other over territory.  It was not until two tribes managed to
absorb many others and, after a fierce struggle, finally came to terms
with each other and joined as one large clan that their only city of
Sos-kul was built in the Kissk swamp.  Though most have formed into one
homogenized clan, the scale-markings that typically identified various
tribes and familial groups are still pretty pure and a developing caste
system indicates that they will remain distinguishing characteristics for
some time yet.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Lizardfolk are generally a reclusive race preferring to stick to their own
kind.  Despite their misgivings, however, they have come to find that
they can get along well with humans who share the same tendency towards
the balance of light and dark.

Though contact is quite sparse, nearly being on the other side of the
known world from lizardfolk, they do get along fairly well with gnomes
when contact does occur.

Lizardfolk do not get along very well with dwarves due to several
cross-cultural differences and misunderstandings despite the faith they
both place in gnomes.

Lizardfolk do not mix well with elves at all.  Some speculate that this
stems from a past misunderstanding of temporal importance while others
argue that the conflict's roots relate to religious matters.

Lizardfolk have even less tolerance of the elves dark cousins, the vyans. 
Several wars have been fought between vyans and lizardfolk in the past.

Similarly, Lizardfolk do not get along well with orcs, ogres or trolls. 
Continued raids on lizardfolk settlements by these peoples has resulted
in a strong hatred for these races by most lizardfolk.

Lizardfolk do not tolerate the presence of goblins, considering them
nothing more than useless vermin and thieves most notable for their theft
of lizardfolk eggs which they sell to vyans to be trained as slaves when
they hatch.~

0 0 10 Llewyrr~
.  The llewyrr live in the Mighty Vaasa, which lies over a range of
mountains to the northeast of Medienna.  The Vaasa is the mightiest
forest known, and dwarfs all others in its size, age, and grandeur. 
Llewyrr tend to dress in forest colors and have straight hair running
from dark browns to blonds.  Elven eyes are always striking, and come in
more shades and varieties than even those of human.

.  The llewyrr have come to have very distinct characteristics which have
come to depict them, and them only.  Their general attitude towards life
deviates from that of many others; they believe in the sacredness that
all things: elven, human, animal, plant, rock, or soil.  Only those who
kill or destroy out of reasons other than necessity of survival are
considered lessers.  Over the years, however, there has come to be a
large generalization that all races other than elven kill needlessly and
destroy nature, and so are lessers.  Several radical factions of llewyrr
have been known to massacare humans and other nearby races for seemingly
no reason.

.  Often it is possible to tell the specific beliefs followed by a
llewyrr by the beads woven into his or her hair.  This is definately not
true for all though, as many simply choose their own path to follow.~

.@CSYNTAX@n

loop( macro ) { < statement(s) > }

@CPARAMETERS:@n

macro values are:

all_in_room    - Loops through each char/mob found in current room
followers      - Loops through each char/mob following the char
logic statement- Loops until the statement becomes false
                 (be careful not to construct an inf. loop)

@CDESCRIPTION@n:@n

The loop() function executes statement (no {}'s) or statements (needs
{}'s) for as many times as specified by macro.  The variable rch (type
pointer to char) is set each iteration of the loop to a new character.  

@CEXAMPLES:@n

loop( all_in_room )
  inflict( rch, mob, 5d8+10, "earthquake" );  // inflicts damage on all in room

loop( all_in_room ) {
  if( rch != ch ) {
    i = 4d6+0;
    dam_message( rch, i, "the fireball" );
    inflict( rch, mob, i, "fireball" );          // hurts everyone except ch
    }
  }

i = 0;
loop( i < 5 ) {
  act_tochar( "Round and Round and...", ch );
  i = add( i, 1 );
}

@CNOTE@n:

Transfer_all and loop won't work with exit/entrances triggers because the
only valid target in those triggers is ch, rch is null and there is
nothing else to check.  All <things> following <person> will kick the
trigger themselves.

.~

0 0 15 Mage~
.A mage is an individual whose intellectual curiosity leads him to ask
questions perhaps better left unconsidered.  Mages typically possess
tremendous mental abilities, and spend a great deal of time in research and
in conducting their experiments.  This generally leaves them with feeble
physical skills.  From their magical training, they learn the mystical
nature of the world around them, and having learned how to shape this
force, they bend the physical world around them to suit their whim and
will.

While mages tend to start slowly, they are important to any group because
they have such diverse effects.  Simple spells can create water, food, and
light, while more powerful spells can harness natural forces into bolts of
lightning and sheets of fire.  Protective spells, detection spells, and
spells to enhance physical abilities are all learned by a mage, and with
the additional unique and extremely useful @Cspell@n of @Cfind@n @Cfamiliar@n, a mage
is indeed a powerful class.  Mages' spells are adversely affected by metal,
and the more metal a mage wears the more difficult it is to cast spells.

To see a listing of the spells available to Mages, see the help file on
@CAbilities@n.

Other help files that may be useful include help @Cmagic@n, @Cspell@n, @Cleech@n, and

0 0 11 Magic~
.Magic in this realm is different from what you might be used to.  Reagents
are required for most all spells in addition to the appropriate gestures.
To see what spells you can learn at your level, type "abil s".  If you are
a spell-caster you should have at least one spell.  The word next to the
spell describes your profiency at casting that spell.  This will increase
the more you cast the spell.

To find out more about a particular spell, type @Cspell spell name@n.  This
will give you the lowdown on the spell, listing its reagents, description,
casting time, etc.  To find reagents for a spell, look around in the wild
or visit various shops scattered across the realms.  Some are commonplace
and widely available, and some are quite expensive and/or difficult to
find.

To cast a spell, type @b"cast <spell name> <target>".@n This requires
that you have the proper reagents in your inventory, know the spell at at
least level 1, and have enough energy to cast it.  @bEnergy@n is listed
under the prompt next to the 'e'.  It slowly regenerates up to some max
that increases with level and intelligence.  To see your current max,
type "score".  When you successful cast a spell you will begin to perform
the necessary gestures.  This can take from 1-5 turns.

For mages (and eventually other delvers in the mystical arts), the amount
of metal worn on one's body affects the casting cost of spells in terms
of energy.  This is due to how metal interferes with the magical fields
and forces necessary for the proper casting of spells.  If your spells
suddenly jump in their casting costs, check your @binventory@n; you're
most likely wearing something metal that is to blame.

When spell casters are @bbashed@n (in addition to some other commands) by
mobs or other players, a spell might be disrupted.  Beware.

Some spells are @bleech@n spells, and will remain active until you stop
feeding them energy off of your max.  Type @bleech@n and @bhelp leech@n
to find out more about this.

To find out the specific spells available to a class, type help
@EAbilities@n.  Additional help files that may be useful include
@Espell@n, and @Eleech@n.~

0 0 1 Magic Missile~
.This is probably the first, and certainly the most basic offensive spell
a young spellcaster learns.  With a great deal of concentration, the
caster uses the substance of a pebble to form a missile of pure energy,
which can then be hurled at an opponent to do some substantial damage. 
This spell is often used to train apprentices to focus their power, and
the experience gained from this can lead to more complex, powerful spells.~

The mail function uses the standard editor commands to write letters.  See
@Chelp editor@n for the list and description of these.  In addition to the
standard editor commands, mail also uses :

mail #           : either displays that letter (if not editting),
                    inserts/deletes that line. (See help editor)
mail <subject>   : begins editting new letter with subject <subject>
mail send <name> : sends the mail being editted to <name> 
mail delete      : erases the letter being editted
mail delete #    : erases that message

mail cc <name>   : sends a copy of mail being edited to <name>,
                    but you continue to edit it.
mail edit #      : copies the specified message to the mail buffer
  
@CDESCRIPTION@n

Mail is used to send a message to a specific person.  You do not have to be
introduced to that person; only their name is required to send a letter.

16 0 19 Mar Quioth~
.The crown jewel of the underground realms, Mar Quioth is the central
haven of the dark races.  The city's name translates roughly from the
Vyan tongue to 'The Realm of Shadows.' When the racial split occured on
A'lainn, the dark races wandered for many months before choosing this
place to make their homeland.  Nestled deep in the K'tathi Mountains, Mar
Quioth is nothing if not beautiful.

As the years rolled past, the Realm of Shadows grew into a sprawling
system commonly broken into six separate cities for the sake of ease. 
@cSha'rheza@n, or the Old City, is the original core of Mar Quioth, and
is the home of the wealthy and influential members of dark society.  Only
the finest merchandise is sold on these austere streets; costly prices
ensure that only the wealthy need shop here.  Sha'rheza also holds the
residence of the leader of Mar Quioth.

@cSha'darci@n, or the New City (the term new is relevant; while nowhere
near as old as Sha'rheza, the so-called 'new' city has been in existence
for several hundred years), is the merchant's quarter.  From finery to
every-day goods, something to suit every taste can be found in this
place, though the elite tend to prefer the more trendy boutiques of
Sha'rheza.  This is also where the majority of the residents of Mar
Quioth make their homes; in general, this sector is elegant, yet nowhere
near a match to Sha'rheza's grand beauty.

As rules outlining the use of magics became more and more strict, many
schools of wizardry were outlawed, and it was decreed that magics could
only be taught in crown-approved universities.  @cSha'myrsa@n, the City
of Lights, holds the oldest and finest of the schools of dark magic, and
is also home to several temples and libraries.  Many people fear the
magics constantly going on in the City of Lights, and as a result, this
quarter tends to remain rather desolate of all but the mages, their
students, and those few seeking the knowledge of the libraries or the
peace of the temples.

Every city has its poorer section, and Mar Quioth, grand though it is, is
no exception.  Commonly referred to as the Warren, @cSha'maral'dze@n, the
City of Rats, is the most notorious section of town.  This is the realm
of beggars and criminals, low lifes who haven't worked a day of their
miserable lives and don't intend to start anytime soon.  Those items
deemed too outrageous even by the relatively free and easy standards of
Mar Quioth can usually be found here, and indeed it's rumoured that
virtually anything can be bought in the Warren...for a dear price. 
Several attempts have been made to clean out this unsavory sector of the
city, but like the rats they're named after, the dealers here just have a
habit of popping back up in this maze of dark allies and shabby buildings.

Partly to deal with the pests in Sha'maral'dze, a small, carefully
selected army is maintained at all times.  These elite fighting troops
make their homes in @cSha'ke'chani@n, the City of Blood.  The best
training grounds and veteran warriors can be found here, and many young
recruits flock to this place hoping to become members of the
Ke'chan'edras, the Queen's personal guards.  This part of Mar Quioth is
rather spartan, the warriors caring more for their training and duty than
for the luxuries much of the city has to offer.

The last of the six cities of Mar Quioth is @cSha'kymor'al@n, the City of
Ships.  This is the youngest part of the Realm of Shadows, and unlike the
rest, is found on the surface world.  A healthy, if somewhat tense, trade
has been founded between Dun Tathaig and Mar Quioth, as well as the other
cities of the land.  As a result, this shantytown of social outcasts and
rabble-rousers of every sort has sprung up around the docks of
Sha'kymor'al, providing a haven for thieves and others of less than noble
professions.  Many of the nobles of Mar Quioth would prefer to pretend
that this surface city wasn't part of the Realm of Shadows at all, but
the trade is quite profitable, so this 'eyesore' is tolerated, if not
widely accepted.~

marmor                              : lists armor parts for mobile 
marmor # <chance> <ac> <part_name>  : assigns values for a body part

@CDESCRIPTION@n

.  Marmor is used to assign armor to non-humanoid monsters.  Each mobile
can have up to 5 different body parts.  For every hit on the mobile the
fight routine rolls a number from 0 to 1000.  It starts on body part 1 -
if the chance for that part is greater or equal to the roll, the hit
occurs on that body part.  If not it then compares the roll to the chance
for the next part.  Therefore the last body part should always have a
chance of 1000.  Ac is the armor value for the body part - if a hit
occurs on the given part, 0-Ac points of damage are absorbed.  For
humanoid monsters set mflag humanoid which causes a default list of body
parts to be used.  
.  Body parts with two words looks much better than just one word. 
Example: warty leg.  Don't make the area name too long.  ~

.@RMarnlee Heath@n | vnum 2300+
Creator:  Tiene
Location: North and some west of Mar Q, in the foothills of the mountain
range.

Marnlee Heath is a small agrarian village of humans and elves.  It boasts
a popular vineyard and winery, as well as some of the best cattle of the
lands.  Given more to herd animals than crop farming, this little town is
also the trade center for the local pig farm, sheep ranch and dogbreeder. 
A leatherworker settled in Marnlee Heath two generations ago, and his
descendents today own and operate one of the only tanneries that
specializes in deer, pig, and goat leathers in addition to the
traditional cowhide leathers.  Shops in the hamlet include: winery,
tannery, leathermaker, dogbreeder, sheep ranch.
                      @g------------------@n
This town shares an economic co-dependency with Ceanshire.  Marnlee
Heath's livestock farms trades hay from Ceanshire for leathers and wines. 
Ceanshire's herbalist also buys grape seeds from Marnlee Heath to use for
grapeseed oil, the basis of many distillations and essences.

262144 0 19 Medienne Cemetery/Starkadder Crypt~
.@CDESCRIPTION@n

The gate swings slowly open in a rusty screech of contempt.

A spectre rises up before you!
The spectre says, "Know this:"
@e   "The earth beyond this gate is sworn by blood to a dark power...
   "Mortals are not welcome here, except as sacrifice.
   "Enter at your peril."
@n
The Medienne Cemetery has not served its original purpose in years.  Now,
with the Starkadder Crypt lying at it's center like a black heart, the
graveyard is nothing less than an armed camp.

Though a huge, sprawling area, rumors and tales of veteran adventurers
claim that the crypt beneath the Cemetery is larger and yet more deadly
as it descends into the earth, connecting to both ancient catacombs that
predate Medienne itself, and the lair of the greatest Archimage to ever
live, Croazner the Undying.~

.~

0 0 19 Medienne Forest~
.A large expanse of woods lies between the human city of Medienne and the
Dragonspire Mountains.  It is well known for both its capacity as a good
hunting ground and its ability to lose entire parties of hunters.  If you
plan to leave the trail, be sure to bring along someone experienced in
woodlore and exploring.  For the avid hunter, the woods have produced
everything from quaint little squirrels to ferocious grizzlies.  Among
the hunters' favorites are the agile stags that populate the forest.~

.~

0 0 19 Medienne Sewer~
.@CDESCRIPTION@n

The human city of Medienne has an extensive sewer system located beneath
its streets.  Parents often threaten their misbehaving children with
scary stories of strange, dangerous beasts, such as alligators and evil
humanoid rats, that inhabit the foul-smelling sewers and will creep up
and abduct them.  How much of it is fact or fiction is not known, but
some brave (or insane) adventurers who have explored the area claim that
indeed many of the tales are true.~

0 0 8 Metals~
.@CMETALS OF THE REALM@n
  
@CCopper@n
A soft, abundant, easily mined metal, copper is cheapest coin of the
realm.
  
@CSilver@n
Soft and gleaming, silver is rarer and more valuable than copper.  One
piece of silver is worth ten pieces of copper.
 
@CGold@n
Most of the gold of the realm comes from the mines of the industrious
Dwarves of Kha-Da.  Gold is a rare, extremely heavy metal.  One piece of
gold equal ten pieces of silver.
 
@CPlatinum@n
Earlier finders of platinum condemned it as "false silver" and threw it
into the ocean.  They came to learn the value of the hard, light metal,
however.  Platinum is silver-white, is very rare, and quite expensive. 
One platinum piece equals ten pieces of gold.  While almost everlasting,
it is too soft and expensive to use in most armor.
  
@CBronze@n
Soft, malleable, and plentiful, bronze was the first metal used by
mortals for making weapons and armor.  The practice of using bronze has
not gone out of style, however, because bronze is inexpensive and easily
replaceable.  Bronze is usually impure, thus bronze weapons and armor are
inordinately heavy.  Also, because the metal is so soft, it tends to
blunt easily.  Bronze tends to be easy to enchant.
  
@CIron@n
A heavy, hard metal, iron is the most prominent material used in weapon
making.  It can be forged by even apprentice blacksmiths, and is abundant
enough to be relatively cheap.  Found deep in the earth, iron tends to be
impure, and is therefore heavy.  It does not blunt readily as bronze,
however, so consqeuently is ideal for armor and edged weapons.  Iron is
fairly easy to enchant.
  
@CSteel@n
Steel is iron which has been super-heated to boil out impurities. 
Extremely hard, steel is surprisingly light-weight.  Steel weapons will
keep their edges, and steel armor will not dent easily.  Because only
experienced blacksmiths can work with steel, it is quite expensive.  The
Dwarves generally claim to have discovered steel, as only their mighty
forges could have produced enough heat to draw steel from iron.  Steel is
very disruptive to mage spells, and it tends to resist enchantment.
  
@CElectrum@n
A rare alloy consisting of gold, silver and copper, electrum is
silver-gold in color, is lighter than gold, and is quite soft. 
Therefore, it tends not to last when forged into weapons and armor. 
However, ancient mages discovered that electrum is extremely receptive to
magic, so much so that it does not hinder a mage's spell-casting ability.
  
@CMithril@n
The process of creating mithril is one of the most guarded secrets of the
elves, whose ancients were said to have worn suits of enchanted mithril
chainmail.  However, though no outsiders know how to create mithril, many
know how to forge it.  Several master blacksmiths claim to have learned
the secret of shaping the incredibly hard, lighweight metal.  Mithril is
a bright, almost white, glimmering silver color.  Among metals, it is
second only to liridium in hardness.  Unlike liridium, however,
mithril is easier to enchant, although it does hinder a mage's spell
casting ability.
  
@CKrynite@n
Rumors abound concerning the origins of the strange, dark purple metal. 
The most popular of these rumors is that the metal came from an ancient
race of godlings, whose weapons of krynite sank into the ground of the
battlefield where they destroyed themselves in a terrifying war.
Whatever its origins, krynite is undoubtedly magical in nature.  All
krynite exudes a soft, pallid glow, which fades as the metal gets
fatigued.  However, because every pore of the metal is infused with
magic, it will always resist infusions of further energy, such as
enchantment.  Krynite will not interfere with a mage's spell casting
ability.  The metal is incredibly expensive, and so difficult to work
with that only a genius could ever hope to forge it.
  
@CTitanium@n
A rare metal found occasionally in the deepest of mines, titanium is dark
gray in color, almost silvery due to its luster.  It is very hard,
extremely light and resists corrosion.  The dwarves, who are rumored to
be the first to have encountered this metal, value it highly and have
perfected methods to temper and shape it.  However, only the best of
armorsmiths and weaponsmiths are able to tame it into a useable form. 
Small amounts of titanium occasionally finds its way into jewelry, as the
metal seems to have the quality of nullifying magic, being vary stable in
form and extremely resistant to change.

@CLiridium@n
Almost nothing is known about this rare, dull-gray metal.  It is said
that those who discovered and could forge the metal have all died. 
Another rumor holds that liridium is so hard that it can be forged only
with the combination of a giant's strength and archmage's magic. 
Liridium is second only to diamond in hardness.  A warrior's metal,
liridium makes incalculably valuable weapons and armor.  It is
extremely difficult to enchant, and is, for mages, the most disruptive
material known.

16 0 1 Mind Blade~
.The premier attack spell of the psionic.~

.~

0 0 1 Mind Blank~
.The long path of dark arts teaches the sorcerer ultimate control over
body and mind.  In preparation for their transformation into a lich, the
caster begins by removing all emotions and fears from their mind, sealing
it against intrusive thoughts.  Then once the mind is guarded, they move
to the mortal flesh, pouring necromantic magic into every cell until it
hardens like steel.
~

.Effect -- Self only -- Increase of 10%+(L*5)mind and magic resist, adds
sleep resist flag.  decreases hunger/thirst tick 
Reagent -- Scroll of dark mastery
Resist -- Nill
I don't agree with sleep resistant things, but the bonus mind resist will
do the same thing 
~

16 0 0 mind blow~
.Conjuring up dark nightmares the sorcerer assaults the mind of their
victim.  A quick and brutal spell the mind blow sends its target reeling
from the pain and poisonous thoughts.
~

.cast_mess Staggers under the mind blow
~

0 0 1 Mind Crush~
.This vicious spell inflicts debilitating nighmares and pain on a target's
mind often reducing them to a quivering heap.  The dark magics invade the
mind, twisting and distorting the world around them, and shattering the
victim both physcally and mentally.  As with most nightmare based spells,
this has no effect on creatures without a mind.
~

.Effects -- direct damage
Reagents -- Book of Lies, knot of tangled nightmare hair(consumed)
Resist -- Mind
~

0 0 1 Mind Destruction~
.Taking physcal form, this nightmare spell attacks the mind and body of a
target in a relentless onslaught of terror and pain.  Even if the target
survives the claws of the creature, they are often so exhausted by the
attack that they fall victim to the next wave of sorcerer might.  As the
creature exists in a quasi-real way it can inflict damage to mindless
creatures.
~

.Effect -- Direct damage Physcal
Reagent -- Book of dark summons,  knot of tangled nightmare hair(consumed)
Resist -- Mind
~

0 0 1 Mind Snap~
.This spell torments the target with nightmarish images that overwhelm
them with horror and fear so real that they begin to die from the
onslaught.  Although a low end nightmare spell, it can be very effective
on the weak of will and simple creatures.  Undead and those without fear
or sentient thought are unaffected by this spell.
~

.Effect -- Inflicts 3d8+(2XL)- Wisdom modifier of victim
Reagent -- Nill
Resist -- Mind
cast_mess -- Staggers under the fiendish onslaught
~

0 0 1 Minor Enchantment~
.This spell is used to enchant a weapon increasing the damage it does and
improving its chance of striking a target, or armor, increasing its
protective qualities.  The effect is permament.  There is a small chance
with this spell that something will go wrong and the object will be
destroyed in the process.~

.~

0 0 1 Mists of Sleep~
.A more complicated and draining spell than Sleep, this one is greater in
that it conjures forth mists of dizzing light and scintillating colors. 
From this the spell can insinuate itself into the minds of many more
targets in the area.  ~

.~

0 0 19 Misty Marsh~
.Long ago, Khutek, the hedge wizard, was practicing a powerful spell
involving calming mists.  Being an inexperienced mageling at the time,
the spell failed, and disastrous environmental consequences occurred in
the marsh where he had been training.  Khutek chucked it up as a learning
experience and moved on.

The enchanted mists still envelop the region south of the Elhanni River
today.  Numerous rumors abound of mysterious creatures that now inhabit
the region, mutated by the magic that Khutek unleashed years ago.~

                         @M*****@n
Of course 80d15 is an awfully random hitpoint mob so 20d10+2200 would be
a better choice and much more predictable.

----------------------------------------------------------
@R2)@n Mpcode Damage for mobs.
              Tank Damage              Randoms
@C*@n Levels 1-40 - 4*Level                 2*Level
@C*@n Levels 40-80- 5*Level                 3*Level
@C*@n Levels 80-90- 6*Level                 3*Level
                         @M*****@n
- Tank damage includes any attack that cannot target a random character
in the room and does not include area attacks.
- Random attacks are calculated by taking the max damage of the attack
times the % chance of its occurance ( Count area attacks only once ).
- Area attacks use the following equation (in order to give the players a
chance) 
       @Y ( 4 * % chance of occurance * damage )@n
@Y***@n  Healing costs are factored into mpcode damage ratings!
- use the following simple formula..
       @Y( hps healed * percentage chance of occurance ) * @e.@n@Y75@n
----------------------------------------------------------
@R3)@n Marmor for mobs.
@C*@n Level 1-20 max marmor is 1-2 per any one location.
@C*@n Level 20-60 max marmor is 1/4 Mob level.
@C*@n Level 60-90 max marmor is equal to 1/3 Mob level.
There are always exceptions to this within reason.
                         @M*****@n
- i.e. for a level 1  mob...................... marmor 1000 1 toughened skin
- i.e. for a level 20 mob...................... marmor 1000 7 grizzled arm
- i.e. for a level 60 mob...................... marmor 1000 20 heavily scaled body
-------------------------------------------------------------
@R4) Coins.@n
@YCoin standards will be in-place when the final economy is finalized.@n
-------------------------------------------------------------
@R5) Wielding and Non-wielding.@n
Mobs that reset and wield weapons, must have separate mpcode for wielding
and non-wielding damage.  Use of the is_wearing() functions checks to see
what item the mob is 'wielding'.  Damage from wielding mobs should be
(except in the 5 and lower level category) 10-25% more, the higher the
level of the mob, the more damage it should be performing.  This also
applies to area attacks that involve the weapon (not a normal case).
-------------------------------------------------------------
@R6) Guard/Protector Mob Levels.@n
-------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a list of the different types of protector mobs and their
@Capproximate@n levels.

Level 50-60 for city guards.
Level 40-45 for warders and rangers.
Level 50-65 for army soldiers.
Level 65-75 for officers.
Level 80+ for special commanders.
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
@R7) Pets.@n
Pets use two sets of mpcode, a set of mpcode that is used when it is not
a pet, and a set of when it is a pet.  The mpcode for pets when it is a
pet is 80% of the mob standard for its mob damage.
Pets should not have 100% mind resistance.
Experienced pet damage function assumes an average of 3 attacks per
round, try not to stray too far from this.

This help file is designed to give a quick crash course for newer immortals
into mob creation, and give a checklist of sorts each builder knows what fields
should be set and how they can be entered.  If in doubt, take a peek at other
mobs that are similar to what you want that already exist, or ask for help.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=> MSETS <=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In most of these fields, if you are unsure what values are applicable, type
mset and the field name by itself.  A list of possible values will appear.

Nation       : This field is used for mobs whose death will cause shifts
               in a player's reputation.  Primarily used for mobs that reside
               in a town.  Set this field to the 'clan' they belong to.
Level        : What level of experience is the mob?
               Make sure the level of the mob fits your zone profile
Fame         : Not used at this time
Sex          : male, female, neutral, or random
Coins        : The amount of coins that your mob should be holding on a
               regular basis.  Don't mreset coins, use this field.
Size         : How big is your mob?  Note:  Changing races does not
               automatically update this field.
Hitdice      : How many hit points does your mob have?  See the help file
               mob_standards for standards information.
Maturity     : Not used at this time
Group        : Mobs who are designed to assist each other in battle, or be
               able to be summoned by their chief if he/she's attacked need
               to have this field set to a common value.  You can use a pre-set
               group name, or have one created for you.  Values stored in a
               table called groups.
Kills        : Game tallies how many times the mob has been killed
Race         : What race is your mob supposed to be?  Type mset race to see a
               list of available races.  Note:  Nation and size are not updated
               when you set race, you must adjust those manually.
Wander       : If a mob is able to walk around (see mflag sentinel), this field
(200-4999)     determines how fast they will change rooms.  Default is 4000,
               the lower the number the faster they move.
Weight       : How much does your mob weigh?  This field is important for
               corpses, because almost every mob uses a generic corpse which
               use this field's setting to determine how much it should weigh.
Mvdice       : How many movement points should your mob have?  Mobs which stay
               within their own zone can have the default left alone, but mobs
               which might be used as pets should have this value adjusted
               higher.
Price        : This field is used for animals which can be bought in a pet shop.
               This field sets the price for the animal.
Deaths       : Code automatically tracks how many times this mob has died.
Alignment    : Is your mob good or neutral or evil?
Light        : Does your mob carry its own light?  Traditionally mobs do not,
               because the room will usually be lit if it needs to be.  A
               normal ball of light has a setting of 50.
Adult        : This will be used when maturity is fully in effect.
Skeleton     : If a cleric can use their spell greater animation on this mob's
               corpse to turn it into a skeletal pet, mset the skeleton that is
               created in this field.  (ie: a skeletal ferret for a ferret).
               The skeletal pet must already exist and have a mob number.
Zombie       : Same as skeleton, but for the spell animate dead.
Corpse       : What sort of corpse should this mob leave behind when dead?
               Mobs such as ghosts/etc. that do not leave corpses do not need to
               have this field modified, because the mflag ghost takes care of
               that.  The standard is 10 (the corpse of a monster).  That corpse
               will automatically change names when the corpse is created.
               (ie: cat dies.  When object 10 (corpse) is loaded, it will
               automatically show up as 'a corpse of a cat'.  You must set your
               mob's weight or every corpse will only weigh 10 lbs.

Str (3-30)   : A mob's strength.  Helps them hit harder.  Based on race/class.
Int (3-30)   : A mob's intelligence.  Based on class.
Wis (3-30)   : A mob's wisdom.  Based on class.
Dex (3-30)   : A mob's dexterity.  How well they dodge.  Based on race/class.
Con (3-30)   : A mob's constitution.  Even though hitpoints are manually set,
               still enter this one based on race/class.

Mag (-100to+100) : A mob's resistance to magic attacks such as magic missile.
Fir (-100to+100) : A mob's resistance to fire attacks.
Col (-100to+100) : A mob's resistance to cold attacks.
Min (-100to+100) : A mob's resistance to sleep attacks.
Ele (-100to+100) : A mob's resistance to electrical attacks.
Aci (-100to+100) : A mob's resistance to acid attacks.
Poi (-100to+100) : A mob's resistance to being poisoned.

Name        : The core identified name of a mob.  Optional.  (NPC's required)
              This field shows up on scans. (ie: west:  Joe Mob)
              This is the proper name of your mob after they're looked at.
Singular    : The core unidentified name of a mob.  Required.
              This field shows up on scans. (ie: west: (a) slack-jawed local)
              This is what your mob is named before they're looked at.
              Automatically generated at creation, can change later if desired.
Prefix_S    : Posts before Singular, and before Adj_S.  Optional.
              A descriptive field for the very beginning of a mob's appearance.
Adj_S       : Posts after Prefix_S, but before Singular.  Optional.
              A descriptive field for the beginning of a mob's appearance
Long_S      : Posts after Singular field.   Required.
              A descriptive field for the end of a mob's appearance.  Usually
              an action description (ie:  is standing here, glaring at you)
Plural      : The core unidentified name of a group of similar mobs.  Required.
              This field shows up on scans. (ie: west: (2) slack-jawed locals)
              This is what a cluster of mobs looks like.  Must set manually.
Prefix_P    : Posts before Plural, and before Adj_P.  Optional.
              A descriptive field for the very beginning of a mob's appearance.

              an action description (ie:  are standing here, glaring at you)
Keywords    : Should always be set on mobs with a formal name.  This way you
              can 'goto Joe Mob' instead of trying to remember that Joe Mob is
              described as a slack-jawed local.
Color       : Changes the color of the singular/plural fields when you are
              standing in the same room as the mob.  Does not color any other
              fields.  See help color_code for options (red2 = red bold)

Description : The mob's description, just like a player description.  Same type
              of rules apply.  Use the mdesc command to edit this field.
              Every mob should have a minimum of 3-5 lines for a description.

AFFECT FLAGS:

If an affect flag is toggled on, it means that mob retains that particular
ability or disability at all times.  Most options are the same exact spells
as players receive.  Oddly-sounding affect flags are listed below.
NOTE:  Many of these flags exist to track the disabilities of players/mobs
that are already in action (ie:  If you get blinded, your personal mflag
'blind' gets turned on until the spell wears off so the code can react)

This help file is designed to give a quick crash course for newer immortals
into mob creation, and give a checklist of sorts each builder knows what fields
should be set and how they can be entered.  If in doubt, take a peek at other
mobs that are similar to what you want that already exist, or ask for help.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=> MARMOR <=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Although mobs can wear any piece of armor via mreset, the code does not add up
the AC of the items worn in order to determine how well they take a hit.  Mobs
use a code function called marmor to calculate which 'body part' is struck,
and then how well that body part can absorb a blow.  Builders can set up to 5
unique 'body parts', and assign an AC value to that setting.

Every time a mob is struck by a player, the code rolls a number from 1-1000.
If the number falls in the range of a particular body part, its AC is used
in the calculation of damage, and its name is displayed in combat. (ie: your
slash MUTILATES a bugbear raider's <fur-covered leg>).

The amount of AC that should be set (regardless of whatever a mob is wearing)
can be figured using the standards displayed in the help file mob_standards.

CONTEXT:

MARMOR #   %  AC BODYPART
MARMOR 1  333 19 fur-covered leg
MARMOR 2  666 20 furry belly
MARMOR 3 1000 18 snarling face

#        = position # to edit (1-5)
%        = percentage of this body part being hit
AC       = the AC value of this body part (how much damage is reduced)
BODYPART = The name of the body part being struck

In this case, if the combat roll falls from 1-333, the leg will be hit, and
333-666 will strike the furry belly.  Striking the leg will deduct damage as
if the mob was wearing AC19 armor in that location, and the belly 20 AC, etc.

Marmor values should grow in percentage value down the list, and the last
setting must be set to 1000.

should be set and how they can be entered.  If in doubt, take a peek at other
mobs that are similar to what you want that already exist, or ask for help.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=> MPCODE <=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The method in which mobs attack players is determined using mpcode (mob code).
This code is looped once per round, so make sure you aren't choreographing an
entire battle on one page.  The best way to make a good combat routine is to
find a mob whose fighting style mimics the way you want your new mob to fight,
and copy/paste the majority of the combat code, making modifications for damage
and hit names.

The amount of damage a mob should deal to a player/group is displayed in the
help file mob_standards.

MPCODE can also refer to specialty mob programs.  Use the command MPEDIT to
create these special code styles, which are coded very similarly to acodes or
mpcodes, but ch defaults to the mob itself, and victim = the person the mob
is directing the action against.

Since disarm is now a viable option, make sure you code any mob who wields a
weapon properly.  See bugbears/hobgoblins/kobolds for proper methods of
handling this issue.  If you need any assistance with mob attack programs,
contact Tyrone, Adakar, or Rikahn.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=> MRESETS <=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Mobs can wear or hold just about anything you want them to.  This command is
used to let mobs wear armor, wield weapons, hold items in inventory, etc.

To add an item to a mob's inventory, you must be holding an example of the
item first (oload to yourself), then 'mreset <item keyword>'  It will be added
to the mreset list.

To delete an item from a mob's mreset list, type 'mreset # delete'

To see the list of mresets on a particular mob, type mreset by itself.

Example:

RRL (Re-roll)    : To toggle this function, type mreset # -1 (off) or +1 (on)
                   Whenever a * is present, from that point on the code will
                   roll a new percentage chance for an object to reset.
                   (Total # of *'s = max # of objects a mob might hold)
                   This is used if you want to have a chance for different
                   kinds of objects to reset in the same position.

1_ch             : 1st chance.  Percentage chance that an item will load.
                   For every * Rrl, a 1-100 die is rolled.
                   The code will go through the list of mresets until a new
                   * is listed, and determine if/which objects get reset.
                   Place the rarest objects first on the list.

2_ch             : For an even harder (or a better 'random' roll) chance at
                   resetting an item, you can 'link' rolls together.  If a
                   value is set in 2_ch next to a 1_ch value, it will roll
                   a 1-100 number for 1_ch.  If 1_ch 'passes' its reset %,
                   then a new 1-100 number will be rolled for 2_ch.  If that
                   roll passes its 2_ch %, then the object will load.
                   (ie: 1_ch 50, 2_ch 50 = 50% of 50%, which gives 25%)

3_ch             : Same as 2_ch, but extends it out to a third roll.

Rust             : If an object is made out of a tarnishable metal, this is
                   the % chance that it will load in some sort of tarnished or
                   rusty condition.  Whether an object is slightly or very
                   rusty cannot be pre-set, the code randomly selects the
                   level of rust.  Most objects should be set in the 95-99%
                   range unless its description/rarity dictates otherwise.

Posi             : The position where a mob will be wearing the item.  If you
                   are resetting armor, which body part is this item worn?
                   Weapons go in right.hand or left.hand.  Don't reset an item
                   in a slot it shouldn't be in.  Type <mreset # posi> to see
                   the list of potential slots.  Inv = Inventory.  Means the
                   mob is holding the item but not wearing it.

Liq              : If a mob is holding/wearing a drink container, this field
                   determines what kind of liquid it will be filled with.
                   <mreset # liq> shows a list of choices.  If your container
                   always seems to reset empty even if a liquid is chosen,
                   see the note about object value settings.

Flags            : Two position flags are possible for objects.  If an object
                   is designed to be a container (ie: You want a mob to hold
                   a bag full of rocks in his inventory), you need to flag it
                   as +C for container.  <mreset # +C>.  A container should be
                   the last thing you reset on a mob, except for what might go
                   inside of the bag (it's just easier to read that way).
                   To mreset an item inside of a container, mreset the inside
                   object(s) after the container item, and flag them +I for
                   inside. <mreset # +I>  Containers and inside items can have
                   their own % resets.  Inside items will not reset unless the
                   container makes its reset chance.

Vnum             : The object # of the item being mreset.

Descr            : A quick description of the object being mreset.

16 0 5 Mobs~
.Following will be an ongoing list of standards for whatever:
  
1) hitdice for mobs: leveld10+10*level
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- i.e. for a level 2 mob........2d10+20
- i.e. for a level 15 mob......15d10+150
- Course 50d10+500 is pretty abusive to cpu.  When too many die-rolls are
wanted, 0d0+1000, or 10d25+750, for example, might be better.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2) mpcode damage attacks for mobs: 5x for lower level mobs and 3x for
    upper level mobs(plus an additional 20% random special attack
    totaling 2x.)
This is minimal work.  The higher the mobs, the more mpcode they tend to
need.  Look at the well known high level mobs for examples.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- i.e. 2nd mob...mpcode 1 attack( mob, victim, 2d4+2, "punch" );
- where you get 5x or 5(2) = 10 and 2*4+2 = 10
- i.e. 15th mob...mpcode 1 attack( mob, victim, 2d4+2, "right hand" );
- mpcode 3 attack( mob, victim, 2d4+2, "left hand" );
- mpcode 5 attack( mob, victim, 3d5+0, "spin-kick" );
- mpcode 7 if( random( 1, 10 ) < 3 )
- mpcode 9 attack( mob, victim, 3d10+0, "sonic wail" );
- thus...3x or 3(15) + 2x or 2(15) = 75 = 2*4+2 + 2*4+2 + 3*5 + 3*10
- where the 3d10+0 equals the special attack at the 20% random for 2x in
- the formula
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
let me know if you think we need a standard for anything else for mobs...

0 0 8 Mobs_vs_Players~
.Far too often we see notes on the bugs, general, and ideas board asking
why mob skills that mimic player skills are better than player skills, or
even demanding that the mobs be better balanced as they have better
skills than the players.
   
This extends to things such as...  My level 10 warrior can only have 2
attacks, so why can the mob I'm obviously better than have 3 attacks? 
...Why can this mage I'm fighting cast a fireball every round yet it take
me several rounds?  ...How can this mob cast lightning bolts at me and
manage to claw me twice at the same time?  ...How can this mob is using a
sword like a fighter, spin kicking me like a monk, and casting a fireball
at me like a mage?
   
Trust me, the mobs ARE balanced to the players.
     
The experience on a mob is automatically determined by several factors,
which include how much damage the mob generally does and how long it
lives.  This leaves only a few options open to us to keep the mobs of Legacy's Dawning
interesting to the players.
- Either we give every mob you come across the same types of armor the
players have, meaning almost everything would have a hodgepodge of +1,
and +2 armor with every slot filled with something.  This would greatly
devalue the cost of equipment and one of the things that we strive for is
to have value placed on valuable equipment, so this is not an option.
- Or we modify their attacks.  Even here a balance must be struck.
  
Since there must be higher lever, more powerful mobs for the more
experienced players to fight they must be able to do enough damage to
provide a threat to people wearing the kind of armor and defensive spells
our high level players use.  To this end Legacy's Dawning has a set of standards to
which the builders adhere when creating mobs.  When a mob is assigned its
level, the standards determine how much life the mob has as well as how
much damage it must have the capacity to deal.  To preserve the value of
equipment, and insure everyone isn't pulling Flaming Mithril Swords of
Death +3 off of the kobolds, this means we modify them and give them
special attacks.  Sometimes this means we will give them a few extra
attacks in the round with mundane weapons, or modify the damage so they
tend to be doing more damage with a mundane weapon then it normally deals. 
For all you know, they are just better trained to use it.
  
Spells...  Not every spell you see a mob cast is exactly what the players
have.  The damaging effects of spells are also a part of the damage
covered under our standards.  If a mob is able to cast a fireball every
round, faster than you, it is only doing the damage it is supposed to and
its experience reward will reflect that.  Perhaps they just cast it
differently and had a better teacher or perhaps they have a better inate
ability to focus magic.  Deal with it.
  
We do try to keep them sensible, but we can not apply the same rules to
the mobs that apply to the players.  Otherwise there would probably only
be a handful of mobs on the mud yielding over 5000 experience.  Even if
that seems like a lot to you now, it won't later.  Later on, when you
need a million exp, or even just a few hundred thousand, and you need to
be killing mobs that yield 10,000 or more exp at a time having mobs whose
skills and equipment are the same as players that yield only a 5000 exp
tops will seem quite boring.  How fun do you think it'd be to kill a
million rabbits over several hours and still not level?  So bear with us,
play, have fun...  But most of all enjoy it.
  
Shade and sweet water,
Talis~

0 0 15 Monks~
.Monks are extremely deadly fighters specializing in unarmed combat.  As
@CLegacy's Dawning@n is not set in an Asian-type setting, monks are not
necessarily analogous to 'traditional' monks, but instead represent
experts at individual, unarmed combat.  Included in their plethora of
physical abilities are the skills of @Ctiger paw@n, @Cdragon strike@n,
and @Ccritical hit@n, which multiply the damage done on a strike.  Higher
level monks attain the abilities of @Cdeath strike@n, and @Cdemon slash@n. 
Unable to use armor better than that made from leather, monks rely upon
defensive skills such as @Cdodge@n, @Cparry@n, and @Cshadow dance@n to
provide them with protection.  While very weak at lower levels, monks are
indispensible to any group seeking to battle any powerful foe, because
their ability to inflict massive damage is required for victorious combat.

Monks, please see the help file on @CAbilities@n.

Once a much more populous location, it was a busy fishing port where many
boats put out to sea to fish the frigid waters of the Moonfall.  The

@CDESCRIPTION@n

This is used to reset an object on ALL mobs of the type being editted. 
They must be wearing or holding the object you want to reset and it will
reset as they currently are using it.  Mreset 1_ch <#> allows you to set
the repop rate from 1-100%.  (See help reset for details on the dice
columns.) 1% is to be used for extremely good items, and is, as the
number implies, extremely rare.  100% is frowned upon because it creates
too much clutter.  Remember that the more mobs there are, the more often
an item pops.

@I@cMreset <#> position@n with no argument will show all the slots
equipment may be worn in.  If you wish to have two different items in the
same slot, you will have to use mreset <#> -1 to remove the reroll bit
from the second item.  Otherwise, they will both pop in the same slot at
the same time.  If you wish to set flags on an item in mreset, you must
use: mreset <#> +<flag>.

@I@eObject Flags:
        @cC)ontainer - Object is flagged as a container
        @cI)nside - Object goes in last object loaded with C flag set.@n

Anything flagged as a container *MUST* be the first item reset for the
items flagged as inside to load properly.

16 0 27 Mreset_Repop_Guide~
.@CMreset Repop Guide@n

Following, please find suggested mreset chances for most mundane armors.

Bronze mundane armor: (mob level/5)%. Shouldn't pop on mob under level 10.
Iron mundane armor: (mob level/10)%. Shouldn't pop on mob under level 25.
Steel mundane armor: (mob level/15)%. Shouldn't pop on mob under level 40.
Mithril mundane armor: (mob level/20)%. Shouldn't pop on mob under level 55.

Mundane weapons: see armor of same material.  Double reset chances and
halve the level they shouldn't appear on.

Magic items: (mob level/5) - (item level/5) = mreset%.  Mobs can't pop an
item higher level than they are.  If they pop an item the same level as
they are, reset should be set to 1%.

The most important fact to remember is that you are NOT setting the
percent chance that an item is ON the mob, you are setting the chance
that is it on the mob, and survived the combat well enough to be useful
to a player.~

ground, in the forested hills of the Cairn Mountains.

With the arrival of the humans the naga became increasingly withdrawn
into their strongholds.  The naga wished to wage war on the humans, but
being fewer in numbers they called on the elves for aid.  The elves
however preferred to withdraw from the humans, and retreated to the Vaasa. 
Facing the bitter truth that they could not win a war with the humans
they retreated further into places that the humans found inhospitable.

Most of the areas they abandoned, although some of the younger naga
refused to abandon some of the sacred sites.  The naga are incredibly
long lived and have been isolated for centuries.  In this time they have
lost a lot of their culture, and their civilization has fallen to a
hunter-gatherer society.  The new naga are taught that these are times of
and that which humans and their allies have caused the nagas great
suffering.  This has made the nagas xenophobic to the point of almost
open hostility towards those not of their race.

In recent times the warleader of Sos-kul has tried to open negotiations
with the nagas, and has sent one of his wise lizardmen to act as an
ambassador.~

Changing a single letter to make a minor difference is essentially the
same as using the donor name.  Klown will essentially be treated the same
as Clown.  It is a pretty blatant and poor attempt.
  
It is not impossible to come up with a decent and original name.
However, if you are going to steal a name from a book:
1) Don't steal obvious names like Bilbo or Gandalf
   steal more obscure people, tertiary characters,  support characters.
2) If there's a good chance others will know you, don't contradict
   yourself by making Baba Yaga the orc thief, or Ali Baba
   the human paladin.  If you steal a name, you take with it
   certain concepts and atmosphere.  Don't offer up the concept
@yNOTE:@n You risk the chance that the immortals will decide that your
name is too well-known.~

0 0 3 Name_Similar~
.This mud uses name completion.  Player names which contain, or are
substrings of extant names are not permitted.  This avoids confusion
among players.  The name Malice, for example, would be forbidden if the
name Mali already existed, and vice-versa.  The name you chose conflicted
with an already existing name.  Please choose another.
~

.~

0 0 3 Names~
.When choosing a name, make it unique and original when possible. Your
name should reflect the time setting of our world, which is most closely
related to that of the medieval time period. Try not to copy names or
use names that will be outside the following guidelines:

@YNames ALLOWED@n:
 @C*@n Completely made-up name or other not-easily recognized name.
   Names should be MEDIEVAL or FANTASY sounding and mostly pronounceable,
   such as Handaran, Aelrynne, and Kuhrt.
 @C*@n Common proper names, such as David, are generally permitted.
   However, try to conform your name to your racial type. So
   Lisa and Robert would be all right for humans, but not orcs.
   If your name is very unlike your race as defined by help @b<race>@n,
   then it won't be allowed

@YNames NOT ALLOWED@n:
 @C*@n Almost all words in the English dictionary except proper names.
   Adjectives, adverbs and generally descriptive words are not names.
   Avoid names based on verbs, such as Slasher, Mauler, Killer.
 @C*@n Names associated with well-known historical or fictional figures
   that is not also merely a common name, such as Cleopatra or Gandalf.
 @C*@n Names associated almost exclusively with a major religious figure.
 @C*@n Names of large cities around the world that aren't also common names.
 @C*@n Names that are anachronistic (anything not approximately medieval,
   such as Rocketman).
 @C*@n Names must not include a title, such as Sir, Queen.
 @C*@n Foreign words that are offensive or is otherwise not permitted
   as above.
 @C*@n Nicknames or Names that depend upon the person you are now or some
   physical attribute, such as Lightfingers, Stubbytoes, or One-eye.
 @C*@n Bastardizations that are offensive-sounding or an obvious
   version of words not belonging to this world.
 @C*@n If an immortal says your name violates one of the above rules, it does.

As long as the name is @cnot offensive@n, Immortals and Avatars should
politely ask for a name change. If the person refuses, please unapprove
the person and talk to an Immortal. Imprisoning the person, freezing
them, or disconnecting them is not appropriate unless the person is
uncooperative.

If the name is @coffensive@n, you may either ask them to change the name or
disconnect them immediately.  This decision should be based on the degree
of offensiveness and how reasonable the person is.  Some people do logon
for the sole purpose of causing trouble.

Most importantly, if an immortal asks you to do something (such as change
your name) it is assumed they have a good reason and you should comply.

@CNOTE@n: Just because you were approved does not mean your name is
automatically a good name. If you know it is a bad name, sooner or later,
you will be asked to change it.

.The note board editor works somewhat differently than the editor used for
other features on the mud.

A) The '?' feature for replacing words on a line currently doesn't work. 
Corrections must be made by line replacement.

The syntax for this would be @Cnote <line#> <new line>@n.

B) You can prefix a line with a backslash '\' to allow you to put a
number or indent at the start of a line.

C) You can format a note to the end by typing <line#>-.  <line#>-<line#>
still formats a specific part of the note.

D) The note buffer won't auto-echo back at you, re-type 'note' to get it
to send you the note that you're editing.

16 0 25 Object_Opcodes~
.@YOBJECT OPCODES@n

@CWEAPONS - Hit opcode@n

@cRepetition@n
As a general rule, opcodes on weapons should fire at a 10% ratio
or less, with a sliding scale based on weight.  A special-equipped
weapon's base opcode (excluding lucky looped extra hits) should not
go off more than three times in one battle.  The heavier the weapon,
the less its opcode will even be able to appear because it won't swing
as often, and vice versa for the light unarmed weapons, so adjust
accordingly.  The reason for this rule is because of how a weapon will
perform and look in combat.

@cOpcode Damage@n
Weapons should not have an opcode that strikes for more damage than a
base hit from the weapon unless extreme circumstances warrant it.
As a general rule, opcode hits should do around 50% of the damage of a
base hit.  Extreme care and extensive playtesting should be done to make
sure that a weapon's overall average damage comes as close as possible to
the max damage rating of the weapon's final level so it balances out with
a base weapon of that level.  A level 30 weapon with opcodes should not
outperform a base L30 weapon of the same variety (it just looks prettier).

@cLevel Penalties@n
A wide range of considerations goes into the determination of what level an
object with opcodes will possess, to include repetition, additional damage,
weight, oflags, etc.  There is no set formula to determine exactly how a
weapon will turn out.  As a basic guide, figure out the weapon's level for
its base damage and then add extra levels based on how much extra damage
the opcode will provide as a long-term average.  An additional method would
be to determine what level you want the weapon to end up as and downsize the
base damage to 'make room' for the opcode.  Final level statistics will be
determined during object review and approval.

@cMiscellaneous Information@n
The main thing to think about with opcodes is to test how it will perform
in the hands of a real player in real combat.  People like shiny objects.
If it goes off to little it 'sucks' and people despise it.  Go off too often,
and people will complain that they don't have one.  Great care should be taken
to make sure a special weapon actually balances out with its bland counterpart
for numbers, but also its looks as well.~

0 0 17 Off-hand Attack~
.This skill allows players to wield a weapon in each hand.  Doing so
eliminates the possibility of using a shield or a two-handed weapon, but
given an intelligent choice of weapons it should increase the damage a
warrior can do.  Only dagger type weapons can be wielded in the off-hand,
as two swords, for example, would be completely unmanageable.

The command to use a secondary weapon is : hold <dagger_name>

A second off-handed attack is planned to be implemented soon exclusively
for warriors.~

0 0 17 Off-Hand Parry~
.The use of an off-hand weapon greatly reduces the fighter's ability to
avoid an opponent's attack.  After years of practice with off-hand
attacks, the warrior/ranger begins to learn how to actually parry with
his/her off-hand weapon.  Although not as effective as a shield, it does
reduce the damage taken in battle.  This is an autoskill.

What follows is a guide to level restrictions appropriate for the various
oflags that can be put on an item as a benefit or disadvantage.

Also, we'll be adding guidelines regarding how many magical effects you
should put on any given item, as well as relating affects to body
locations.

@WNOTE:@n For any spell effect: add (spell level * 3) unless the item is restricted
                   only to the class that can cast the spell best.
                   If it is restricted, figure the mana/regen that the
                   a character gets back from not having that spell
                   leeched, if they knew the spell at 7, and raise the
                   level of the item as though you were giving them
                   that many Mana Points instead.

This covers: Armor, Bless, Displacement, Detect Evil, Detect Hidden,
See_invis, Detect magic, faerie_fire, fire_Shield, infravision,
invisible, holy_wrath, prot.  plants, water_walking, water_breath,
Vitality, Detect Good/Evil, Ogre Strength, Float, Barkskin, pass door,
haste, resist.fire, resist.cold, prot.vs.evil, prot.vs.good, Fly,
sense_life, true_sight, resist.acid, resist.shock, thorn_shield,
ion_shield, see_camoflage

0 0 10 Ogres~
.@GAverage Statistics for Ogres@n

Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"
        females about 6'4" - 7'2"

Hair: Browns, black, reds and rarely gray.
      It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though
      ear, nose, shoulder and back hair are quite common.

Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors that are mainly
      shades of gray.  Sometimes they have hints of red or black as well.
      The Irises are large leaving only a thin margin of the sallow to gray
      surrounding it visible.

Alignment: Ogres are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic
neutral alignments.

Appearance: Ogres are most often quite muscular with odd protuberances,
large warts and cysts most frequently, as well as having frequent patches
of hair-covered warts that can confuse their bulky shape.  Most ogres
have poor postures and stoop horrendously.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky
shade of grey-brown, sandy-brown, or a ruddy red-brown but it is always
somewhat rubbery.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Ogre@n

As a general rule, ogres are big, mean and dumb.  They are typically
brutish and like to bash anything smaller them as much as possible.  They
particularly don't like little creatures, who tend to cause problems
and/or steal things.  The general attitude of life for an ogre is pretty
simple.  If you can eat it, do so.  If you don't plan on eating it, bully
it.  If you can't bully it, then smash it.

Ogres aren't known as great conversationalists, but they are the favored
workhorse of the dark armies being the best at what is most often called
for in any combat situation.  Smash, rend and tear into itty-bitty pieces.

Ogres have no real central governing force, nor do they care overly much
for family units.  Despite the lack of central cohesiveness, they still
managed to construct a city, Denab-Knur (The ogre words for Cave you live
in, further demonstrating their creative genius).  True to form, city
government is based on strength.  The strong rule and the weak serve.

Two varieties of ogre have evolved here.  Gray ogres tend to be the
stronger and dumber of the two.  Red Ogres, so called for the ruddy hue
of their rubbery skin, are somewhat smaller in stature and possess a
smidge more intelligence than grey ogres, they are still about as smart
as a rock by the standards of most other races.


@yRacial Relations:@n

As a rule ogres dislike anything small.  Halflings, gnomes, dwarves and
goblins are all treated with contempt and should be stomped on repeatedly. 
Goblins, at least, know how to tear things apart and can, on rare
occasion, be useful in breaking something in a small places ogres can't
reach.

Trolls, though strange and frankly, pretty dumb even by ogre standards,
make for useful allies.

Orcs are viewed with a measure of respect, as they know how to cut and
build things, though they obviously aren't as good as ogres or they
wouldn't be so puny.

Vyans make useful allies, as they make good diversions when hunting elves
and are good at dealing with elven magic.  Unfortunately they are also a
nuisance as they always seem to think they are in charge.  Fortunately
they rarely get in the way of such truly important matters as smashing
things when it comes time to do so.

Elves and lizardmen are hated simply as a matter of course.  They serve
no purpose but they do bleed exceedingly well once you get past all their
silly magic and sharp claws.

Humans are an odd lot.  While some are almost as good as orcs, many more
are often as bad as elves and lizardmen.  Though its usually just easier
to smash them the same as elves, sometimes it pays off to only smash them
a little.  Once they know who's boss, they make pretty good allies.~

.@GAverage Statistics for Orcs@n

Height: males about 5'2" - 6'6"
        females about 5' - 6'6"

Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greatest of manes.  What hair does grow
      tends to be black and coarse.  Occasional shades of dark brown or
      the infrequent shade of ruddy reddish-brown do occur.

Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises.  The area around the
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.

Affiliation: orcs are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic
neutral alignments.

Appearance: Orcs frequently have dusky-hued skin tending towards shades
of brown or red.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's more pathetic than smooth, boring skin.

Orcs are not known for their great dental hygiene and often have cracked,
yellowed and missing teeth.  Fortunately for them they often grow back
missing teeth once lost.  Enlarged tusk-like canines often protrude from
the lower jaw noticeably.  Their noses are typically upturned, giving them
a pig-like or boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of the
so-called good races.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Orc@n

Orcs are typically slow and a bit dumb, never the less they know how to
be tough, wily and strong foes worthy of respect.  Orcs primarily dwell
underground and, though they can tolerate sunlight, prefer not to and
will assuredly whine at being made to spend time in the light.  Their
long years of growing as a society in the cramped tunnels and caves left
to them as the hand-me-downs of larger, brutish dark races or the more
cunning vyans has produced some pretty strong traits.  Most orcs are not
shy or withdrawn and prefer to take what they can get.  This makes for a
very combative society and one that has learned to take its own abuse. 
Their favorite hobby would have to be tormenting the goblins that somehow
always manage to be present wherever there are orcs.  Its considered
great sport, after all, they just keep taking the abuse and there are
always more.
After years of living this way, orcs finally came into contact with
humans.  Though brutal at first, some orcs did see the advantage to
living above ground in artificial caves (houses), particularly if you
build them without windows, thus keeping sunlight out.  When this faction
left, leaving more space in the caves, the remaining orcs rejoiced
greatly and proceeded to fight over the extra free space.  The split, over
many years, has caused orcs to evolve into two main groups.  An eastern
orc, seen most commonly around Voaleth, who tend to be more tribal,
chaotic and senselessly brutal.  And a western orc, seen most commonly
around Brithbarad, known to be somewhat larger and more cunning in their
brutal plots.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Orcs are known to to be none to fond of elves, finding their best value
to be the way they bleed so easily when cut, pounded or smashed.
Elves are also a good supply of elven teeth, which make fine keepsakes of
memorable raids on the unwary elf hunting party.

Despite their close resemblance to elves, orcs grudgingly respect vyans. 
After all, how bad can a people who slaughter elves even more than you do
be?

Dwarves and gnomes only have value as slaves, food or both in orcish eyes.

Orcs are generally on amiable terms with Ogres, seeing them as little
more than really large orcs.

Goblins, having turned out to be poor slaves who were too weak and lazy
as workers and too inconsistent in work quality, and about as hard to get
rid of as roaches turned out to be almost adequate allies.  They make for
great fodder in a fight and are a nearly endless source of mirth as the
butt of jokes and target of cruelty.  They just keep taking it and there
are always more.  When you break one, there always seems to be two more
ready to take its place.

Orcs and trolls do not tend to get along well at all, always managing to
find something to fight over (usually involving possessions or food),
except when hunting elves.

Humans are an odd lot and are alternately tolerated and hated by orcs
depending on whatever the current leaders' whims seem to be.  Where some
humans serve the dark forces they tend to make good allies, while humans
that serve the light are bothersome nuisances and frequently go the way
of elves.  Which is to say they end up a smear on some orc's war club.

Lizardfolk remain a nearly complete enigma.  They lived in the swamps
and, as everyone knows, there aren't caves under a swamp, just more swamp. 
Worse than that, there are only two ways to get there.  Through human
lands, and the humans keep stopping orcs to fight or talk, either one is
better than walking all day.  Or through the Vaasa, and there are just so
many elves to kill there's never a good enough reason to get to the other
side of the Vaasa.  Why go through when you can stop half way and just
keep killing elves until you're ready to go home?~

0 0 15 Paladin~
.In the beginning, temples were easy targets, so they hired warriors and
fighters to protect them.  Over time, these temple protectors not only
came to practice their arts of war, but also became devout to the
temple's god.  In this way, they became the strong arm of the church,
where their unique combination of skills were needed.  Hence, the Paladin
was born. Because of their devotion to a god, paladins gain a wide
assortment of simple spells.  Useful spells such as create light, food,
water and other curative spells are complimented by the more powerful
spell of @Cremove curse@n.  However, gaining these benefits cost these
paladins to lose some of their formidable warrior skills.  They cannot
hit quite as often as true warriors, but they learn the powerful skills
of @Cturn undead@n and @Clay hands@n.  This mixture of spells and skills
make Paladins a very powerful class, one that relies less on others for
survival in a harsh world.

life will seek the Path of Destiny.  It has been said that finding the
path is not easy as it appears to magically change locations.  Those that
have found the path and survived it have found great wealths but at great
odds.  Some report that they were unable to do some things in battle that
are commonplace.~

You must be editing the player first.
   
This is the command to attach player bug notes (much like rbug for room
bug notes) to their characters.  Perfect for keeping track of bad players. 
If you come up against a problem player, check their pbug as well, see if
they are a frequent problem or if they just merit a warning.~

16384 0 8 Pet_Rules~
.Pets can be a lot of fun and good helpers in the realm.  However, they
can also be horribly abused.  Pets are any mob following you that you
have control over that is not you.  Familiars, mounts, animals/living
things bought at pet stores, and animals/living things tamed by ranger
pet spells, and created/owned undead are all considered pets. 
Unfortunately there's also room for abuse where pets are concerned, so
here's a little lit of what not to do 
(some of these things can get you banned).

@C
You are not allowed to aquire pets with the intent to release them later
to kill them.
  @C-This means no wounding pets, making them sleep, releasing them, killing them.
  @C-This mean no taming a pet to remove it from the safety of its guardians.
    @C(ie taming sheep to remove them from Pennan to kill them elsewhere)
 @C-This also means no taming the white timber wolf to remove her from her mate
   with intent to release/kill her so you can tame her mate.
   @C(a hint, there IS a legal way to achieve taming the male)

You are not allowed to send them into battles you are not a part of.
  @C-In particular this means no sending hords of pets in to kill shop keepers
   while you stand idly by and watch them get killed by the keeper and guards.
   Honestly, what keeper/guard wouldn't notice you give the orders and attack
   you?  The code just can't handle that yet, so its not allowed.
@n

The imms can see when you aquired pets, when they are released and when they die.
It looks awfully suspicious to check your player log and find you die
once to every 20 pet deaths.  It looks equally suspicious to see you
tamed a dozen animals and released them shortly thereafter.  In fact,
that looks more like you're moving them elsewhere to be killed or killing
them yourselves.
Granted, pets will die, but there's a difference between reasonable
chance of death and abusing the options given you.  In particular this
occurs with rangers.  A ranger's communion with nature allows them to
tame the pets.  I would hate to see tame end up like familiars, only one
tame per level, becuase rangers are abusing it.  -Talis ~

@CDESCRIPTION@n

One may buy pets in pet shops, which are located in various towns.  Only
two pets are allowed at the same time, which explains the need for the
abandon option.

@CNOTE@n: When naming your pet, do not use numbers or anything other than
letters and don't name it anything even remotely resembling your name.It
can cause all sorts of problems.
 
@RNOTE@n: Be very careful when using the abandon command.  Abandoning
aggressive pets in areas where they aren't normally found, is highly
frowned upon by the staff, especially if that area is a place frequented
by newbies.

0 0 20 Phule's Phive Laws~
.@CTOPIC@n: This helpfile is intended to help those new to @CLegacy's Dawning@n get
their feet wet.  Just read Phule's Phive Laws of MUDding before you start
your adventures, and don't forget: have fun!

@CLaw 1@n:Self-Preservation.  Set your @cwimpy@n.  What @cwimpy@n does is
engage character to try to start running away whenever he (or she, of
course) is beaten down to 8 hit points.  Setting your wimpy has Phule's
personal guarantee to save your life at least once, but remember, don't
simply rely on wimpy to get you out of a tight spot.  @cFlee@ning (typing
"flee") will also allow you to protect your tender hide.

@CLaw 2@n: Con before kill.  Before you even *think* about attacking a
mob, always try to guage your chances against it.  To do this type "con
monster_name" -- perhaps "con goat" -- and hit enter.  This will make
your character "consider" his/her chance of success against that monster
in a fight.  To start a fight with a monster you come accross, type "kill
monster_name." 

@CLaw 3@n: Sustenance.  You may have received a message that you were feeling
hungry or thirsty.  Here at Legacy's Dawning you must eat and drink to be
merry.  Water is readily available from city fountains, and many rivers and
brooks also carry cool, refreshing water for your parched lips.  Food can
be a recently fallen apple, or a loaf of bread you can pick up from a
table.  Just type "eat bread" or "drink fountain" to eat and drink.

@CLaw 4@n: Clean up your messes.  After you've successfully killed a
monster, you may get more use out if than the simple experience points
you received.  Many corpses, such as those left by rabbits or foxes, can
be skinned to produce valuable pelts or meat.  Just type "skin corpse"
after the fight has ended.

@CLaw 5@n: Practice before you preach.  To achieve the best success here
Legacy's Dawning, you need to @cpractice@n and hone your skills.  For instance,
you'll have to learn to use that shiny new sword before it will do you much
good.  Many shopkeepers and special NPC's (non-player characters) have been
around and might teach you a thing or two.  Just type @cprac@n in a room
where you think one of these trainers is.  If you can be taught there, a
list of skills will appear.  Type @cprac skill_name@n to train in that skill.
Type @cAbil s, abil p or abil w@n to see a list of your abilities you can
learn.

I hope this helpfile will be of assistance to those of you who need it. 
Happy MUDding!!~

.The caster conjures forth a billowing cloud of venomous smoke that fills

Nonetheless, the cloud damages all that continue to stay in it, and will
remain in existance for a substantial time.

0 0 1 poison touch~
.A druid learns early which creatures and plants to avoid due to their

against a foe.

.~

0 0 20 Policy_1~
.Player Names - Players should choose a name that fits their character
and the medieval time period.  Immortals are encouraged to be lenient in
enforcing this, but characters with blatantly unacceptable names will be
asked to change them.  Examples of unacceptable names are Television,
GoBlue and IamGreat.  In addition to names such as those in the previous
example, names that are blatantly taken from literary, historical and
mythological characters are not allowed.  See Help Names for further
guidelines on this topic.

Immortal Help - Minor help is allowed for players lower than level 3
such as giving food when starving, giving clues when lost or finding your
corpse in deadly places.  This is to stop the mud from being too
frustrating.  After level 2 no help is allowed except in cases of bugs.
Both players and immortals will be disciplined for this.

Abusing Bugs - If you find a bug please report it.  Abusing a bug can
ruin the game for everyone and therefore players will be punished for If
it is too good to be true, it probably is, and you had better report it.

Multi-Playing - Multi-Playing is not allowed.  It gives too much of
an advantage over those who cannot do it.  It also promotes solo'ing and
works against the social structure of the mud.  Multi-players may
reasonably expect themselves to be purged.

Multiple Accounts - You may only have one account.  If you currently
have more than one please contact an immortal so your accounts can be
consolidated into one.

Multiple Characters - You are allowed to create multiple characters
provided they are on the same account.  You must not trade equipment
between your own characters, nor assist others in doing so.  You may only
have one character on from at a time.  Playing multiple characters via
multiple accounts is not permitted.

Local Area Networks (LANs) - You must notify an immortal prior to
logging on multiple characters from the same LAN/IP.  Please provide
information regarding the permanent residents on the network, and if
possible, guests who will log on from time to time at that site.

5-Minute Rule - A corollary to the rule against multiplaying.  This
rule applies to those players with more than one character.  To switch
playing one character for another, you must wait AT LEAST five minutes
before connecting as the new or 'second' character.

"Bots" - An integral aspect of mudding is its social dimension. 
Bots, or automated scripts, undermine this through the removal of the
human element from the game.  The reduction of the game to a repetitive
series of scripted actions undercuts the roleplaying environment which we
seek to foster at Legacy's Dawning.  As a result, players are not
permitted to run or use bots.  Note: This includes extended periods of
time away from the keyboard and running on triggers.

Language - We ask that players not curse or use offensive language.
While it is impossible for Immortals to monitor all channels all the
time, we ask that you police yourselves and that you please be sensitive
to your company, both those in the room with you, in the area, and on the
mud as a whole.  Players have complained about this in the past, and
minors do log on here.  Please be considerate to others during your stay
at Legacy's Dawning.

Revenge and Retribution - If you perceive that your player has been
wronged by another, please contact an immortal before doing anything
silly like trying to get them killed.  No player has the right to ruin
the game for another.  The most severe punishments are reserved for
players who take justice into their own hands and thereby spoil another
person's game.  Discuss the situation with an immortal before taking any
action of this nature.

PLEASE GO ON TO "HELP POLICY_2"

.Immortal Notes:
Also see help punishments for penalties that can be ascribed
to players when they break a rule/policy.
~

0 0 20 Policy_2~
.Zone/Area Stealing - Players should respect others on the game.  If
you enter a new area and see another person or group there, please check
with them to make sure there is room enough in the zone for you. 
Overrunning an area, or stealing it, is not permitted.  You will be
warned for the first infraction and further trespasses will warrant
penalties, including reduced experience points, level setback, or banning. 
If you feel someone has stolen a zone from you, please contact an
immortal.

Player Killing (PK) - is not allowed.  If you want to duel with
another player, please go to an arena.  If you try to get someone killed
(for example summoning them into an agressive area, walking them into a
big mob and then fleeing, etc), then you can rightly expect to be banned. 
If you find a bug which results in the accidental death of a player you
must contact an immortal immediately so it can be fixed.

Reimbs - Reimbursements may be given in some cases for losses due to
major bugs.  The normal reimbursement is the equipment you had as of the
last backup of the player files.  This may not be all that you lost but
eliminates the problem of lying so no other equipment reimbursement will
be given.  Deaths or losses due to lag are not eligible for
reimbursements.  Items lost in a crash are not eligible for reimbursement
unless they were lost on a corpse.  Reimbursements of experience due to
death will not be given without a full log of the incident.

Powerleveling - Another integral aspect of Legacy's Dawning is
earning your levels.  This requires honest work on your part, and can
sometimes be difficult.  We discourage powerleveling in all forms.  This
includes: following people around ungrouped to gain more experience
points, having the group leader (or "tank") turn his/her parry option on
so the followers get un-diminished experience points, or having a cleric
pump constant heals to you in an area significantly higher than your
level allows for.  Possible consequences of powerleveling include
warnings, reduction of your level or experience points, and repeated
offences may warrant severe action such as banning or removal of that
character from the game.  Powerleveling ruins the game for many people,
dramatically lowers an area's experience point potential, and hinders the
social aspect of our game.  If you aren't sure that a particular group or
area is considered powerleveling, please ask an immortal with the
"request" command.

Parental Supervision - Due to the violence and themes in this game,
we require the following levels of parental supervision: 

Ages 0 to 7: Constant parental supervision.  This child may not mud unless
an adult is supervising at all times.  The supervising adult may not have
their character on at the same time (penalty multiplaying).

Ages 8 to 11: Partial parental supervision.  This child may not mud
unless an adult is present at all times.  The supervising adult may play
at the same time, from a different computer only.

Ages 12 to 17: Parental guidance.  This child may not mud unless the
parent knows and gives permission to play.

Ages 18+: You may MUD.  Be sure to keep within the rules as stated in the
policies, policies2 and policies3 help files.

PLEASE GO ON TO "HELP POLICY_3"
~

0 0 20 Policy_3~
.Personal Rooms - Immortals are not allowed to add personal rooms
to areas.  Once level 95 or above you can get one in the god area.
Clans may get a fortress built, see 'help strongholds'.

Immortal Players - Immortals are allowed to play mortals so long as
they do not pkill or give out excessive amounts of equipment.  Immortals
should also keep the identity of their mortals secret from other players. 
Also immortal players MUST NOT have modified stats or be aided by the
immortal in anyway.

Equipment Swapping - Passing equipment between two or more of a
player's characters is illegal.

Repop - Losing link or quitting out to speed repop is illegal.  The
only way to legally speed up repop is to leave the zone.

Death Traps - Death traps ruin the fun of exploring and make life
frustrating.  Areas will not contain 'automatic death' traps.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Practice is the command used to pay a trainer to improve you in a skill. 
Practicing costs gold and experience points.  In most towns there are
trainers who can teach you the basic skills, but it may not be obvious
who they are.  An example is Prenslie in Chiiron can train some spells. 
Skills and spells above level 15 generally must be sought after outside
of towns.

Practice points may be gained according to the following criteria:

@Ias "bonus" practices, gained while leveling;
@Ior when a skill is used successfully;
@Ithey are not determined by XP gain;
@Ievery so often, one has a chance to gain a prac if he or she uses a
@I   skill successfully;
@Ione's chance to gain practice points is modified by INT and WIS.

INT and WIS also affect the maximum number of pracs which your character
may possess at any one time.  ("The Grey Matter Quotient", also affected
by level.) 

@CFor example@n:
Bob "Genghis" Khan goes about fighting critters, in his battles he uses
skills he already knows.  Bob "Genghis" Khan then gains a practices point
because he is using his skills and has a high wis and intelligence.  Then
after a while again he gets another, becuase his situation met the above
criteria.  Bob "Genghis" Khan can then use those practices once he has
found a teacher and practice any skill which is available.~

@CDESCRIPTION@n

If you are in dire need you can try praying for assistance.  The gods of
the game might intervene on your behalf if you have been leading a pious
lifestyle and have not been calling on them too often.  This command does
not contact player gods but instead the god of your religion.  Some
sample needs are light, food, water, and hit points which the gods may
give you in response to your prayers.  The command takes no argument and
your god determines what you are in need of.~

There are several causes of this but the most common one is you having
telnet in character mode instead of line mode.  First thing to attempt is
to telnet to port 23 instead of not including a port number.  If this
fails try hitting ctrl-] while connected.  If you get a telnet> prompt
type "mode line".

This is probably due to the network.  To find out where precisely type

16 0 16 programs 1 - basics~
.@M *** INTRODUCTION *** @n

This is the first of three helpfiles designed to help builders with
programs within the mud.  This file deals more or less with basics of
programming in general feel free to skip this file and continue to the
others if you have any programming or math background.

@M *** BASIC CONCEPTS *** @n
A program is a set of instructions.  The computer executes these
instructions from top to bottom.  When it reaches the end the program is
finished.

@C Vocabulary @n

@G";"@n This symbol is used to indicate the end of one instruction.  (in
general you should only have one instruction per line) 

@G"( and )"@n Brackets.  These are used to enclose a list of parameters
or arguments.  Each parameter or argument is seperated by a comma (",").
Also used as in math to dictate precendance of equations.

@GParameter@n defines what data a function requires.

@GArgument@n data passed to a function. Must match the functions parameters.

@GFunction@n You can think of this as a sub-program.  When a function is
called it does its stuff then the program from which it was called
continues.
A function is recognisable by the brackets after its name. This is for the parameter list.

@G"{ or }"@n Braces. Used to enclose a block of instructions.

@GBlock@n A group of instructions.

@GInteger@n Whole numbers (e.g. -59, 0, 1, 30000000 )

@GString@n A bunch of letters or numbers, enclosed in qoutes. (e.g. "hello", "eighty8 is great" )

@GCompile@n In our case this means check that the program works.  (this
is not 100% true here.  and compile has a different meaning in reality) 

@GNull@n This means literally "nothing".

@GBoolean@n This basically means true or false.

@GVariable@n Variables are like little cupboards that store a value. 
They can be of different types, integer, string or pointer variables for
example.

@GPointer@n This is like a little sign that points to some entity.  Such
as a character or a room in our case.

@C MUD PROGRAMS @n

In terms of the mud we have three times of programs:
Room programs (often refered to as acodes)
Mobile programs (often refered to as mpcodes)
Object programs (often refered to as opcodes )

These all operate more or less in exactly the same manner.

@M *** CONSTRUCTS *** @n

@C If statements @n
An if statement consists of a boolean condition and some instruction.
If the condition is true the instructions are carried out.  if false they
are skipped, the program continues from immediately after the if.

if statements are where blocks come into play, the instruction for an if
may be a block of instructions.

@YExample@n
if( i > 0 )
  eat_pie();

@YOr with a block@n
if( i > 0 ) {
  drink_coke();
  eat_pie();
}

@RNote@n there is no ";" after the if.

An if statement may be followed by and else.  An else is simply an
instruction (or block) that will be carried out in the case that the if
immediately preceeding it is false.

@YExample@n
if( i > 0 ) {
  eat_pie();
  drink_coke();
}
else {
  eat_cookie();
  drink_milk();
}
So if "i" is greater than 0.  we eat pie, drink coke and are done.  if
"i" is not greater than 0 we eat cookie, drink milk and are done.

@RNote@n An else refers to the _last_ if statement.  Only one else may be
used per if (don't laugh this is no so obvious to many people at first)

@C Loops @n

A loop is an instruction (or block) that is executed repeatedly a number
of times.  Don't worry about how many times for now.

They are defined like this:
loop( ) {
  eat_cookie();
  drink_milk();
}

This means we will continually drink milk and eat cookie until the loop is finished.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Below is a list of standard prompts which may be selected by typing
prompt <name>.

Default, Immortal, Cleric, Warrior, Simple, Complex, Color

The following are if statements.  The letter after the expression or the
phrase surrounded by single quotes is evaluated if the statement is true. 
For if not, use an exclamation mark instead of a question mark.

?p - has page info
?m - is mounted
?f - has flags set
?b - is in battle
?l - is following someone
?w - is weighed down

The next set of variables allows the inclusion of various quanties in
your prompt.  Some of them can be capitalized to get maximum values for
that statistic.

%h  - hitmarks
%e  - energy
%v  - movement points
%m  - mounts moves
%x  - experience points
%f  - flags
%t  - mud time
%T  - real time (use time -z to set zone)
%\  - carriage return
%c  - enemies condition
%C  - leader's condition
%s  - condition of self
%d  - seen exits
%g  - lowest moves of any group member
%G  - gossip points
%w  - weight word (burdened, overtaxed, etc)

As an example the default prompt is:

?p'-- MORE -- '<%f?f|%hhp %ee ?m'[%mmv]'!m'%vmv' ?b'%c'!b'%d'>

Various option flags appear in your prompt when applicable.  See @Cprompt

0 0 1 Protect Life~
.This spell attempts to transfer the subject out of danger the instance
before they die.  It takes a large toll on the caster in mana and
regeneration, but is very useful when entering unknown areas.  Due to its
nature and the uncertainty of death this spell is difficult to get right
and is often known to fail, especially when cast at lower levels.  In
contrast objects with the same affect have a much lower failure rate. 
There is one other warning that should accompany this spell, when the
victim suffers a death delivering blow and the spell successfully saves
them, the energy drain from the caster can cause massive injuries.~

.~

0 0 1 Protection Plants~
.This ranger spell enables the caster to call upon their special link with
the out-of-doors and further protect themselves from damage when fighting
monsters from the world of plants.  Although limited in the types of
monsters it works against, this spell is very effective against leafy
foes.~

Punching is much like a brawling skill.  It increases the amount of
damage that you inflict in unarmed combat with punching attacks.  This
skill, however, does not increase the damage inflicted by monk special
attacks.  Nevertheless, it is a very important skill for monks, as even
the most powerful of monks will sometimes use this skill in combat.~

qedit <quest #>     : sets the quest you will be editting
qedit new <quest #> : creates a new quest
qedit delete <#>    : deletes a quest from the quest list

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Qedit is used to create a quest and assign a certain number of quest
points to it.  Players can be in one of three states regarding each quest
on the quest list; 

1. They have had nothing to do with the quest yet.
2. They have been 'assigned' the quest but have not yet completed it.
3. They have completed the quest and recieved the points for it.
  
To change a player's state from one state to another, action, mob and
object programs are used.  Assign_quest, and Update_quest within the code
commands will change the player's states, and has_quest and done_quest
can be used to test the state of the player regarding that quest.  (See
help code, help if)

@CDESCRIPTION@n

The land of @GLegacy's Dawning@n is filled with intelligent people of
all sorts..  and not so intelligent ones.  Many of these people (NPCs)
are in need of aid for one situation or another.  Others have wondrous
items to pass on to the deserving but wish to test your worthiness to
receive such a treasure.  Still others have the most important of all
gifts to pass on, the gift of knowledge for those that follow in their
footsteps.  Many of these 'quests' are received merely by telling a
particular character 'hello' ( to <mob> hi) but some require 'asking'
about a specific item, skill, spell or person to assign their task. 
Completing the assigned 'quest' results in quest points and/or knowledge
of a trainer or skill.  Almost anyone can have a quest, so be inquisitive
and question every NPC you come across.

See also: ask, score~

.@CIMMORTAL NOTES@n

@I To create a quest the commands qedit, qset and qstat are used.  To
assign a quest to a player the assign_quest function is placed in any
script.  Similiarly a player is tagged as having completed a quest using
the update_quest function.  To check the status of a quest on a player
the functions has_quest, done_quest and doing_quest are used.

To remove quests from yourself, use qremove.~

long.  To help facilitate the two, I've divided the list into @bracial_dark@n
and @bracial_light@n.
these are not necessarily mandatory, but they should give you an idea
what the normal is.  Where something is mandatory it should be somewhat

.The listing of racial traits for those races that serve the darkness:

A more in-depth explanation can be found for each race under help
race_name as highlighted in this description.

@g- - - - -@n
@YHumans@n

The basic race type, we should all be familiar with this one.

Height: Male about 5 feet 2 inches - 6 feet tall on average
        Female about 5 feet- 5 feet 10 inches on average

Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black, red
      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or Gray (rare) iris
      White around the iris unless very sick.

@g- - - - -@n
@YVyan@n

Height: male about 4'8"-5'8"     (' means feet)
        female about 4'6"-5'6"   (" means inches)

Hair: typically stright. Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.
      brown or blond (extremely rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      violet or amber.  Though other colors such as brilliant blues
      or grays to black are not uncommon.

Note: Skin tones range primarily from midnight black to pale, wan colors. 
The vyan with the healthy glow of sun burnished skin is almost completely
unheard of.

Note: Vyans age very slowly.  You probaby won't see wrinkles before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.

@g- - - - -@n
@YOrcs@n

Height: males about 5'2" - 6'6"
        females about 5' - 6'6"

Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greates of manes. What hair does grow
      tends to be black and coarse.  Ocassional shade of dark brown
      or the infrequent shade of ruddy redish-brown do occur.

Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises. The area around the
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.

Note: Orcs frequently have dusky-hues skin tending towards shades of
browns and reds.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's worse than plain smooth, boring skin.

Note: Orcs have poor dental hiegene but also have hearty teeth that often
grow in once lost.  Enlarged, tusk-like canines often protrude from the
lower jaw noticably.  Noses are often upturned, giving them a pig-like or
boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of so-called good
races.

@g- - - - -@n
@YOgres@n

Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"
        females about 6'4" - 7'2"

Hair: Ogres have hair most frequently in browns, blacks, and reds
      and rarely gray.  It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though
      ear and nose hair as well as shoulder and back hair are common.

Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors of mainly
      greys.  Sometimes hints of red or black have appeared though rarely.
      Irises are large leaving only a little of the sallow to gray
      surrounding the eyes visible.

Note: Ogres are often muscular, but odd protuberances as well as frequent
patches of hair-covered warts can confuse the bulky shape.  Most ogres
have poor posture.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky shade of grey-brown,
sandy brown, or ruddy red-brown and is always somewhat rubbery.

@g- - - - -@n
@YTrolls@n

Height: males about 6'4" - 7'4"
        females about 6'6" - 7' 6"

Hair: Swamp trolls tend to black hair, not always on their
      head.  Where hair grows it is either greasy or coarse.
      Ice trolls tend to have white hair, with at least
      some on their head more so than elsewhere.

Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.

Note: Trolls have green skin in varying hues (though none are what would
be termed bright, neon, or electric green), They are often warty or have
cancerous appearing growths though these do not seem to affect their
health negatively in any way, rather it appears to be an excess of their
ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost never have scars, as they heal so
incredibly well.  For a race that is typically foul, corupt and evil they
have the incongruous gift of incredible regeneration at the cost of a
never-ending hunger.

@g- - - - -@n
@YGoblins@n

Height: males and females about 3'6" - 4'4"

Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.
      What hair they do grow is usually black or brown and often
      caked in muck and fiflth.  Goblins have no facial hair.

Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are primarily
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of
      dark brown or reddish-brown.  The iris extends to the edge
      of the eye with only a pupil which dilates between a pinprick
      in size to a large circle as lighting permits.

Note: Goblins have craggy skin in colors of earthy greens and browns or
patchy/mottled earthtone mixes.  Though they have warts and protuberances
less frequently than orcs, ogres, and trolls they are not completely
infrequent in some clans.  Goblins tend to have sharp teeth, though they
are small and wouldn't ordinarily be called fangs.~

.The listing of racial traits for those races that serve the light:

A more in-depth explanation can be found for each race under help
race_name as highlighted in this description.

@g- - - - -@n
@YHumans@n

The basic race type.  We should all be familiar with this one.

Height: Male about 5 feet 2 inches - 6 feet tall on average
        Female about 5 feet - 5 feet 10 inches on average

Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black, red
      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or Gray (rare) iris
      White around the iris unless very sick.

@g- - - - -@n
@YElves@n

Height: male about 4'8"-5'8"    (' means feet)
       female about 4'6"-5'6"   (" means inches)

Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white / blond ) to darkish brown.
      black (very rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      brown or blue.  Though other colors such as amber
      lavender, or other light colors are not uncommon.

Note: Elves have skin tones that range in most human ranges but almost
always touched with a healthy glow from sunlight.  Elves almost never
have pale or sickly looking skin.

Note:Elves age very slowly.  You probably wont see wrinkles Before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.

@g- - - - -@n
@YDwarves@n

Height: male and female about 3'6"-4'6"

Hair: primarily black to dark brown, lighter brown and
      blond are rare.
      ALL DWARVES (male and female) HAVE BEARDS.
      (they 'could' be shaved odd daily, but such dwarves
       should be ostracized by imms/players at every given
       chance.  freaks. :P )

Eyes: Black, brown, gray, green, and blue (rare) iris.
      White around iris, though iris is large.

Note: All dwarves grow facial hair.

@g- - - - -@n

@YEnts@n

Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"
        females about 6'10" - 8 feet tall.

Hair: Bristly or "twiggy" in earth tones.
      Dark-light browns, grays, blacks, ruddy reds,
      sandy-blonds.  Most ents also have "twiggy" beards.

Eyes: also earthy colors. blacks, grays, browns and green
      predominate though silver and green are not unheard
      of.  Iris extends to edge of eye, no whites.

notes: ENTS ARE NOT TREES.  Imagine a troll with brownish, craggy skin
though not slimy or warty.  That's an ent.  They don't have leaves, they
don't bleed sap.  Ents have 7 toes on each foot, though this need not be
put in description.  Most ents have beards.  Ents have big heads.

@g- - - - -@n

@YGnomes@n

Height: male about 3'6" - 4'6"
        female about 3'4" - 4'4"

Hair: most commonly darker shades of black or brown though
      shades of blonde and grey are not unheard of.
      A dusky red is, at best, quite rare.

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green, Grey (usually dark) and black
      large irises surrounded by white.  As the irises are
      large, so are the pupils from years of time underground.

Note: Skin tones run through all normal human ranges, though tend more
ferquently to duskier hues.

@g- - - - -@n
@YHalflings@n

Height: males about 3'2" - 4'
        females about 3'2" - 3'10"

Hair: Mostly shades of brown, some blonde or reds.  Black (rare)
      Facial hair is rare at best.

Eyes: Tending towards all natural human shades.

Note: Halflings appear much like human children though they do develop
wrinkles, graying hair and other adult attributes.  Halflings often
develop a stout build, some say due to the 5 regulated meals a day they
tend to enjoy as opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend. 
Halflings are not hobbits.  We aren't going to ban you for having hairy
feet, but realize, it is not the norm.

@g- - - - -@n
@YLizardfolk@n

Height: male and female 5'6" - 6'2"

Hair: (you're kidding, right?)  They don't grow hair.

Eyes: Reptillian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.

Notes: Lizardfolk, lacking hair for descriptions, often employ the
descriptions of the various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the
way a snake's scales form interesting patterns, the lizardfolk develop
patterns in many tones.  Included are clans with anywhere from subdued,
earthy tones to ones with vibrant hues of red, orange and yellow. 
Lizardfolk skin is typically soft and smooth like a snakes, though wet,
fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been noted before as
well.

@g- - - - -@n
@YCentaurs@n

Note: Considered a light race, but exempted from this list until such
time as it may be reintroduced as a player-base option.~

0 0 7 Ragezer~
.@RRagezer@n - God of Dirt and rocks.

Bursting from the ground below, Ragezer is known by his followers as the
true god of the earth.  Disdaining and ignoring Duroth's influence in the
matter, they believe Ragezer's power over dirt and rocks is supreme,
because clubs and throwing stones are both made of rocks and both can be
used to crush dwarf skulls.  Ogres and orcs mostly follow him, and the
ogres often wield large clubs or other stone weapons in reverence for
their god.  Orcs usually at least carry a warhammer to symbolize his
crushing power.  He also has a following among those of the realm more
attuned with the baser elements, who disdain 'nature' but care more for
the simple needs of the land.

Ragezer is thought to his worshippers to have created all of the deserts
and the mountains, and the fact that the followers of Duroth live in one
of these holy mountain ranges annoys them to no avail.  Indeed, there are
many battles between the two peoples over that is the true god of the
earth, and these battles are always ferocious and bloody, with neither
side giving an inch in the opinions of their gods.

When Ragezer appears to his followers, and he is said to often, because
he has little agenda other than spreading his ways, he is known to appear
as a cross between a desert ogre and an orc, of ogrish size, inheriting
the best features from each race, such as the most powerful tusks and the
nicest configuration of warts.  He is known to wear a large wolf skin
cloak, and always carries a huge stone club with him, which he swings
with the greatest of ease.  His symbol is that of an over-sized club of
solid rock, bursting from the ground in a huge sandy coloured hand, and
can often be found on tribal banners alongside the clans symbol, or
tattooed onto the skin of his people.~

16 0 19 Raging Storms~
.@RRaging Storms@n

Another world?  Another dimension?  Ethereal?  Cold.  Wet.  Dark.  Chaos. 
Chilling winds gush down from the congregating mass of grey clouds above. 
Wispy tendrils of black air dance like snakes across the skyline, mixing
with the heavy, obfuscate clouds that hang in there and block sight. 
Rain pours down with unrelenting force.  Thunder pounds through sky. 
Bolts of lightning drop and jump lighting up anything close.  A moment
of silence.  A brief pause in the entropic thunderstorm that encompasses
all that is visible.  No sight of secure, safe land is visible.  Nothing
but the cold, falling rain.~

0 0 15 Ranger~
.Rangers are outdoorsmen and wandering types who operate beyond the
boundaries of society.  They feel at home with nature, and do not remain
for long in civilized parts, preferring instead to spend their days
surrounded by nature.

Due to this self-reliant streak, Rangers have a wide variety of skills
available to them, including a number of useful spells and several unique
abilities which relate to their experience with and knowledge of the
natural world.  Among these are the skills @CTrack@n and an improved version of
@CScan@n, which makes a ranger an invaluable scout and ally of any group, and
the spell @CTame@n, through which a ranger may befriend an animal encountered
in the wild.

Rangers make strong fighters, and while they do not have as wide a
selection of armor and weapons as fighters and paladins, they can deal
damage extremely well and stand in the front rank as a substitute when
necessary.

For a listing of spells and spells available to Rangers, please see @Chelp
Abilities@n.  Other help files that may be useful include @Cspell@n.

0 0 19 Ratkin Lair~
.In the underground realms that lie beneath many great cites these little
creatures thrive.  Sages speculate that ratkins were first created by a
sorcerer to be used as spies, thieves, and assassins.  Unfortunately,
they escaped and have spread throughout the realms.  Their nature matches
their creator's purpose; they are dark, malicious creatures, evil and
cunning.

Those that have the misfortune to stumble into a Ratkin lair describe a
twisted collection of corridors and boltholes, traps and blades in the
dark, adding to the horror.  The creatures are hoarders.  They steal and
collect all manner of junk, and hidden amongst 'treasure' is the
occasional bright bauble of some value.  Like raven and crows the Ratkin
seem attracted to shiny objects.

When enough gather together a larger, more vicious leader may arise. 
When this happens, the danger from these creatures dramatically
increases, as they become organized in their efforts.  Several townships
have had kidnapping's and murders at the hands of these cutthroats. 
These types of attacks only seem to occur when a lair has a warleader and
several bone shakers in it.

Disturbingly, several people have reported sighting a Ratkin possessing
magical powers.  Dubbed boneshakers, these creatures adorn themselves
with a mantle of finger bones and knuckles, perhaps using them in their
divinations and invocations.

It is recommended that on discovering a lair, a wise person will hasten
away, rather than take untold risk to explore.  However if one is braver
than wise, the library may be convinced to part with a sum of money
to anyone able to further information on these evil creatures.~

.The ratkin area has 60+ rooms, 33 rooms(aprox) are an ancient warren, a
ruined sewer and undercity complext that pre-date the ratkin.  Under the
ruins they have their lair, about another 27 odd rooms.
MOBS ***
Variations of ratkin include scouts, guards and boneshakers as well as a
leader type.  A vyan youth also works with them, his exact roll is
unclear atm Various rats and a few slimy eels and leeches cohabit the
lair with them.  The warrens have more rats, bats and a few large
insects, maybe some undead but unsure atm

recite <scroll_name> <target> 

@CDESCRIPTION@n

@ISome spells are written down on scrolls, and to access those spells,
one must recite the scroll.  Not all scrolls have targets; reciting a
scroll of magic mapping does not requre a target.

Note : recall scrolls have an additional, optional argument which can be
used -

recite recall <town_name> <player>

The effect is having the player recalled to the specific town; no town
name is required, though, and in that case, the default town will be the
town of that player's race.~

@CDESCRIPTION@n

This is used to create descriptions that players can reference by
typing look <name>.  Name may be a list of words that will work and before
each name a optional number is allowed specifying required number of 
characters that must match.  For example if you want look e to reference
an extra called east you would set name to "1 east".  Rdesc is the command
used to edit the text of the extra you are currently editting.

@CFLAGS@n

n : display relations table in numeric form

@CDESCRIPTION@n

The political relations between and among clans here are volatile and
dynamic, and are shaped by two key times: a natural proclivity toward peace
or war between two clans, and the actions of members of each of the clans
toward members of others. For example, Khedrun and Eleint are inclined to
ally, but continuous pejorative actions between the two will ultimately
plunge them into war.

The relations table show the following values, in descending order from
harmony to abhorrence:

        "+++"    Harmony     \
        " ++"    Accord       -  Peace
        " + "    Ease        /

some of the 'old gods', these are merely for familiarity's purposes.  For
details on the reasons for the changes, please read @C<help creation>@n.

Because of these differences in the gods, and the new importance religion
has, read carefully through the help files of the different gods before
making your decision as to who you might worship, if anyone.  Note that
priests, paladins, and monks must choose a specific religion prior to
level 5.  Note that none of the gods cater specifically towards certain
races or classes, though many may have large bases made up of their
followers due to the gods and followers matches in ideologies.

@BGods of Light:@n
@BAelyoni@n, Goddess of Nature and all that is green and verdant.
@BChandros@n, God of Justice, chivalry, and courage in battle.
@BDuroth@n of the Forge, God of the Earth and all that lies beneath.

0 0 0 Remort~
.Upon reaching @Clevel ninety@n, a player will be given a personalized
object with twenty-five free levels of affects.  The player will
determine at which level he wants to be able to use the item and what
affects he wants to be included on it, then it will be adjusted to fit
standards by the immortal in charge of objects.  The player will also be
able to determine what sort of item they want it to be, such as weapon,
armor, mana or regen item...basically anything that is a current affect
can be added as long as it doesn't exceed the number of affect levels.
The remorting player may also keep 50 platinum from their bank.

0 0 19 Renegade Dwarves~
.Spelunkers have reported seeing the furtive movements of diminutive
figures in the cave-riddled cliffs north of Chiiron.  The description of
the beings seen in the caves matches the description of a band of dwarves
cast out from their clans in the mountains of the north.  Adventuring
souls exploring the region claim that the dwarves have already dug in,
and are well prepared for any attacks.  There seems to be only one real
entrance into the caves they have claimed as their own, and it seems to
be guarded at all times.  Adventurers are advised to use caution when
approaching the aggressive outcasts.~

.~

0 0 19 Renegade Gnome Lair~
.The long-suffering citizens of Pennan have been weary of raids and
surprise attacks from ferocious invaders for many years.  Among the worst
culprits are a wild bunch of renegade gnomes.  These rogues and
cutthroats are skilled and dangerous, combining stealth, spellcraft, and
special equipment.  Rumors have been circulating that their secret lair
exists somewhere north of Pennan.  Those who wish to help rid Pennan of
these vile scoundrels had best be fully alert, for these gnomes are
well-trained in battle and dirty fighting tactics.~

.~

0 0 8 Rent~
.There is no @Crent@n at Legacy's Dawning.

You do not need to go to an inn to quit, or to continue playing to earn
money so you may safely rent.  Instead, merely use the @CQuit@n command. 
You may quit wherever you may wish, with a few restrictions (ie not while
during fighting, or in a town where you are wanted), and when you do so
your position is saved.  Any pets which you may have are saved where they
may be, your items, whether carried by you, in the bank, or on your pets,
are also saved, and all of your mail is likewise kept.

A word of caution - consider well where you quit.  A wandering aggressive
mob might be waiting for you when you return if you choose a dangerous
spot.  Towns are popular places to quit, and are usually safe.

0 0 6 Repair~
.@CSYNTAX@n

@Grepair@n <object>   : has the shopkeeper repair the object

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Players are able to preview the cost of the repair, but not all stores will
repair the weapon to perfect condition.

The cost of a repair depends upon several factors: the skill of the shop
performing the repair, the value of the item being repaired, the complexity
or rarity of such an item, and the condition of the item.

The abbreviations listed under condition are described below:

wls = worthless
dmg = damaged
vwn = very worn
wrn = worn
vsc = very scratch
scr = scratched
rea = reasonable
goo = good
vgo = very good
exc = excellent~

.@CMMORTAL NOTES@n

Objects have repair numbers which determine which shops can repair them.
The higher the repair level the harder the item is to repair, 10 is
impossible, 9 would only be by the greatest of craftsmen and 0-2 imply a
player with the appropriate skill (being worked on) can repair the item.
To set a repair level on an item use oset repair while to set it on a shop
the command is shedit repair.  You should keep in mind that the level
should be for that type of item.  So a wooden artifact might be 9 even
though it is much less difficult to repair than a magical sword of the same
repair level.~

16 0 25 Repair_Guide~
.@CHOW TO DETERMINE AN OBJECT'S REPAIR LEVEL@n

Repair works on a scale from 1 to 10.

Level 1 being the easiest to repair, 10 being the hardest (impossible) to
repair.

A shop that is set to repair to level 5 can repair anything from level 1
to level 5.

Only the absolute best armorers should be capable of repairing something
at level 9, and they should be extremely few and far between.

.A spell of no insignificant power, replicate allows the mage to harness
the mystical elements of the world to create an exact duplicate of a
specific item in his or her possession.  Through great effort and
concentration, the mage is able to bring forth matter where previously
there was none, and to bend unseen forces to his will.  The item copied
needs to be of a simple, nonmagical nature, and failure is always
possible.  A utility spell for experienced magi.~

This command is a method to tell to people whom you can not see or a

of using it unlocked for private conversations as if someone tells to you
just before you send your reply, the message may very well go to an

.This world of this mud is divided into several races which have a
propensity to war.  You have a reputation for each race.  If you attack
members of that race your reputation will drop.  Members include player
characters, guards, citizens, and shop keepers.  But races at war with
the race you attacked will approve of your action and your reputation with
them will go up.  To see your reputations type "reputation".  To see the
relations between the different races type "relations".  You should
be careful of attacking town guards as they will summon help if given the
oppurtunity.  A list of characters who are wanted by clan can be
shown under the command "wanted".  If you kill one of them and bring the

0 0 1 Request Ally~
.Through the ages, a mage has found his or her familiar to be more than
just a useful companion.  Often a mage's familiar has become an extension
of the mage.  Yet, limited by their small size, most were viewed as
nothing more than trained pets.  Such is no longer the case.  An
archmage, by tapping into planer magics, has been able to come up with a
spell designed to summon powerful allies that are more than just mere
familiars.  In order for this spell to be successful, it must be cast on
an item likely to have some special meaning or semblance to the desired
ally being requested.

These allies are said to aid only those of similar alignments.  Rumors
speak of the following allies having previously been summoned:

Allowed Fields = { 1_chance, 2_chance, 3_chance, rust, vnum, position,

@CDESCRIPTION@n

The resets have 3 chance fields.  When an area or mob is being reset, 3
dice are thrown.  If the first chance is accepted it checks on the second
and the same for the third.  If a chance is 0% it passes if the previous
roll passed.  A dice is rerolled whenever the reroll flag for that column
is set.  This is indicated by a * in the Rrl column.  The reroll flags
are set using a 1, 2 or 3 for the flag.

( The following is a brief explaination of how resets work.  Every reset
has a mob/object identifier, 3 chances and a set of flags associated with
it.  When an area resets, all rooms without players in it are cleared of
all objects except mob/player corpses.  The mud then runs through the
resets for the room.  Each reset has 3 "chances".  These are the numbers
switch for each chance saying whether the roll for this chance should be
rerolled when this reset is hit.
This implies that the first reset should have all 3 reroll stars set.)_

Object Flags:
  C)ontainer - Object is flaged as a container
  I)nside - Object goes in last object loaded with C flag set.

Mob Flags:
  L)eader - Mob is set as a leader
  F)ollower - Mob follows last mob loaded with L flag set.
  S)entinel - Mob is sentinel, this over-rides the species flag.
  A)ggressive - Mob attacks characters with no provocation.

0 0 8 Rights~
.This may seem like a strange catagory to have on a mud, but in dealing with
immortals Legacy's Dawning has some standard policies of what is allowable.
Realize that the immortals on the mud are donating their time and effort to
improve this mud.  And with the number of complaints, requests for help
that any immortal gets it is difficult not to become abrupt and ignore many
of them.

* You should always know which immortal you are dealing with.  An immortal
should not punish someone without going visible for at least a brief
instance.

* Immortals should not switch to mobs in an attempt to kill a player or
harass them.  Switching to a mob to amuse/confuse a mortal is fine, but
should be done in the spirit of fun.  If a player has found a bug to kill a
mob which they should not be able to kill, switching to the mob and killing
the player is not an acceptable solution.  Asking the player to stay away
from the mob and then fixing it is recommended.~

0 0 8 Roleplaying~
.@CRole Playing@n
@c---- -------@n

Role playing(@CRP@n) is when you act like your character you are
playing.  For example, if you play a troll warrior you act like a dumb
troll, you talk like one, fight like one, and do everything like one.  Or
if you are a rich noble you act like a snobby rich bastard, if you are
one.  RPing makes the game take on a whole new dimension you are no
longer just hacking and slashing you are truely living the game and it's
far more enjoyable than just hack'n slash.

To RP though you need to have a background for your character and a
detailed @CDESCRIPTION@n.  This will allow you to play a consistant
character and not confuse everyone.  Its a little tough in the beginning
as you round off the ruff edges, but once you get it going, you'll love
it.  Also, keep in mind, there is a difference between being a jerk, and
playing an evil character.  

So @CROLE PLAY!!@n~

16 0 16 Room.check.list~
.This is a @Creference only@n help file for builders.  Remember, our goal
is to create as realistic, interactive world as possible through text.

When creating rooms, be sure the following fields are set appropriately:

@CSize@n - Consider the setting of the zone.  Would you want elephants
running through a farmhouse?
@CTerrain@n - Terrain determines how much movement is used.  Make sure it
is appropriate to the setting.
@CFilename@n - so we can find your area file easily
@CRoom Name@n - See Help Room_names
@CLevel@n - Approximate level of a group that can safely run the zone.
@CHelp file@n - All areas MUST have a help file.  See @Ghelp area help
files@n for setting one up.

@CRflags@n that should be looked at on every room are:

Lit - Whether a room would be logically lit.  If not, do not set this
flag.
Underground
Indoors
Any flag for special rooms, such as banks, shops or altars
No.mount - Decide if you want players to bring horses and/or pets into
the rooms.
No.mob - Do you want wandering mobs to roam here.
Extras
Randoms
Leaving codes
Interactive acodes such as searches.

@CRoom descriptions@n:

Room descriptions should be a decent length (I'd like to see at least
five lines or more for each, although I @emight@n consider shorter if the
content is very good).  No three-liners will be approved.  Also, the
content of the room descriptions should allow for further exploration,
such as extras, searches, and any other interactive coding.  Please,
spell check and proof read each room description before asking for a zone
review.

@CExits@n:

If an exit has a closure of some sort, make sure that you can look at it
and see at least some small blurb in an extra about it.  If you look at
direction, it should be listed with the number one in front of the full
name of the direction.  Ex: 1 east rather east 'e ea eas'.  The 1
replaces all the shortened versions of the direction you can use.

4 0 16 Room.Names~
.The name of a room is a title and as such all important words in it ought
to be capitalized.  Room names should be a few words long, giving a
rough idea to the player where he or she is, and additional details may
be tacked on after a dash.

For example:

In the Tall Grass - By a Brook
Ant Tunnels
Dusty Trail
Trail Intersection - Foot of a Cliff

@CNOTE@n:

If rowhere -p isn't working correctly, or not showing something you know

sacrifice <item> to <deity>

@CDESCRIPTION@n

This command has many uses, the most important use is choosing a religion. 
Once you have found a god to worship, you merely sacrifice an item of
value to that deity to bring about his/her attention.  Sometimes an item
will cling to you, and you just can't find a way to get rid of it.  Going
to a holy, or unholy altar, and using this command to directly request
the power of your diety sometimes works in destroying the item.~

0 0 1 Sanctify~
.Sanctify is used to imbue a weapon or armor with the power of a deity. 
The effect is to cause the object to degrade more slowly - it
approximately doubles its lifetime.  The level of the caster determines
how good of a weapon or armor he/she can sanctify.  The scrolls of
sanctify are of fairly low level and are thus unable to sanctify the
better weapon or armors.~

.@IAs a fisherman from Chiiron trooped down to the beach one fine morning,
he found a very peculiar prize.  A tiny sprite, no more than two feet
tall, with bluish skin and bright green hair was caught in a long tangle
of fishing line, and a hook was imbedded in one of her little arms.  The
kind fisherman bent down to untangle the sobbing little creature and took
her to the temple of Taranth for healing.
@IThe wise priestess of Taranth healed the sprite's wounds and comforted
her.  The little elf-like sprite told how she had become lost in the
darkness while hunting for her missing school of angel fish.  After being
caught in a strong current, she ended up tangled in the fishing twine and
the hook had become lodged in her arm.
@ITo get her back to her colony, the priestess took the sprite to the
beach near Chiiron and pointed her in a south-westerly direction.  As the
sprite disappeared beneath the waves, her green hair was still visible and

trap will only work if you are a Thief, or a Ranger.  And the ease of
finding said trap is descending in that order.  So Thieves are the best
at finding them.  They are also the ONLY class that gains the ability to

though, the gnomes were seen fleeing the forest, battered and bloodied by
a large battle with a clan of evil dark faeries.  These faeries claimed
the forest their own as part of their new kingdom.  Upon finding out
about the neighboring sea sprites, the faeries quickly began building an
army because, in their eyes, these sprites were nothing more than a
nuisance.  Soon began the great faerie/sprite war which has raged for

0 0 19 Shattered Keep~
.Deep within the heart of the Dragonspire Mountains lies a crumbling,
shattered keep.  Within the bowels of this once mighty keep lies a sleeping
evil, a cold darkness native to the icy reaches of the Dragonspires.  The
keep itself was ripped from its true home centuries ago and placed here by
the beast, and now is inhabited by strange goblins with white skin, as
large as men.  The road to the keep is long and treacherous, as the
legendary yeti await the unwary trespasser, and tales of giant,
flesh-devouring worms which burrow into the snow abound from the few
adventurers who return from a journey to the keep.  Fragile ice bridges and
caves inhabited by fearsome, giant bats abound, and the snow is endless.
Let adventurers beware the wrath of the creatures which make their fell
homes near the Shattered Keep in the Dragonspires.~

@CDESCRIPTION@n

A custom is an item an item a PC may have specially made for himself or
herself.  i.e.  a "cap of feelers" requires the PC to provide a leather
cap and the feelers from the ant queen.  The PC brings the items to the
armourer, and for a price, the armourer will make the cap of feelers. 

shcustom - This lists all customs available in the room.  This command
may only be used in rooms where customs can be made.  i.e.  armourer,
magic shop.  

shcustom <object> - This creates a custom in the room.  Please note that
a custom can only be an existing object.  If the object does not exist,
you must first use ocreate to make it.

shcustom <object> cost # - This sets the cost to make the custom.

shcustom <object> <object_ingredient> - This adds an ingredient to make
the custom.  In the above example, the ingredients are a leather cap and
the ant feelers.

@CDESCRIPTION@n
    
This is used to set up a mob as a shop and set the types of things that
the mob will buy.  To 'build' a shop follow these steps.  
  
1.  mload the mob you want to be the shopkeeper.  A mob doesn't have to
    be a completely new type of mob - it can be one already used as a 
    shop-keeper.
2. reset mob  - to make it keep comming back 
3. shed new   - creates the shop
4. shed keep <mob>    - sets the shop keeper to the mob
5.  set the types of items for the shopkeeper to sell/buy: shed <flag>
    for each item type.
7. reset the items in the room: reset <item>
   Make sure you use @breset@n and not @bmreset@n.
And make sure you set the item's position to inventory 'reset # posi inv'.
8.  if you want the shopkeeper to be able to repair items: shed repair
<level> - where <level> is a number 1 to 10(10 being the most skill) 
  
Mobs gain and lose items as follows. Each reset every item that the mob
curently holds has a 10% chance of being removed.  So if a mob has 10
bells and 10 whistles chances are it will lose two items though it
doesn't have to, and they don't have to be one bell and one whistle. 
Every reset the mob will go through its mreset list and add an item if
the right 'roll' comes up.  So on average if you give a mob a 800 (mill)
chance of gaining an item it will roughly have 7 to 9 items at any one
time.  Note you can make a mob hold more than 10 (roughly) items by
giving it more than one 1000 (mill) reset.  

9.  Pet shops: Set rflag pet_shop.  Add shopkeeper as normal.  Reset pets
to be sold (must have a price AND must be tameable) in the room that is
ONE higher up from the shop keeper.  (Meaning that if your shop keeper is
in room 386, a "pen" or holding area for pet resets must be in room 387. 
) 
The holding area for the pets MUST be lit.~

0 0 7 Shinanne~
.@BShinanne@n - Goddess of Feasts and Harvests.

The goddess Shinanne is the Goddess of feasts and harvests, and as such a
shrine to her will be found in most settlements of at least a villages
size, to bless their crops and make them bountiful.  She cherishes life
dearly, and it is for this reason that she holds festivals - in order to
remind the more serious that life is to be enjoyed.  This attitude holds
her in great stead with the halfling people, for they are gourmet diners
and love the simple pleasures of life, food, wine, and parties.  While
all other races recognize her importance for harvests, few members of
them worship her as greatly and above others as the halflings.  Those who
worship Shinanne often pay tribute in the form of freshly baked tarts and
pastries or other food at her temples.

Because of her opinions towards an easy-going life, her and her followers
are often seen as lazy, but generally this is merely confused with an
easy-going, carefree style of life.  When it comes down to it, her
followers fight courageously against those who would seek to disrupt such
a life, especially the followers of Ghnomb, whose slavering trolls seek
to devour their harvests and destroy all that they have worked hard to
create.  Indeed, sometimes their regiments are ignored on the
battlefields in lieu of more obvious threats, only to become the deciding
factor.

Shinanne is said to often visit her followers, though seldom in a form
that they might recognize, preferring her anonymity.  When she does
appear visibly, she is said to resemble a rosy-cheeked matronly halfling
woman, with short braids tucked over her shoulders and wearing a
flour-stained apron.  In this form she often carries a rolling pin,
carving knife, or heavy skillet, which she wields with deadly accuracy. 
Her symbol is similar to that of many inns and taverns, where her
followers can be found enjoying a fine meal, that of a loaf of
fresh-baked bread beside a mug of frothing ale.~

well as minimum level and condition.  Most of the time, you can @Cbuy@n
items from the store by typing @Cbuy@n <object>, assuming you have enough
money to pay for it.  If you want to sell an item, the @Cvalue@n command
has the shopkeeper appraise the object, and then tell you how much he
will pay for it, and the cost to @Crepair@n it if it is damaged.  Then,
you can sell the item from your inventory by typing @Csell@n <object>.

delvers claiming to have gained access to a great ruin via a system of

0 0 7 Sindla~
.@BSindla@n - God of Luck and travelers.

Known to all as the prankster or trickster god, Sindla is a cheeky figure
that often roams the world in guises, causing (mostly harmless) mischief
and the occasional good deed to balance it out.  Thought of by most as
being some kind of odd leprechaun or sprite, his true form is actually
unknown to all but perhaps his most wily priests.  But despite his
appearance, he is thought to be a great traveller of the realm, and
offers protection to all who walk the paths of the world in search of
luck and fortune.

Due to their curious nature, a great many gnomes pay homage to Sindla,
the aspects of curiosity and luck fitting in perfectly with their natural
desires to roam and adventure, and to tinker with machinery and gadgets. 
Some gnomish priests say that their affinity with Sindla stops them from
having too many accidents then again; luck is always known to be fickle
and to run out when you need it, but its blessings are even more profound. 
A smattering of halflings and members of other races with an interest in
luck or travelling often find a home in his flock, and those who are a
follower of his often come to odds with the followers of Gzarth, their
lucky and curious nature often coming to odds with his stealthy and
cunning worshippers.

Though he appears rarely on the realm, he is said to appear most often as
a face in the crowd before a lucky roll of the dice, or as an
undistinguishable humanoid traveller of small size, often decked out in
gaudy clothing and riding a spotted pony, or carrying a banded travelling
staff.  His symbol, well known to his followers, is that of a spinning
golden coin, sparkling with light and splendour, which often appears not
only on the more traditional temples, but on shrines of his in gambling
houses, and travellers way stations such as inns.~

32 0 19 Sjerdil's Tower~
.@CDESCRIPTION@n

The elder gnomes of Orlumber have many fond memories of their childhood
years.  They remember sunny, playful picnics in the Rua Valley and
wonderful, finely crafted toys made by the renowned toymaker, Sjerdil,
whose untimely end is still a mystery.  From one day to the next the tower
Sjerdil and his family called home transformed from a friendly, welcoming
refuge for children of all races and ages, to a grim, dour dwelling
forbidden to all.

Through all the long years since, travelers and adventurers have avoided
the mysterious location, until recently when a group of explorers,
unfamiliar with the area around the place, stumbled across it.  What
happened to the unlucky troop is vague, for the lone survivor of the trek
speaks of it with terror and half-mumbled sentences whose meaning is
unclear.~

.@CGuidelines for Writing Socials@n

@ySocials@n should tell what the actor does, did, or is doing.
        should not tell what other people do in reaction.
        should distinguish between what actor sees and what others see.
For example, gnomes do not see their owns hands as small.

Do not add obscene socials (fart, pee,...)
Editors found doing these will be de-socialized.
Limit each social to one color code.

@yBasic steps to writing socials:@n
TEDIT NEW <social table name> <social name> to add a new social.
TEDIT <social table name> <social name> to edit an existing social.
     Example:  tedit new soc.elf laugh
     You generally will only be able to edit socials of your race.
TSET or TSTAT to see the fields of the (new) social.
TSET <social field> <entry> to set various fields.
      Example:  tset ch.self You laugh quietly at what $N did.
      Example:  tset position resting

Typing TSET POSITION, TSET AGGRESSIVE, TSET DISRUPT, TSET REVEAL will
show the various possible entries for these fields.

You can add as many different socials as you want.

TEDIT SORT <social table name> sorts the socials alphabetically.
     A social must in the right alphabetic position before it's "doable".
WRITE TABLES will save your new socials and changes.
TEDIT DELETE <social table name> <social name> to delete a social.

To see other tables and socials for hints, ideas, TEDIT <social table

when resting, standing, fighting, etc., but not when sleeping.

the social to a mob, it will attack you.

0 0 15 Sorcerer~
.Encased in darkness and despair, the sorcerer applies death and
destruction to the world, spreading hate, fear and death like a plague
across the light lands.  Empowered by the dark gods and elder demons,
they attack the mind, body and soul of those unfortunate enough to cross
them.  Distaining combat abilities, they focus instead on furthering
their black arts, drawing them closer to the demonic forces upon which
they call.  In their final hours upon the world, some have been able to
transform into an undead mage, enabling them to continue their evil works
in the form of an arch lich.

Although often beautiful, the new continent holds a dark secret, a sect of
evil creatures who have delved into the dark teachings of the unholy three,
and in dedicating their lives to them, have gained the powerful magics from
beyond the grave.  Sorcerers can only begin in the new world, where the
teachings have been hidden until the discovery.  The township of Tar'ippal
still holds one of their lesser masters.  Seek that one out for assistance
in stepping onto this darkest of paths.

spoison( char, stat, save, modifier, affect );

@CPARAMETERS@n

char - The character to poison.
stat - The stat to reduce. @Y(See help stat type)@n
modifier - the maximum modifier to apply.
save - whether the target gets a save or not. (1 = yes, anything else = no );
affect - a character affect to attach to the poison, will only function
with normal poison ( stat = none ) 

@CDESCRIPTION@n

This will afflict char with a custom poison.  When used in conjunction
with thief poison skill, the duration, level, and strength of the poison
are dependant on their skill.  In this case modifier can be used to make
this particular poison more or less deadly.  When used in any other code
modifier will determine the poisons strength.
Save should be set to no on thief poison (the routine already has a save
built in), and usually yes on any other call.

@CEXAMPLE@n

spoison( ch, str, -5, 1 );
Will afflict char with a poison draining -1 to -5 strength.
OR
With poison skill, this will make the thiefs poison -1 to -5 points stronger.

spoison( ch, dex, 10, 1 );
Will have no effect
OR
With poison skill, this will make the thiefs poison 1 to 10 points weaker.

0 0 7 Sslissist~
.@YSslissist@n - Father of Dragons and all who bear scales.

Basking atop a warm, sun-heated boulder in the depths of the swamps lays
the domain of the Father of Dragons.  Sslissist, as he is known in the
mortal tongue, is the lord of all creatures that bear scales, but is only
openly worshipped by some of the more intelligent creatures, like the
lizardmen and naga who pay homage to him.  As a god, he seeks to remain
neutral in all things, caring only for his scaly creatures, including the
dragons of the realm, which he sees as his sacred children, and the more
intelligent ones, though they may not worship him formally, acknowledge
his presence and pay the respect he deserves.  He is seldom worshipped by
members of other races, though those that do have a heavy, and perhaps
unhealthy, interest in his creatures.

Certain members of the pantheon consider Sslissist to have somewhat of an
elevated view of his own self, but they are of course mistaking his lack
of interest in the foolish gods around him for the simple joy of existing. 
Followers believe that all creatures have a right to exist and to live as
they choose.  Followers take comfort in knowing that those who are evil
and those who are good tend to balance out in the end.  He realizes that
the death and life of creatures is in the natural order of things, so
understands when a lizardman hunter must slay a python for its meat,
skin, and skull.  However, he does take it personally when creatures slay
those who worship him, be they lizardman, naga, or dragon alike.

Though it is not well known what this elusive being truly looks like, and
his priests certainly do not divulge this secret, it is thought that he
most likely appears as his symbol in the lands, that of an ash grey
dragon, resting on a boulder of smooth obsidian.  This symbol appears on
the battle standards of many a lizardman warrior, as he charges into
battle to avenge the wrongdoings against his fellow tribesmen.~

0 0 1 Starving Madness~
.Using the insanity of the starving beast, the sorcerer invokes a rage of
hate and fury in a target.  Unable to control their aggression, they
launch a furious attack upon any perceived foe.  In such a bloodlust, it
is often impossible for the raging creature to defend or even flee from a
battle.  Upon the spell's end, the target finds themselves incredibly
hungry, requiring a bountiful meal to satisfy their cravings.

0 0 21 Stronghold_rules~
.This helpfile clarifies a few rules about strongholds that is not
discussed in help strongholds.  Be sure to check this list regularly, as
more regulations or frequently asked questions about strongholds may be
answered in this help file.

@CThematic Restrictions@n:
I will be strongly enforcing the theme of your stronghold.  What this
means is that if you are an evil, secret society of assassins, you will
not be allowed to build a cheerful castle of white stone near Chiiron. 
This includes locations as well.  Dark-themed strongholds will not be
allowed near or in light towns without @Bextreme@n cost or in-character
reasons.  The same applies to light-themed strongholds, which will not be
allowed near or in dark towns.

Note that for the purposes of determining which towns are considered to
be dark or light, Medienne is considered a light town while Sos-kul is
considered truly neutral and either set of races can build nearby.  All
other towns should be fairly self-explanatory.

@RMobs in Strongholds@n
Mobs will be allowed in strongholds, but with the following list of
restrictions: 

@C*@n No trainers.
This should be fairly obvious.  No mobs that can train skills will be
allowed inside strongholds.

@C*@n Restricted shopkeepers.
This means that no shopkeepers in your stronghold may purchase items,
custom items, or reset with any items in their inventory that you do not
provide.  This means that if you had a bartender it could only sell items
that you gave to it.

@C*@n No private hunting mobs.
This means that you can have no mobs which would provide a private
hunting grounds for your clan.  No mob in your stronghold may skin for
anything or reset with any items in its inventory that you do not provide. 
Any mobs in your stronghold may not be killed.  Violating this rule is
considered a very serious offense.

@C*@n No wandering/aggressive mobs.
Your mob may not leave the stronghold under any circumstances.  It may
not be aggressive, although it can block players in the case of a
guard-type mob.

@C*@n No tameable mobs.
No mobs in strongholds can be tamed.

Examples of allowable mobs would be:
A small white cat which roams around your stronghold.

A hulking troll guard which guards your treasure pile, blocking any who
try to approach.

No prices are provided for mobs in strongholds, as they will be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis.  But note that more complicated mobs will be
increasingly expensive, although even the smallest mob will be quite
expensive.~

0 0 21 Strongholds~
.                 @yThe Dwarven Labor Union@n
      @yPrice List for the Building of Clan Strongholds@n

@C*  @nThe basic clan stronghold consists of three rooms and your clan
insignia.  Flat rate for this is @G350k@c.

@C* @nA basic locked door and key comes complimentary with your clan
house.  However for those of you who would like a little more secrecy,
you can add a hidden entrance to your clan house.  The price of this
added feature will be between @G15k@n and @G50k@n depending on how
elaborate you want to get.  Additional locked, non-secret doors are
priced at @G15K@n.

@C* @nExtra rooms leading up to a Stronghold will be priced at @G25k@n
for the first two rooms, then @G50k@n for each room after that.

@C* @nSecret rooms will not be part of the basic three rooms.  To create
a secret room, you will be charged @G100k@n for an extra room as well as
an additional @G50k@n for the concealment of the door and hidden lever.

@C* @nStorage rooms and banks are inclusive and are available for your
stronghold at the cost of @G100k@n for the flag, with an additional
purchase cost of @G100k@n for the room itself.  These rooms save over
crashes/reboots, and do not reset.  Items will stay indefinitely either
on the ground or in chests, should you choose to purchase them.  Large,
300 pound capacity chests are priced at @G3.5k@n and 1000 pound capacity
chests are priced at @G10k@n each.

@C*  @nAdding arenas to your stronghold is also possible, at a cost of
@G100k@n for the extra room plus 100k for the arena flag.

@C*  @nExtras in the room, such as pictures on the wall you can look at,
will cost you @G10k@n per description.

@C*  @nWhen you're relaxing in your new Stronghold or having an important
meeting, you may want to have a few tables, chairs or couches for you and
your guests.  The price for a basic piece of furniture will be @G5k@n,
but if you want some exotic custom item, it's going to be charged at a
custom price.  (Such as a throne or a dragon leather couch.) 

@C* @nFor those of you who would like a fountain built in your
Stronghold, the charge is @G50k@n for materials and labour.  Soup
cauldrons will also cost @G75k@n for stocking and labour.  Note that
there will be no fountains containing any special liquids, such as youth
potion, taengle wine, as it is beyond the skill of the dwarven laborers.

@C*  @nActions, such as 'You smell a delicious aroma waft up from the
kettle of soup,' will cost @G25k@n per action.  Note that elaborate
actions may cost up to four times the normal rate, dependant on their
complexity.

@C* @nExtra-Planer placement, The charge for this is high as it takes an
extreme amount of arcane energy to accomplish the task.  The cost is
@G500k@n for a new stronghold to be placed on its own plane and @G750k@n
for an existing stronghold to be 'transported'.  @RThis is not available
at this time@n.

If there is something you would like for your clan house that is not
listed here, please ask about it and it can be submitted to the Union for
consideration.  However, Dwarves being the practical creatures they are,
please try to keep your requests within the bounds of reality.

0 0 17 Study Opponent~
.Warrriors, as they advance in the art of combat, learn their opponents
are constantly broadcasting signals about their next move or their
fighting style.  They learn how to read this body language to defeat a
creature of any race.  Going into a berserk rage cancels the benefit of
this skill.

This skill allows the monk to temporarily stun the opponent for one round,

0 0 19 Sulfur Marsh~
.Under the blanket of the mountain beeches the damp ground gives way to
marshlands that are noted for their pungent aroma and large frog-life. 
Poachers often ply their trade around the swamp, seeking food and skins to
trade to near-by Talidars.  Competing with the poachers are feral
lizardmen, a small colony of the wild creatures hunting and gathering
through the marsh lands, their prey the giant otters that scamper through
the ferns.

0 0 1 Summer Touch~
.Enhancing the heat of summer the druid is able to direct a fiery blast at
a single target.  As this spell harness the power of the sun, both heat
and light, it works well upon undead.
~

.~

0 0 1 Summon~
.With the upheaval of the godly pantheon, this spell, once a potent magic,
has lost some of its power.  The spell mystically transports a target to
the location of the caster.  Even in its weakened condition, this spell is
still fairly reliable when successfully cast.  Clerics around the world are
augmenting the power of their distant gods with summoning stones, thus
allowing travel throughout the continent.  Research is underway regarding
the possibility of finding stronger reagents to allow for trans-continental
travel.

@CNote@n: To be summoned by a cleric, you must be intro'd to them and
have them consented.

~

.~

0 0 1 Summon Cadaver~
.The first offensive pet in a sorcerers spell list, this incantation uses
the black arts to summon an undead minion to serve the sorcerer. 
Reasonable at combat, the undead does its best to follow simple
instructions.  This spell can be used in conjunction with @Rskull watch@n. 
As with all undead pets, a wise sorcerer avoids certain townships when
leading a pack of dead.

The skeletal minion is rumored to be summoned with a simple polished bone
shard.
~

.Effect -- summons lvl 20 skeleton pet
Reagents -- Book of Dark sumons, Shard of bone (consumed)
Resist -- Nill
cast_message A skeletal minion rises to server you!
~

0 0 1 Summon Corpse~
.After years of the draining affects of 'Body Snatch', sorcerers were
capable of improving on the spell.  While the range has yet to be
expanded, the drain on the caster is lessened greatly.
~

.~

0 0 1 Summon Undead~
.Summons forth a powerful undead minion to serve its master.  Unlike the
summon skeleton spells, this calls forth the first demonic undead, a
great winged bat-like creature.  Wreathed in unholy energy, the bat can
inflicted both magical and mundane damage on its victims.  Calling forth
such a creature is not without some sacrifice.  A sorcerer must be
willing to shed both his own and others' blood to complete the evocation. 
Because of the dangers of controlling such a creature a sorcerer cannot
summon undead and skeletons at the same time.
~

.Effect -- Summons a lvl 25 flying demon bat, has physcal and fire attacks. 
This spell replaces skeletal pets but not skull watch 
Reagent -- Blood human heart (consumed) -3d10+100 hp fire inflict damage to sorcerer
Resist -- Nill

necessary to enter any water region.  This skill is automatic.~

.@CSYNTAX@n

switch <familiar> : switch into your familiar's body

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Switch is the command used by mages to operate their familiars.  While in
their familiars bodies, mages will 'see' things from the familiar's
viewpoint, and will or will not have infravision, detect hidden, etc.,
according to the familiar's senses.  To return from a familiar to one's
body, the command is, logically enough, @creturn@n.~

.Mastery in swords is the second of the blade dancer's disciplines of war. 
Knowing every aspect of the weapon allows them to incorporate the blade
as if it were part of their very being.

16 0 19 Sylfaen~
.@GSylfaen@n | vnum (unassigned as yet)
Creator: Teircen

The elven woods.  Actually, per request, this is to be a rather large
zone.  I can forsee having to break it up into more than one zone to make
it make more sense.  Within the woods there are two elven settlements. 
The larger high-elven city, a bastion of elven magic, politics and
culture and the smaller wood-elf village, a quiet abode in tune with
nature and concealed from prying eyes.  The high elven village will
contain a library, alchemists, a temple and city-style shops.  It will
not contain spells commonly attributed to elemental or nature magics,
that has fallen to the wood-elves.  A fair comparison would be city-folk
and country-folk but in elven terms.  Being somewhat xenophonic, the
elves have not cut trails into or out of the woods and only the natural
animal trails facilitate travel.
However, these are not the woodlands of the elven homelands and this
forest dose have its darker side.  Rabies is not unknown in the animals
of the woods.  Animals both sick and twisted to the darker forces dwell
here in conflict with the more peaceful animals the elves are accustomed
to living with.  Poachers frequent the woods in search of game.  A fallen
ruin deep within the woods contains twisted powers of necromancy and the
occasional ghoul finds its way into the lush foliage to plague the local
elves.

== Elves born of this region, having lived and grown here and being elves
by their nature, will have an easier time traversing the woods.  If there
isn't a way to cut the travel costs for them and rangers in woodlands,
then I plan on putting some shortcuts in that only elves, ents and
rangers can find and/or lead others through.

=== Architectural styles will be different.  High elven city will be
fluid curves of smooth stone, crafted by the aid of magic.  The wood elf
village will be natural wood, branch, leaves, mud, etc.  The elements of
nature carefully sculpted over years to bend with the forest.  Ents don't
have a town, being at peace with the woods and more reclusive.  On the
occasion they do need to visit a shop, they deal with the elves.

Objects: A great many common objects in the cities.  Many mundane objects
in the woods that serve no purpose except that they would/should be there.

Mobs/NPCs (I will list the cities in seperate help files).  Squirres,
Rabbid Squirrels, Rabbits, Fawns, Raccoons, Rabbit Raccoons, Doe, Stags,
Grimfangs (a snake type), Gnelms (cute litte good-elf-friendly npcs dark
types may enjoy killing and providing elves future quests), A type of
gremlin, poachers, ghouls, wolves, direwoves, snakevines (corrupt plant
type), giant spiders, and more as yet undetermined.  (birds, etc) 

Shops: Towns to be posted seperately.  I'll probably place a small
outpost with a shop or two on the westernmost edge of the forest. 
Basically the elven trading post with other races so they don't have to
deal with outsiders in their inner sanctum.~

.~

0 0 20 Syntax~
.This mud expects a syntax of input slightly different than most muds, which
can be confusing at first.  There are special characters that must be used
in conjunction with certain commands to either distinguish between items
with similar names, or do an action to multiple items.

There are many objects in the mud that have almost identical names.  For
example, if you have a short sword and a long sword in your inventory,
typing 'look sword' might not look at the correct sword.  To look
specifically at the long sword, you would put a period in between the words
of the object's name.  So, 'look long.sword' would look at the long sword.
If you wanted to @Cbuy@n a soft leather jacket and not a hard leather jacket,
you would type 'buy soft.leather.jacket'.

Often, you will want to do something with many of the same type of item.
To get, give, drop, @Csell@n, or @Cbuy@n many of the same type of item, you would
use the '*' character in front of the object's name, in the form
x*<object>, x being the number of that object.  For example, to drop 10
copper pieces, you would type 'drop 10*copper'.  To buy 3 wooden shields,
you would type 'buy 3*wooden.shield'.

The prefix 'all' is also used.  To sell all the skins in your inventory,
you would type 'sell all.skin'.  HOWEVER, 'all' can be used in two ways.
To get all the objects from your bag, you would type 'get all bag'.  But,
to get all the bags in the room, you would type 'get all.bag'.~

0 0 7 Tairae~
.@BTairae@n - God of white magic and of the moon in the heavens.

As Aelyoni is to nature, and Chandros to the sun, Tairae is often thought
of as being the silvery moon, glowing in the night's sky.  He is the god
of white magic; all that is not perverted about spells and casting.  His
magic is also often associated with cold, the clarity and chill of the
ice similar to the simplicity and purity he tries to portray in spell
casting.  He is most often followed by the high elves, due to their
influences in magic and the world around them, trying to keep the peace
and quality of essence alive.  He also has some followers from the other
light races, who agree and live by his methods of magical teaching. 
Seldom is a mage of the dark races concerned with keeping magic pure,
more often than not they seek to corrupt it to enhance their own personal
power.

Like Chandros, many of his followers like to think of Tairae as being the
moon, circling through the night's sky and watching over his people.  He
is also loathed, though not as much as Chandros, by the dark races who
would choose to attack during the darkness and still of the night, and
have such a plan disrupted by the silvery chill of the moon, disrupting
the perfect blackness that reigned.  The followers of darkness also
detest his holy magic, which at times thwarts their attempts to rule
unchallenged.

When Tairae chooses to appear before his followers, which is not often,
as he prefers to stay aloof and somewhat separated, leaving his people to
do his bidding, he appears as a tall, elven man, dressed entirely in
silvery silk, with a circlet of ice on his brow.  His face is often
painted with runes and markings in the same silvery colour, and his short
blond hair hangs loosely to his shoulder.  When he appears at other
times, it is as a comet or a shooting star, his omen to the world, which
to those who follow him, is said to have special meaning.  His symbol is
that of a silver crescent moon, rimmed with ice, trailing a shower of
silvery sparks.~

0 0 19 Talidar's Marsh~
.Talidar's name for the swamp was originally the swamp of the blue waders,
however since he was the only one from the new township that seemed to
spend any time within its muddy waters the swamp quickly became known as
Talidar's marsh.  Years of farming and road building have almost
quartered the swamp's size from the days of Talidar's wanderings.  These
days the little corner of wetland plays home to the blue-feathered waders
that use the swamp for food, shelter and nesting grounds.  Rumours abound
that Talidar hid a large sum of treasure somewhere in the marsh, marking
its spot with a rune that a careful observer may spot.  In all the years
of the township's existence no one has managed to find the fabled
treasure, some putting it down to myth and others to Talidar's cunning.

16 0 19 Talidar's Spire~
.Tales told in the Red Fox Inn tell of the founding of the humble village
of Talidar's spire.  The story itself is a winter's favorite, its length
growing with each passing year, as are the deeds and trials that Talidar,
the town's founder had to face.  Although most of the tale is lost in
myth, some still rings true.

Talidar was a monk of Slen who was often wandering, as he would say,
before disappearing into a dark hole or similarly dangerous place, "off
to test the will of Slen and see how lucky I am today".  After many years
of Slen's blessings, the monk (often called the 'mad' monk) arrived in
the northern lands of heavy forests and rolling hills.  It's said he fell
in love with the land and its wilderness, marveling at the beauty he saw.

At that time long past, most humans lived in the warmer southern lands,
only a few brave souls had made the journey to the northern frontier.

One day while wandering, Talidar saw a beam of sunlight break through the
pendulous clouds that had hung overhead for days and shine upon a spire
of stone, rising above the black beech forest.  He hastened to the spot
(here the story seems to be in disagreement, some people tell of
Talidar's companion, an elven woman whose name is lost to time, spotting
the spire while Talidar was asleep, waiting for his dinner to cook).  It
is not wise to mention this version to the good patrons of the Red Fox -
not unless you have a few coppers spare to calm a loud and agitated crowd.

Nevertheless, on investigation of the spire, Talidar discovered the
symbol of Slen (the spinning coin) carved into the rock.  The writing was
ancient and weatherworn, dating to a time when legends walked the lands. 
Talidar was convinced that he had found a holy site and at once began to
construct a temple to honor Slen at the spire's apex.

After several failed attempts (Talidar was not a carpenter), the temple
lay in bits at the base of the spire.  Trusting in luck, Talidar decided
he would journey to the southern lands and hire an army of faithful
followers to aid in the construction of his grand temple.

Talidar spent over a year wandering the northern lands (by all accounts
he was completely lost) until he stumbled upon a small dwarven hunting
party.  Talidar immediately set about convincing these new allies (as he
saw them) that they should journey with him back to the holy site of Slen. 
Now normally the dwarven peoples are not followers of Slen, preferring a
more solid and dependable god, but as luck would have it a young scout,
named Khahindar, was moved by the monk's words and decided to accompany
Talidar on his quest.

And so Talidar's wanderings continued for many years (some say five,
others over a decade).  As he journeyed, so did his band of followers
grow and Talidar lead them all back to the spire.  (The exact number of
followers seems to grow with each recounting; the latest number being
above three hundred, but this seems unlikely).

At last they reached "the promised land" around Slen's spire (as it was
called in those days).  The temple to the goddess of luck was raised at
the top of the spire, and indeed, it seemed as if Slen's blessings were
upon the land.  The surrounding forests were laden with animals and fruit
that provided wood, food and skins.  The rich soil underfoot was perfect
for the growing growing crops, and the ample warm days of summer and
rainy winters to fed the land.

Nestled around the spire, the village grew and flourished for many years,
until at the end of one particularly harsh winter, news was brought to
the village from the temple.  Talidar had died in his sleep at aged one
hundred and twenty seven.  (Do not bother to dispute his age, it just
makes the locals demand even more ale from your now dwindling purse).

In honor of their founder the villagers renamed the spire Talidar's Spire
and eventually the village and its surroundings absorb the name as well.

Present day:
The village is well situated, nestled in the forest hills of the northern
lands.  Crops, such as apples and pumpkins, are shipped with wood to
places such as Ceanshire, and even as far as the southern cities. 
Especially valuable are the white teak trees that are found throughout
the area, sought after by furniture makers and other craftspeople for its
ease of shaping and its fine grain finish.

Apart from the occasional wolf or bear, the village is relatively
peaceful.  Several retired adventures have made their homes here, adding
their talents to the village.~

0 0 19 Talonwood~
.Long ago the llewyrr of the Vaasa came upon a lesser developed tribe of
goblinoids.  The tribe of goblinoids were very primitive and were
persecuted, even by other goblins.  The llewyrr took pity on them and
gave them refuge in the vastness of the Vaasa.  The llewyrr called them
tasloi, an ancient elven word meaning "wood goblin", and began to teach
them how to survive in the woods.
   
Things went well for a few brief years, then the tasloi turned on the
llewyrr.  What started as spiteful pranks by the tasloi grew until it
came to all out war.  In the end, the llewyrr hunted down most of the
tasloi and managed to chase the rest out of the Vaasa.  Enough of the
tasloi survived to form small bands, and every few decades a population
explosion seems to occur and the llewyrr are plagued by tasloi hungry for
elf flesh.  Recently they tasloi seem to have learned to hide from even
the vigilant llewyrr scouts and rangers and have taken to using ambush
tactics.  This time, they have made it further back into the Vaasa then
ever before and the llewyrr are becoming concerned.
  
The tasloi live primarily in the Talonwood to the southeast of the Vaasa. 
Both the tasloi and many of the other denizens of the Talonwood are quite
dangerous.  Most scribes agree you should not attempt to enter before
level 15, the ones that didn't agree thought you should wait even longer,
but who ever listens to scribes these days.~

0 0 1 Tame~
.Tame is a ranger spell allowing the caster to tame a wild animal.  A tame
animal will become the pet of the caster.  The profiency of the caster
will determine how readilly a animal will accept being tamed.  Generally
the skill only works on woodland type animals, and some creatures are
just too strong willed to be tamed.  A frog, skeleton or insect is
impossible to tame, but a rabbit or bear or other animal is possible.
You can only tame a number of animals whose total levels are less than or
equal to your level of experience.

Remember, implicit in the tame spell is the idea that the ranger is, in a
sense, befriending the creature.  Rangers cannot, nor would they, gain
the trust of a creature only to betray it, sell it, or otherwise abuse
the spirit of such a creature.

Remeber, also, that not all pets are welcome in all towns.  Some citizens
of certain towns loathe certain animals and will attack them on sight.

0 0 19 Tar'ippal~
.Starting town/ruin  and accompanying zones for dark newbies.

Historians and archeoligists tell us that Tar'ippal was originally
created by what they believe to be an ancient breed of dwarf which has
long been extinct.  After the destruction of the old continent and the
relocation of the races, this city was assimiliated by the goblins who
were the first to find it.  They instantly fell in love wth the hot tar
pits that flow through the caverns once mined by the ancient dwarven
peoples.  They quickly named the town Tar'ippal and will now fight for
it, if it ever came to that.  One black-skinned goblin was overheard
stating that the tar has done wonders for its skin.  Though one look at
him, any sane person would say otherwise.~

0 0 7 Taraskatt~
.@RTaraskatt@n - God of Plague and disease.

Taraskatt is the god of plague, disease, and pestilence.  Pure evil,
darkness, and shadow are the domain of the Black Unicorn, who is a
subtle, pervasive god whose powers are vast and attacks are difficult to
defend against.  He relishes inflicting not just death but torture to all
his victims, there are few things worse than seeing yourself rot away. 
Diseases aren't just objects or things to Taraskatt, they are his living
children who need to grow, feed, and reproduce just like all other life
must.  What makes him evil is the comfort he takes from watching his
'children' thrive while its host creature writhes in restless torment. 
But such is the way of life for him; the weak will perish while the
strong survive.

Taraskatt is a part of the Ebon Triumvirate, with his brothers of Khalmor
and Xharax.  Their roles all vary, but Taraskatt's current agenda is to
raise a new plague, a horde of beasts and worshippers to sweep across the
land and destroy all in its wake.  To this end, his greatest enemies
among the light gods are Halina, goddess off life, Chandros, god of
justice, and Tairae, the god of white magic.  He recruits any evil-minded
creature that wishes to serve his purposes, making no discrimination
between the races if they are willing to serve his ultimate goal.

When Taraskatt appears as an avatar to his people, it is as one of two
forms.  A non-descript human male, known as the 'Peacock King' whose
appearance differs, as this visage is often used for infiltrations
purposes.  His other form, the one he uses most often to strike fear into
the hearts and souls of his enemies, is that of the Black Unicorn, an
ebon masterpiece of the traditional champion of light.  As such, his
symbol is that of a wild-eyed black unicorn, its front left hoof raised
high, ready to begin the march.  Forward the Unicorn!~

even @cgrouptell@n, tell is a private channel which only includes
yourself and your 'target.' Use of tell thus enables you to have secure

To list the most recent 'tells' which you have received, type 'tell' with

looms above the swamps, looking out over the nearby Northern Sea.  Flying
from the highest parapet of the fortress, a black banner stirs in the
wind; the battle standard of Ri'lahl.  A silver octagon inscribed upon
the midnight silk of the standard embraces an argent falcon, positioned
to strike.  The embroidered raptor's eyes seem to watch the land around

straight line rooms.  The terrain is mostly grassland and rolling hills... 
going into plains, with forests copses.  Glances the river a few times.. 
and the junction is south of the large forest north of Ceanshire.

The distance from Talidar's Spire to Dun Tathaig is approximately 60
straight line rooms.  The terrain is rolling hills, grassland, some
sparse forest.

The distance from Ceanshire to Marnlee Heath is approximately 110
straight line rooms.  The terrain is grassy plains and craggy hills, like
the valleys of scotland.

The distance from Sslak to um..  other cities is going to be by raft by
some methods (perhaps with the outcast island en route).  Otherwsise, we
can set up one path from one city over land and swamp.  Not sure how many
spaces, I leave that up to the map-makers..:) I'd like the path to be

.~

16 0 5 TFE.Building.Guidelines~
.@bRoom Names@n - Are similar to titles and should be capitalized as such.

@CRbugs@n - Use these.  If you no_mob a room, make it safe, or set an
unusual rflag, add a permanent rbug.  It saves time later in case of
problems.

@CMob treasure/items@n - Mobs should have logical eq and treasure.  A
rabid dog, or a shambling mound should not reset with coins, for example. 
Think of what a mob would logically use, and not just what would be a
'neat' item, when doing resets.  Helps the realism angle.

@CArea Layout@n - Long and unrealistic strings of rooms are *bad*.
Ideally, players ought to be able to move in all directions at all times. 
If you don't want to build something to the north, come up with a
legitimate (or semi-legitimate, at least) reason why they cannot move in
a direction - a rushing river, a steep cliff, a thick wall of brambles,
*something*.  In any case, avoid long awkward paths - these will become
deathtraps once pkill is in.

@CAnachronisms@n - Anything which undermines the illusion of this world
should be avoided.  Cutsey jokes may be funny the first time, but after a
while they lose their humor and just detract from the roleplaying
environment.  Jokes that are in-character are better than good, but
comments about real life are out of place and time and therefore
inappropriate.

@CItem Resets@n - Do not reset items of any significant value on the
floor of rooms.  Even if guarded, eventually someone will be able to kill
the mob, quit, wait for repop, and repeat the process over and over to
get multiples of the item.

@COriginality@n - No ripping off others' ideas.  Period.  We want all
original ideas, and while we're operating within a genre which owes a lot
to certain sources, let's not parrot back what's already been done.  Be
inspired by something, but take it somewhere new.  'Nuff said.

@CShopkeepers@n - These should be HIGH level, and have a summon function
with at least a 50% chance of summon each turn.  They should be able to
see invisible, detect hidden, and be resistant to poison and sleep in
order to foil players' constant attempts at larceny.  Armor shops should
not reset  above studded leather, with the exception of banded armor
in Kha-Da, and weapons shops' stocks should be comprised of bronze
weapons, with a few bits of iron and NO steel or + weapons.  This is an
adventure game, not an excursion to the mall.  Good items should be rare
and found in out-of-the way places, thereby giving incentive for players
to explore and take risks to get them.

@CProprietary Items@n - Certain items can only be found in certain places
in certain areas, and players have to go on a mini-search for them.  Be
careful not to reset such items elsewhere.  Before you reset an item,
make sure you know where else it is found, and whether your reset would
undercut a previously designed area.  When in doubt, post on the imm
board.

@CRepair levels@n - set these on items.  Make them > 3 unless you want
players repairing the item once the repair skill is implemented.

16 0 5 TFE.Mob.Checklist~
.@CSYNTAX@n

no syntax, this is just an informal help file for newbie immortals :)
ubj = "Use Best Judgement"

@CDESCRIPTION@n
 
Following will be a short check list of things to check as you go through
your mobs, to make sure they are complete...
 
level : make sure level is appropriate for area (must be determined
        first) look at similar mobs and set to same level - ubj
hitdice : should equal level (check "help standards" )...fyi, hitdice 
          is the HP on a mob or player(damage player can take)
sex : use best judgement
clan : if mob is meant to be killed unlike human shopkeepers, townfolk
       or whomever, the they should not be set to secomber...i.e.,
       (if killing mob is considered murder in RL, set to secomber)
race : check similar mobs or use best judgement
size : use best judgement
alignment : usually if aggressive, set to evil (but not always...ubj)
mvdice : you don't need to set for a regular mob (horse or such...yes)
    Use mset move ...
coins : look at similar mobs, most mobs won't give much (or any) coins
stats : compare to other mobs, ubj or ask another imm.
resistances : there is a help file, but compare to other mobs (or ubj)
long desc. : use your imagination (but don't make too long)
keywords : if you see unique words in long desc. add them here
main desc. : aim for at least 3 lines long...the longer the better :)
mflag sentinel : stay in room
mflag stay_area : if not sentinel, then have this flagged
mflag summonable : makes mob capable of being summoned by a fellow clan
                   member who has "summon" in their mpcode
mflag has_skel : determines whether the corpse is 'animate dead'-able
mflag wimpy : do you want it to flee during fight?
mflag can_tame : most mobs won't be tameable, ask upper imm.
mflag humanoid : if looks like human (else, see marmor)
mflag aggressive : will this mob attack player when they enter room...ubj
mflag warm_b : if you don't know, ask another immortal
mflag all others : use best judgement (don't go overboard on affects)
marmor : see help file on it...
mpcode : look at my "help standards" file...fyi, mpcode is the attack
         code the mob "performs" on players
  
otherwise, that should be enough, if i left something out...then ask
around...if you follow this, your mob should be fine...although the first
players to kill it won't get experience points until the mob has been
killed a few times.
 
Hope this helps! Enjoy - Dragos~

16 0 5 TFE.Rdesc.Standards~
.Room descriptions are just that: @bdescription@n.  They are not
narration, they do not tell stories, give players history, gossip, or any
information which they could not obtain from standing in a spot and
examining their surroundings.  It is the players' job to make inferences,
even the most basic, and put together the raw data.  Rdescs assume
nothing.

Rdescs define rooms; they are the firmament of Legacy's Dawning, and
should only include the @bpermanent@n traits of the room.  Referring to
an ogre's breath in the next room is not appropriate in an rdesc; if the
ogre is killed or out at the local sports bar, this descriptive detail
would not make sense.  [This example would be more appropriately handled
as an action which used the mob_in_room function to check if the ogre was
present in his lair.] Similarly, things like weather conditions, time of
day, etc. are equally inappropriate.

Rextras should be provided for prominent items in the rdesc.

Room descriptions should not have players @bdo@n anything.  This rule can
be violated in extreme cases (perhaps sensing some trepidation entering a
cavern full of bones) but generally you should never write "You feel
happy as you walk through the beautiful woos." Why?  Have the real
person, in real life, become happy from your prose; show them that their
character should be happy, and they will be, tell them to be happy and
the rdesc rings false and sounds awkward and canned.  Similarly, rdescs
describe - having a player *do* anything in one is no good.  This is
where actions come in; use them.  If you don't know how to code
something, ask for help.

@bCover the basics@n.  Always remember that your first job is to give the
player a handle of his or her situation and his/her immediate
surroundings.  Where is the player?  What does he see?  Where may he go? 
This is the job of the rdesc, first and foremost.

Any questions or suggestions for improvement on this rough, please let me
know.  Thanks.

16 0 5 TFH.Armor.Decrepit~
.@YDECREPIT ARMOR@n
@CARMOR STYLE: MELTABLE@n

Decrepit armor is designed solely for the use of popping on mobs to
provide meltable metal armor to players without resetting the kind of
stuff that players would normally want to wear (aka: Avoid the gluttony
of ringmail/scalemail/chainmail that trolls, dwarves, barbarians, etc. 
provided...  Virtually nobody customed metal armor unless it was
platemail/plate armor...  this is going to change.) 

@YIMPORTANT INFORMATION@n

Decrepit armor should almost always be rusted, the more the better.  Set
rust to at least 99-100% on mobs that reset this.  The armor is wearable,
but the AC and durability is but a shadow of the customed versions.

This armor is designed to be what players melt in order to custom the
metal classes of armor, from banded to plate armor.  Reset this armor
wisely.  In lower level areas, it should only reset on
chief/bodyguard/sentry type of mobs, and not 100%.

Higher level areas may use this as a more common alternative to leather
objects, but do not have an area load metal armor 100% on all mobs... 
Metal is supposed to be VERY RARE these days, players should not be able
to make custom metal armor without considerable effort on their part.

.@YGENERAL GUIDELINES WHEN MAKING OBJECTS@n

When creating a new object that is an improvement over a base item (or
creating a whole new class of object), use the following charts in order
to determine the item's level.

@YAFFECTS  (oset affect x)@n

@cbase stat@n (str, int, wis, dex, con):  +/- 20 levels per stat point.
@cresistance@n (cold, fire, poison, electricity, acid): +/- 1 level per 1%
@cstatistic boost@n (hit point, mana point, move point): +/- 1 level per 2 change
@cregen boost@n (hit regen, mana regen, move regen): +/- 2 levels per .1 change
@cccombat boost@n (hit/damroll) +5 for 1 level, +15 for 2 levels, +25 for 3@n
Do not use age, armor, or mind...  As of now they do nothing, and no
benefits to level will be given when using negative amounts of these.

@YOFLAGS (oflag x)@n

For the most part, oflags will be evaluated on a one-by-one basis.  As
far as I can tell, Jacob's help file @coflag_levels@n should still apply,
but I want to avoid having very many permanent-effect objects.

In general:

Making an item class or race-specific will reduce its level.  Try to
avoid too many of these, however, unless we can keep a good balance
between classes.  Making an item alignment-specific (good/neutral/evil)
will reduce its level.  As above, try to make sure the overall scheme of
things is balanced.

@YCUSTOMS:@n

Customs automatically enjoy a 5-level 'freebie' boost to compensate for
the difficulty of creating such an item vs.  popping it.  Custom items
should also weigh slightly less than normal (subjective), or contain
other benefits.

Most customized armors should be custom.fit to compensate for racial sizes.

0 0 19 The Black Wastes~
.Ancient legend tells of a great land known as Tarik Nor.  The oft told
tales were thought to be just rumor until recently, when a band of
adventurers stumbled on a barren tunnel, leading to a deserted landscape
that scholars now believe is Tarik Nor.  The land is described as a vast
wasteland completely devoid of all wildlife, plants and water...nothing
more then a flat, featureless plain.  Reports from several other bands of
adventurers tell of a forest which lies deep inside the waste but further
exploration was blocked as unseen forces seemed to push them away.
Scholars and sages have researched the land deeply and have found that it
was once part of a major trade route that linked Pennan, Medienne and
Chiiron with exotic supplies and crafts.  The last expedition to travel
into the wastes was never heard from again.  What truly lies inside the
land of Tarik Nor is unknown but legends speak of a marvelous city from
which riches of unbelievable magnitude were bought and sold daily.  Those
wishing to travel into the land are told to seek the northeastern most
section of the Dragonspire mountain range but many sages warn that the path
is dangerous and death lurks around every corner in this forbidden land.~

.~

0 0 19 The Chamber of the Aspects~
.Deep within the northern parts of the Pennan hills lies a place of great
mystery and secrets.  Tales from adventurous wanderers claim that great
powers roam beyond a dark and sinister cavern.  They also claim that some
devout followers of a strange religion reside within, fiercely guarding
those powers.

0 0 19 The Great Icalah Tree~
.Explorers tell of the discovery of a ancient, old tree in a forest of
prickly porcupines.  The tree is of a type never before seen in the realms
by these intrepid travelers.  After much discussion, all of it sober, of
course, they called it the icalah.  Each discoverer took gifts of fruit and
cuttings from the tree, before dispersing and vowing never to speak of the
strange, flying creatures in the tree.~

0 0 19 The Rift~
.An innocent was slain, and as her life's blood poured onto the stones on
which she lay, a terrible curse was cast, and a rift opened linking this
world to the underworld.  Hordes of evil ghosts and wraiths press
forward, sensing the passage, hungering to escape into the living world. 
The spirit of the innocent herself guards the rift, but who knows when
she might fall?~

.~

0 0 19 The Ruins of Kah'slai~
.With the opening of Calidar's Harbour many new travelers have managed to
make the arduous journey to the new world, leaving Dulthor's Hold
sometimes never to return.  As the new lands are explored further some of
their ancient history has begun to resurface.  One such site is the ruins
of the elven city of Kah'slai.  The city once stood across the high
cliffs of the southern coast but years of abandonment and the
ever-consuming sea has torn much of the ruins down, leaving the
water-swamped remains for brave explorers to reclaim.

0 0 19 The Vaasa~
.A place of great beauty and mystery, the ancient forest known as the
Vaasa is home to some unique and magical creatures.  With its towering
Shuvana trees and being rife with forest life, anyone who ventures around
would fall in awe of its splendor.  Rumors insist that the llewyrr make
their home around the area.

The Woodworms (level 8-20)
  
The woodworms are a well-known and much feared menace of the Vaasa. 
Their depredations are responsible for the death of several venerable
shuvana trees.  Though feared for the swathe of destruction they can
cause, slowly devouring tree after tree, many elves have taken it upon
themselves to champion the cause of the woodworms' downfall.  With
vigilance and constant hard work, the elves have managed to keep the
destruction of the woodworms at a standstill.  Should you seek to join
these noble guardians of the woods in defending the Vaasa, then ask any
llewyrr in that vast woods, and they will probably be able to lead you to
the very spot where this battle against this foe is waged.

The ancient elven city of Vaasa lies deep within the heart of the forest. 
(See help towns for more information.

@RWARNING@n: Rumors persist that the vaasan elves hold little welcome to
those of non-elven heritage unless they are accompanied by an elf, are an
ent or have joined the Shuvana Guard.  Whispers speak of jails and dank
pits well on the edge of elven influence.

.Once thought to be deserted, the Theatre in the Hills near the town of

was closed by a lack of funding, several performers from around the world

The new manager, thought to be a rich businessman from Pennan, reportedly
has thrown several hundred platinum pieces into remodeling the Theatre in
the Hills from its dilapidated state into a prospering theatre house. 
Unfortunately, rumor has it that the theatre was so badly out of shape
that his restoration fund was barely enough to open the theatre and pay
for some cheap actors.~

.Thieves are the dregs of society, never having learned how to make an

sneaking around, peeking here and there, picking locks to break in and
enter, and stealing anything that may be of any use or worth.  The
ability to spot traps and disarm them, coupled with their ability to
@Csneak@n, and @Chide@n, make thieves notoriously difficult to find or
detect.  Should the opportunity arise, or should the situation require, a
thief will never hesitate to plunge a dagger into a foe's back.  After
all, as one famous thief was heard to say, "It does not matter how subtle
the wizard, a dagger in the back will cramp his style."

0 0 17 Thief_Poison~
.People who deal in the black market often also deal in lethal items,
particularly those you use to poison a weapon, food or drink with.  There
are few with any skill in the craftmanship, but they are said to hold the
secrets tightly amongst themselves.  If you can find someone willing to
teach you in the crafting and application of poisons it can have many
different affects, depending on what you use to make the poison with. 

There are many different types of poisons, all with different affects,
although through much effort it has been determined that a person can
only be affected by one type of poison at a time.

.,------^------,
< Tirath Regnus >
`------v------`
Duroth claimed the mighty spirit of the striped-socks king (Soiran I)
just after Dartanian shook the mountains, driving the goblin hoards back
to the depths of the Gilmil's Heel (Calyn Rift).  A great celebration
ensued among the dwarves of Lonilan - the horde invasion averted, the
striped-socks king taking his place beside Duroth - there was much
merriment and joy such as dwarvenkind had never seen.  Firebreather
flowed free through the streets of Lonilan and the twelve drums,
accompanied by the beardless prince's (Soiran II) breath-pipe players,
belted out the sounds of victory.  History remembered this day as the
Feast of Dartanian - traditionally dwarves wear striped-socks on this
feast day. It remains, to this day, as the only high feast the beardless
breath-pipe players play.

The beardless prince charged Drolm Dromli of the dwarven labor union with
the task of constructing his father's final resting place.  A spot was
chosen within Tirath Regnus - home of the High Priest of Duroth and
ceremonial burial place for the warriors of Lonilan.  Miners tripled
their ruby and diamond output - the colors red and white being the royal
colors of the line of Soiran.  Carved within the hard brown mountain
stone of the tomb were larger-than-life sized images of the striped-socks
king, complete with diamond encrusted armor set right into the stone.
Golden thrones, chariots, goblets, vases, candelabras - almost anything
gold could be molded into - were all placed within the tomb.  When all
work was complete, all the warriors of Lonilan clad in full ceremonial
garb gathered within the tomb to witness the final sealing.

The high priest of Duroth buried Striped-socks, clad in his newly-polished
battle gear - consisting of a black steel breastplate inset with diamonds
and rubies, a black circular steel shield with Soiran's royal crest
engraved upon it, a black steel cap with horns taken from the alpha male of
a mountain ram colony, and (the centerpiece of the collection) his sturdy
axe -- the very piece of equipment which separated him from other warriors.
Many dwarves spent uncounted sums money to get the master smiths of Lonilan
to forge them an axe of great power.  Striped-socks however, forged his own
blade at the age of ninety-one.  It fell short of all the standards lain
down so long ago by the Blacksmith's Guild.  It was unbalanced - had a
wooden hilt rather than the preferred iron or steel - and no carvings or
frills master smiths are so apt at decorating with.  Yet striped-socks took
great pride in it.  To this day it has dealt more deathblows than any
other... all dealt by the arm of striped-socks.~

0 0 19 Tomb of Harand-da~
.In an age long forgotten, hordes of orcs roamed the great fields of the
west, where now small human villages have come to flourish.  The orcs
pillaged where they pleased, took what they wished, and grew strong and
powerful as the elves roamed their forests far to the east, and the
dwarves lay resting in the cold stone mountains of the north.  But the
orcs grew restless, and came together in a great army intent on
overthrowing the dwarven fortresses of the Cairn Mountains, even unto
Kha-Da itself.  Harand-Da, the One-Handed, mighty hero of the dwarves of
the line of Khedrus, First King and founder of the Clan Khedrun, rallied
his dwarven kinsmen and met this great dark horde in the fields just
west of the Bridge of Tears.  The battle was long and bloody, and many
are the bardic tales and songs of the heros and villains who made
their names with axe, hammer, and scimitar.  Finally the orcs made a
final charge, breaking the ranks of the seasoned dwarves and smashing the
armies of Harand-Da against the stones.  But Harand-Da would not
surrender.  He too led a final charge, rallying the scattered dwarves and
meeting the orc advance upon the Bridge of Tears itself.  The charge
destroyed the orcs utterly, sending the few survivors that could run,
fleeing back across the great fields of the west and into the deserts and
barrens beyond.  Sadly, the day was not without its losses.  Scores and
scores of dwarves, both old and young, fell in the victory.  Harand-Da
himself took an orc spear in the heart as he stepped over a clansman who
had fallen.

Harand-Da was laid to rest in a place of honor in the heart of the Cairn
Mountains, above the tomb of Khedrus himself.  Others who had fallen in
the battle were lain as honor guards, left to rest in peace for all
eternity.

It is said they will only awaken when the ancient evil of the lost race
of Western Orcs, the Durgoroth, returns to endanger the mighty halls of
Kha-Da once again.~

@C[Chiiron]@n
@c[Humans: Secomber]@n

The city of Chiiron lies a few miles west of the Sea of Stars.  This city
is the primary home of the humans in this region of the realms.  Although
it started out as a trading post, Chiiron quickly grew to be a thriving
community and welcomes all light races.  Chiiron is also the starting point
for many new and brave adventurers.

@RWARNING@n: Chiiron does not tolerate those of evil intent.

@C[Medienne]@n
@c[Humans: Secomber]@n

Medienne was once a thriving merchant community until a long and deadly war
with the neighboring elves ravaged the city.  The city has slowly begun to
rebuild itself to its former glory but is also in constant danger due to
the nearby forest and graveyard filled with many dangerous creatures, both
living and undead.  Despite its hazardous locale, many adventurers call
Medienne home due to its tolerance for both light and dark races.

@RNOTE@n: Medienne is tolerant of all law-abiding citizens.

@C[Darkhaven]@n
@c[Dark Races of evil alignment]@n

Darkhaven is the small underground city that serves as a home to the most
evil characters of the realms.  Many humans, vyans, ogres, trolls and the
like call this city home due to its hidden location.  No light race has
ever ventured into the city and returned to tell what lies beyond its
closely guarded gates.

@RWARNING@n: Darkhaven is tolerant only to those of evil intent.

@C[Pennan]@n
@c[Humans: Secomber]@n

Pennan is a sprawling farming community a few miles west of Chiiron.
Surrounding the city, lush green hills serve as grazing grounds for the
local farmers' herds.  Pennan is under constant threat of attack by an
active band of renegade gnomes and marauding hobgoblins that lie
dangerously close to the village's outskirts.  Pennan is known for their
superior armorsmiths which have setup shops and make finely crafted armors.

@RNOTE@n: Pennan is tolerant of all law-abiding citizens.

@C[Kha-Da]@n
@c[Dwarves: Khedrun]@n

Nestled deep inside the Cairn Mountains lies the dwarven stronghold known
as Kha-Da.  The city is home to superior dwarven armorsmiths and
weaponsmiths.  A few dwarves call this city home as is it so isolated that
it rarely has any trouble from the nearby monsters.

@RNOTE@n: Kha-da is tolerant of all law-abiding citizens.

@C[Brithbarad]@n
@c[Orcs: Azak]@n

Brithbarad is a large orcish outpost several miles north of the Black
Hills.  The outpost is surrounded by grassy plain regions, home to several
varieties of dangerous animals.  Many dark races, in addition to orcs, call
this city home, due to the tolerance the orcs have for other races which

@c[Ogres: Karse]@n

Located in the side of the Dragonspire Mountains, this ruined town was once
a thriving human settlement.  After several brutal battles, the ogres of
the land slaughtered all the townsfolk and claimed it as their own.  Since
then, it has grown steadily more decrepit and ruined.  The main home for
ogres, the town also holds a tolerance for other dark races.

Little is known about this elven city for only a selected few of
non-elven heritage have ventured into it.  Those that have seen it have
come back to tell about its beautiful view overlooking the Vaasa and its
marvelous construction.  Hidden among the trees, only elves seem to be
able to find its extremely well hidden locale.  @RWARNING@n: Rumors
persist that the vaasan elves hold little welcome to those of non-elven
heritage unless they are accompanied by an elf, are an ent or have joined
the Shuvana Guard.  Whispers speak of jails and dank pits well on the
edge of elven influence.

Most would call the Kss'sk swamp a dark, dank place where only fierce

not as advanced as other races, the lizardmen pride themselves upon being
able to live in such an unforgiving enviroment.  The city lies far to the

trolls serve them well by guarding the city from the intrusion of the
hated light races.  The city, itself, faces few threats from outsiders. 
Whether this is due to its location or the inhospitable location no one
has ever determined.

them.  Don't be afraid to ask NPCs(non-player characters) about skills you
want to learn.  Please note that a teacher for a particular skill of one
class may not teach that same skill to another class and that one can be
trained in a skill only up to level 7.  Further increases in skill level

people.  Though the troglodytes seem to have no real tendancy towards good
or evil, they are cerainly a nuisance.  Several troglodytes have managed to
make it to the surface, only to pray upon animal and sentient being alike
with a sheer, bestial brutatilty.  If the safety of the Vaasa is to be
preserved, the noble guardians of the Vaasa will have to turn their
attentions within and prevent a full uprising of these strange creatures.
   
The few Llewyrr that have ventured into the dark, dank layers come back
with odd tales of strange sites.  After much consultation between the
noble guardians, they ventured the comment that they felt the troglodyte
menace could be controlled.  They felt the troglodytes served about the

At least until recently.

Travellers from Medienne to Denab-Khur have found bloodstains upon the
Great North Road and have found some few personal effects of an ill-fated
merchant caravan.  The Watchers of Voaleth have also reported some
missing persons and scenes of combat without any bodies.

Rumors abound about a new chieftess that has given the clan a new
purpose, about a new breed of troll that breathes fire, and also that
they are taller than frost giants.

Be wary, traveller, for there are worse things in the night than
pickpockets, and yet beware of rumors that could play you false and
separate the fool from his money.~

0 0 10 Trolls~
.@GAverage Statistics for Trolls@n

Height: males about 6'4" - 7'4"
        females: about 6'6" - 7'6"

Hair: Swamp trolls tend to have black hair, not always on their
      head.  What hair grows on them is either greasy or coarse.
      Ice trolls of the north have white hair, with at least
      more on their head than elsewhere.

Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.

Affiliation: trolls are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic
neutral alignment.

Appearance: Trolls have green skin in a variety of hues (though none are
what would be called vibrant, verdant, bright, neon, or electric green). 
They are often warty or have cancerous appearing growths, though these do
not seem to affect their health negatively in any way, rather it appears
to be an excess product of their ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost
never have any scars, as they heal so incredibly well.  For a race that
is typically foul, corrupt and evil they have incongruous gift of
incredible regeneration but it comes at the cost of a never-ending hunger.

Ice trolls tend to have duller, paler skin that is typically dry.  Their
hair is coarse and bushy.  Swamp trolls tend to have darker shades of
skin and greasy, sparse hair.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Troll@n

Trolls are known to be big, slow lumbering behemoths whose sole goal in
life is to feed their never-ending appetite.  Fortunately for them, just
about anything short of stone is considered edible and their metabolisms
are quite happy to oblige in that regard.  While an uprooted shrub or
forgotten bit of clothing makes an adequate snack, the best food is
something you just killed yourself.  While some trolls have finally
managed to figure out that skinning an animal might provide fur you can
sell for even better tasting meat, most still prefer to just eat the
corpse outright.  After all, not much tastes better than a fresh kill
whose blood is still warm.  The fact that you just killed it yourself,
somewhat sating an almost equal appetite for destruction is just spice for
the flavoring.

Two varieties of troll have developed in the realm, though both races
share a few common characteristics.  Hunger, the ability to heal, and a
complete loathing for sunlight.  All trolls prefer the dark of a nice
cave to the painful light of day.  They also all share a deep-rooted fear
of fire as it has the ability to harm them and is about the only thing
likely to scar a troll.

Swamp trolls are the more common variety when seen at all, tending
towards solitary life.  They are fairly anti-social, even among their own
kind and like to live under the exposed roots of large swamp trees or
under bridges.  They are quick to anger, quick to kill things, and
insufferably monotonous.  They are poor conversationalists with
communication skills often extending at best to grunts and simple
gestures.

Ice trolls, also called northern trolls, are found primarily in the upper
Cairn mountains and, infrequently, in the Dragonspire mountains.  Unlike
their swampland cousins, they share a common social structure and tend to
live in small familial groups in the mountain caves.  Though they still
share a fairly low level of communication, they are at least known to
have a limited vocabulary making them seem leaps and bounds ahead of
their swampland cousins.  Ice trolls tend to be more intellectually
advanced, which still isn't saying much, heartier in survival, but
smaller, weaker and less brutal in comparison to their cousins.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Trolls are typically a solitary breed, though they rarely fight with
other trolls when they do meet.

Vyans are considered untrustworthy schemers, though useful allies in dire
circumstances.

Goblins are only useful as lackeys and servants.

Orcs make useful allies and fair-to-middling hunting partners
particularly when the quarry is elves.

Short of other trolls, ogres make the best companions as they share the
trolls' lack of love for conversation and their love of carnage.

Elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings are despised as legions of light
and order as much as their tendency to get in the way of a good meal. 
Fortunately they, themselves make excellent meals.  Provided they didn't
bring fire, one meal is as good as another.

The best thing about ents is provoking them.  After all, they look so
much like trolls that they must be related.  Trolls just can't figure out
what's wrong with them that they serve light and goodness.  As they are
typically slow to anger, trolls get great mirth out of trying to convert
ents.  A lack of vocabulary simply means this usually take the form of
offering ents ample bloody meals, which they invariable refuse.  The look
of tormented sadness in their eyes as they consider the harm you caused
to living beings in obtaining the meat is about as much fun to see as it
is getting the meat in the first place.

The best thing about humans is the fact that they keep building bridges
to hide under and most of them are too weak to harm a troll.  The end
result is that they build trolls fabulous homes then pay them to walk
over them and if they refuse to pay they try to cross anyway making a
never-ending supply of meals that come to your very own front door.  The
occasional human turns to the dark side and makes for an interesting
hunting companion as they can be quite inventive in their destructiveness.

reraise undead by investing more energy in trade for the fact that undead
don't heal), wimpy off (they don't fear damage, won't flee).  include
Undead in keywords.  Marmor should be according to logic.
  
@CZombies@n:  fill zombie slot with their own mnum (can be reraised)
          fill skeleton slot with a skeleton (you can always rot the flesh off)
For zombies attached to mobs, set their level = 1/2 donor mob, however,
set the stas of said zombie to those of a mob = 1/3 the donor mob.
Set to slow (unless donor mob was fast), has_eyes on (they have them),
Infravision on (low_level sense life).  They are the lowest level of
undead and not immune to much, so low level fire / cold resist, slightly
better electrical resist.
     Damage done by zombie should follow standard mob damage for a mob
of its level.  The form the damage takes should roughly follow that of
the donor mob.  (If donor mob had 2 claw attacks and a bite, downsize to
less damage or maybe just two claw attacks, etc.  Use your best judgment).
Often it is easiest to start by just dropping any special attack the
donor mob had.

            fill skeleton slot with their own mnum (can be reraised)

don't set to fast unless donor mob was fast to begin with.  Has_eyes off,
Infravision / See_invisible on (effectively sense life).  Slightly better
defense of fire/cold/elec then similar zombie type.
     Damage done by skeleton should follow standard mob damage for a mob
of its level.  The form the damage takes should roughly follow that of
the donor mob. (If the donor mob had 2 claw attacks and a bite, downsize to

@CWHAT ITS ABOUT@n

Occasionally, a change will be such that we (the immortals) can't decide
a proper direction to take, so the vote system was implemented.  Your
votes may very well affect the course the mud takes.

@CExamples@n

vote (with no arguments brings up a list of polls, their results, and
whether they are still open or not.

vote <pollname> (no category argument) brings up the list of categories
you can vote for 

vote <pollname> <category> will register your vote, you only get one vote
per poll.

So take the poll Shield.Spells for example.
vote Shield.Spells will bring up a list of these categories and how to do
it.

It will list these options:
@I@IAllow.Similar.but.No.Opposites
@I@INo.Similar.or.Opposites

.In an old abandoned mine shaft near Voaleth, explorers have found a cavern
with a huge door set into the north wall.  Finely wrought of mithril and
steel, the door was unable to be opened.  Upon hearing of this find,
Tsarith, Master Sage of Voaleth, sent word to Etrahnin of Pennan.  A codex
Tsarith had translated only days before told of an entombed force of guards
protecting the final resting place of their nobles.  Perhaps, this door is
the entrance to the tomb.  Only the sages know what lies beyond.~

0 0 10 Vyans~
.@GAverage Statistics for Vyans@n (aka Dark Elves)

Height: males about 4'8" - 5'8"
        females about 4'6" - 5'6"

Hair: typically straight.  Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.
      Extremely rarely brown or blond.  Vyans have no facial hair.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      violet or amber.  Other colors, such as brilliant blues or
      anything from gray to black are also not uncommon.

Affiliation: vyans are a dark race and restricted to evil and chaotic
neutral aligments.

Appearance: Vyans look much like humans though they generally have a
smaller, more slender build than humans.  Vyans tend to have smooth
unblemished skin ranging from midnight black to pale, wan colors and
ashen castes.  The vyan with the healthy glow of sun burnished skin is
almost completely unheard of.  Despite their apperance as a result of
living primarily underground for countless centuries, vyans tend to
possess a beauty to equal that of elves.  Their dark beauty has drawn in
many an unwary victim who later fell pray to whatever schemes the vyans
were planning.  You probably won't see wrinkles on a vyan before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice for a few hundred more years.  Vyan hair
typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a
thousand years of age, if at all.  Like elves, vyans have upswept,
pointed ears.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Vyan@n

Vyans are a haughty race, indeed perhaps the most haughty of all races. 
They will refer to themselves as vyans or simply as The People, as they view
any other race as chattel to be used or destroyed at a whim and with no
more remorse than if they were objects.  They believe it is their
divinely given right to rule and they very nearly manage to succeed.

If playing a normal vyan, it might be suggested that you imply that you,
or another vyan, is the undisputed leader of any group you are in.  If
anyone disputes this you should probably follow them into the nearest
playerkilling zone and kill them or have a loyal minion kill them in your
name.  After all, it is divine will that ordains your rulership.  Just
don't confuse leadership with tanking (being the one who takes all the
hits in a group).  That's what sturdy minions are for, preferably ogres
and trolls, who are just big dumb brutes adapted to taking such beatings.

Vyans hate to be called dark elves.  Once, long ago the elves and the
vyans may have shared common ancestors, but the elves have proven to be
weak fool relying on the good will of life where they should accept their
role as an elder race along with the vyans and rule through power.  Long
wars have developed due to the rift in elven and vyan philosophies and
there is no hope of a peace ever developing now.  To call a vyan an elf,
even a dark elf, is to imply that they are weak and foolish.  Ideally
only other vyans should be permited to even speak to you, however, on
those occasions when a minion must speak with you they should refer to
you as master.


@yRacial Relations:@n
As the only true people, vyans view every other race with some measure of
contempt, though some more than others.

Trolls, Ogres and Orcs make good minions and cannon fodder in a fight.

Goblins are a nuisance best destroyed unless you have raised them from
birth to be subserviant slaves.

Humans, while occasionally producing a few dark-minded folk who can serve
as good as ogres, trolls and orcs, are primarily still pretty useless and
are better destroyed than ignored before they get lucky and find some way
to cause trouble.

Dwarves, halflings, and gnomes typically serve the force of light and
should be destroyed outright as they are meddlesome nuisances.

Elves have become the bane of vyan existence.  These close cousins embody
all the weak, pathetic ideas that the vyan nation finally overcame and
cast off.  An unending war has raged for countless centuries between
these two races that emobody the paths of light and dark.

Ents, as servants of the light and close allies of elves are hated, but
only about as much as one could be said to hate a dangerous animal.  They
are dangerous, but they aren't really people.  If not for the fact they
aid the elves much in the same way ogres and trolls are of use to the
vyans, ents would be a concern that could be left off for a later, more
convenient date.

@CAmmunition@n      @Glevel of ammunition / 4 + 4@n @I@I@I@R1d@n

Level 1 weapons are treated as level 0 for standards purposes.

@CDice Progression@n

Every 30 levels the damdice get moved up 1.

For example a level 1 dagger, with no specials.
0/2+6=6 max damage for it.
Then take max damage and divide it by the number of damdice it gets.
So 6/2=3.  So damage is 2d3 for a level 1 dagger.

@COpcode Specials@n

These are treated on an individual basis, but in general you take the
frequency * max damage of the special, and reduce max damage of the
weapon by that amount.

So for example, a random of 1 to 10 == 4 is 10%
If the special maxes at 70 points, you get 70*.1 = 7 points off max
damage.

Wear opcodes will usually count for nothing.  They are just pretty.

.------
Entanglement spells softcode balance formula is currently as follows:
Hitpoints = (spell_level+L)*((mob_stand_dice+mob_stand_dice/2)/2)
calc out that mob_stand dice manually and round generously
since the formula doesn't accept decimals
eg web = level 17, so its (17+L)*x
looking at mob standards, a level 17 mob gets d10 hitpoints, so its
(10+10/2)/2 = 7.5 so rounded up to 8 
so (17+L)*8 works

@cDESCRIPTION@n

The @Cwho@n list will list all players who are visible and online.  Each player
is placed in a category according to how well you know them.  The first
category is self-explanatory: @cImmortal@n.  The @cbefriended@n category will list
all people who are on that are @cbefriended@n to you.  The @cknown@n category lists
people who you are introduced to but not @cbefriended@n.  The @cunknown@n category
lists people who you have not been introduced to.  Each player can only
appear once on the who list, so someone who is @cbefriended@n will not appear
in the @cknown@n category.

@cDESIGNATOR THINGIES (TM)@n

You may notice two letters after a player's information, these may be one of:

0 0 1 Wilderness Lore~
.The final spell in a druids' movement bases circle. Wilderness lore
greatly increases the targets ability to move through the land with
little effort and delay.  As a side effect the spell draws energy
from nature, often this is enough to slow a targets need for food
and drink.

0 0 20 Wimpy~
.@CSYNTAX@n

wimpy                   : list current wimpy settings.
wimpy <field> <% value> : sets your wimpy to a % value of your max hps.
wimpy <field>           : resets the %value of that field to zero.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Wimpy causes you to flee when your hit points go below your wimpy % value.
You will attempt to flee automatically, so remember to turn it off at the
appropriate times or it could get you into more trouble than whatever good
it may do.  Your maximum wimpy % value depends upon level and your maximum
hit points.  Note that wimpy is @CNOT@n failsafe, and comes with no ironclad
guarantees, but it's usually better than nothing.

The available fields are @CFlee@n, @CBlink@n, @CRecall@n and @CPray@n.  When your hit
points go below the % value of a field, you will attempt to either flee,
recite a scroll of recall if you have one, or cast the spell 'blink' if you
are a mage.  Again, this is not failsafe, so be warned.

0 0 1 Winters Gale~
.A more powerful winter spell that strikes a foe down with ice and wind. 
Unlike the first winter spell the effects only last a single round.
~

.~

0 0 1 winters touch~
.The onset of winter can be felt by a chill in the air and frost upon the
vegetation.  The druid is able to emulate the feeling of winter in this
spell.
~

.~

0 0 12 Wither~
.Those well in tune with nature are able, at times, to call upon it to cause
their mortal enemies to wither and die.  This high-level spell does two
things simultaneously: it causes the target to lose some of their life
force (constitution) as well as immediate damage due to the magical
strength of the spell.~

.~

0 0 1 Withering Flesh~
.This evocation burns a foe with unholy fire, blistering their skin and
burning bone.  The black flames are called from the dark demonic planes
and are powerful enough to destroy stone with their corruptive touch. 
Victims of the black fire find their bodies poisoned as well as badly
burnt.  Despite its slowness to summon, the demonic flames are a great
way for a sorcerer to announce their presence to a lesser creature.
~

.Effect -- Fireball like damage + poisons
Reagent -- of Lies, Demon gall stone (shop bought consumed)
Resist -- Fire
cast_mess A pillar of infernal flames
~

0 0 19 Wood Imps~
.Travelers between Chiiron and Medienne have been reporting odd occurrences
on their journeys between the two towns.  Some of these reports cite
incidences of lost pets, horses disappearing, and one case of a vanishing
party member.  Accounts vary as to the exact location of these events, but
all agree that the events happened nearer to Chiiron and the ancient forest
rising along the mountains that drop down to the Sea of Stars, than to the
more populated areas around Medienne.

Because they live in close proximity to a large colony of wood spiders, but
primarily for lack of a better name, the creatures residing within the dark
woods to the north of the Northern Sea Trail have been dubbed wood imps.
Although not imps in the strictest sense, in appearance they most certainly
resemble the lesser forms of these demonic creatures.

Wood imps have a budding, primitive community just emerging from the lowest
forms of barbarism.  They are a loosely formed group of hunter/gatherers
turned scavengers and predators upon the weak and undefended.  They have no
leader as such, but their shaman uses a feral wit and cunning to manipulate
them.  Although at this time they are no threat to the well-armed and
skilled adventurers, the lone traveler and those less experienced in the
art of battle would be hard pressed to ward off an organized attack from
these savage creatures.~

.This is by no means an accurate or to scale representation of this world.
This map is merely provided as a tool to aid you in your conceptualization
of the geopolitical layout of this world.  The biggest misrepresentation
this map gives is the illusion that the human region (Chiiron and Medienne)
is both central and considerably larger than the other regions.  This is
simply not the case - we simply have not completed the other regions and
cannot provide a similar level of detail.

0 0 1 Wraith Form~
.First, the sorcerer wraps him/her self in the flesh of the dead.  Second,
they transform their flesh into that of the dead.  The last step before
becoming a memeber of the undead is to imitate the spirits.  Sorcerers
are now capable of transforming theirself into that of a wraith.  They
are not true undead yet, but they are now another step closer.

write <field> : writes the file specified by field

Allowed Fields = { areas, mobs, objects, help, trainers, shops, tables,
all, notes, quest, rtable, exp, clans, lists, players }

@cDESCRIPTION@n

This command saves the various files to disk.  Be careful with @Cwrite all@n as
it produces a decent amount of lag.

@CWrite@n without an argument is used to save only the changes to the area you
are currently working in. Use this to lessen lag when possible.

@Cwrite -f all@n is the laggiest of all as it forces saving of everything
(even things that haven't been flagged as modified / unsaved) and
therefore should be used very sparingly

0 0 19 Wyrm Lair~
.There have been reports of odd tremors in the earth's surface, deep
within the Cairn Mountains, not far from Kha-da.  A dwarven corpse was
found lying in the snow to the north and west of the city, half its body
eaten away and covered in a thick layer of green slime.  Those sent to
investigate the strange occurrences report immense snake-like creatures
burrowing into the snow near the site of the unfortunate dwarf. 
Strange-looking holes have been tunneled through the snow and deep into
the stone of the old mountain.

0 0 7 Xharax~
.@CXharax@n - God of the Undead and Demons.

Xharax, called the accursed, has very few mortal followers, as he tends to
rarely listen to any prayers of assistance from the mortal realms.  His
attention appears to be placed on other more vile regions where his minions
reign supreme.  He has however, realized the knowledge and strength that
such followers provide, and has begun teaching them the black arts.  Most
of his worshippers are necromancers, who seek to use dark magics to raise
the dead and summon demons, for their own personal power, and that of
Xharax himself.

His temples are well hidden, and most people will live their entire lives
never hearing of, let alone seeing one.  Rumour has it that one must abound
on a deadly quest, from which many never return.  His brothers, Taraskatt
and Khalmor, make up the threesome that is the Ebon Triumvirate, though
only their followers know how loyal each is to the rest of the trio at any
point in time.  His greatest enemies are the gods of justice, life, and
white magic, Chandros, Halina, and Tairae, but he has a special hatred in
his black heart for Tairae, the opposite in his spell casting viewpoints.

When he comes before those chosen few who are in his service, Xharax is
known only to appear as a shadowed man with eyes of molten lava, bearing a
huge pair of demonic wings on his back.  His insignia to all who know him
is a burning skull on a field of midnight black, depicting the pain and
desolation that his undead and demonic creatures are capable of inflicting.~

yell <string> : sends a string to all rooms in your area

@cDESCRIPTION@n

Use @Cyell@n to send a message to everyone in your present area.  It costs no
gossip points, and can be useful if, for instance, you become separated
from your group in a perilous place (and you like to roleplay).  It is also
of use when communicating with others not in your group, but still nearby.
If you wish to send a string to the entire mud, see the @CShout@n command.

Note that like @CChat@n, @CGossip@n, @CAuction@n, and even @CShout@n, this is a channel in
which profanity is @Cnot@n acceptable.~

You use the @Czap@n command to use one of your wands upon a target.  Wands
generally have charges and the use of @Czap@n will expend a charge.  When
depleted of all of their charges, wands make excellent kindling.  You must
be holding a wand in order to be able to @Czap@n with it.

0 0 19 Zarander's Tower~
.Far to the north and west of Kha-da, situated in the heart of a secluded
secluded valley, rises the tower of the Wizard Zarander.  Although renown
in his youth as a strong conjurer and an adventuring mage, of late no one
has seen him.  Some say he has simply become a hermit, while other rumors
would have you believe he was murdered by his assistant, whom people have
not seen for quite some time either.  The only possible clues, if any
remain, must lie within the Tower itself.~
