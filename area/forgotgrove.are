At the Edge of a Small Forest Grove~
It is as though there were an invisible, one directional barrier between
the desert to the north and the small grove here which spreads out before
you.  The barrier, though, is nothing that you can see or even feel. 
Rather, it remains as a nebulous 'sensation' that crawls through your
mind like a boring beetle.  Two stone columns, twins in every respect,
stand at the edge of the perceived barrier, just to the north.  Through
the columns, you can feel the hot and blazing winds of the desert
sweeping through into the cool and moist climate here.  A border of tall,
tightly-spaced cedar trees grow to the east while a cornucopia of other
trees and colorful forest plants lie to east, west and south.  An
intangible feeling, that this forest has somehow remained untouched by
man, hangs heavily in the air.

E
barrier~
Examining the barrier, you notice that it is quite invisible.  The only
perceivable way across it lies through the threshold of the twin columns
which stand to either side.  Through them, you can see the desert beyond.
~
E
twin stone columns~
Identical in every respect, the columns of stone which stand amidst the
barrier are carved from pale white marble.  A variety of things have been
inset and inscribed into the columns, including a series of valuable gems
and hieroglyphics.
~
E
gems~
The gems set into the twin columns are cut into tear-drop shapes and have
gleaming facets which reflect the light.  In all cases, the gems are
securely set into the marble of the columns.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
~
E
border cedar trees~
Most of the secluded, forest grove is ringed by either tightly-spaced oak
or cedar trees.  Here, mighty cedars grow together in a tight band to the
east.
~
E
cornucopia plants other colorful~
A variety of different trees and plants thrive within the confines of
this ancient grove.  Among them you can see an ancient rowan tree, a
stand of ashwood trees, yet more oak and cedar trees, pine trees, and
even a weeping willow.  Clusters of wild flowers, thistle vines, orchids,
holly bushes, and other plants grow en masse throughout the rest of the
grove as well.

Northeast Corner of a Small Forest Grove~
A majestic grove of innumerable years stretches out before you in all its
splendor.  At one time, you can tell this grove was probably the pride of
the valley.  But now, there are relatively few trees and those which
remain huddle about one another almost protectively.  The climate here is
very much different from that of the desert to the north.  In all other
directions, the assortment of trees and plant varieties are simply
astounding.

trees~
If there were more hours in the day, you still could not attach a name to
every tree found in this small yet vibrant grove.  For the most part, the
grove is ringed by oak or cedar trees.  Somewhere to the south you can
see the tell-tale peaks of pine trees.  You can also see a stand of
ashwood trees, a rowan tree, and a weeping willow, all near each other.
~
E
plants~
A wide array of plants have taken root in this small, sheltered grove. 
There are a lot of thistle vines growing up and along a lot of the trees. 
A few holly bushes grow to the far west.  There are even a few patches of
beautiful flowers like orchids and angel's feather strewn throughout the
grove.  You have but to look around you to discover the lush plants which
abound.

Near the Heart of the Forest Grove~
The trees in this part of the ancient valley grove grow tall and
straight, with few branches sprouting off their trunks for at least the
first twenty feet.  Pieces of stone, shiny from a slick, wet moss
covering their surfaces, lie here and there at the base of a few of the
trees.  As light shines down through the leafy canopy, shadows play
across the wrinkled bark of the trees, giving you the impression of faces.

E
trees~
In this part of the grove, there is something quite unusual about the
trees.  For one thing, they are all of the same variety, though exactly
what you have no idea.  Secondly, every single tree looks to be of the
same height.  Last but not least, the trees appear to have only two
thick, massive branches supporting a host of green leaves.
~
E
slick wet moss~
So green it is almost black, thick moss covers almost every inch of the
rocks and stones lying amidst the leaves on the forest floor.  Strangely,
the moss cannot be found anywhere on the trees here, as though it dare
not touch them.
~
E
pieces stone~
A few slabs of stone lie on the ground and look like perfect places to
sit.  Mostly, the slabs are made of granite, but one or two of them have
been cut from orange quarry stone and appear to have been dragged here.
~
E
4 bases~
At the base of each tree, two huge roots can be seen plunging down into
the earth, undoubtedly in search of nutrients.  Usually, trees have more
than just two roots holding them in place but these mighty trees
apparently need only two.
~
E
wrinkled bark faces~
As you examine the tree trunks more carefully, you are amazed at how
close some of them resemble faces.

At the Heart of the Small Forest Grove~
This may not be the geographic center of the small grove, but something
whispers into your mind that this its true heart.  There is a feeling of
peace and serenity higher than anything else you have felt here.  Much of
the forest floor is covered with dry and dead leaves and broken branches. 
The parts of the forest floor which are not have been overrun by dark
green wildgrass.  Tall, sheltering trees of every type stand like natural
sentinels in every direction.  Unlike most of the trees, though, the ones
to the west appear strangely different and perhaps a bit...nervous.

Between the smaller gaps in between the encircling trees, masses of wiry
green vines grow in abundance, clogging up the gaps.
~
E
leaves~
Heaps of dead and dried leaves already on their way to being reclaimed by
nature lie strewn about the forest floor.  The only thing these leaves
are good for are playing and jumping in.
~
E
grass~
In most places, the canopy of leaves formed by the surrounding trees make
it impossible for ordinary grass, a plant that loves sunlight, to grow. 
The grass here is no exception.  The only grass which grows along the
dark forest floor is a strange, pallid yellow grass with forked blades. 
Tiny mounds of purple and yellow stick up out of the grass in a few
places.
~
E
purple yellow mounds~
On closer examination, the tiny 'mounds' turn out to be mushrooms. 
Minuscule purple mushrooms with yellow dots along their caps protrude out
of the wild grass no more than a couple of inches.  The mushrooms smell
delectable.

Near the Heart of the Forest Grove~
Though the lush and green grove is calm and serene, the clearing to the
west seems even more so.  Here, the trees grow at a slight angle in an
effort from their branches to break through the existing canopy formed
from the larger and taller trees around them.  Tiny saplings and sprigs
of grass grow along the forest floor in the spots where sunlight is able
to cascade down through the woven blanket of greenery.  To the east looms
a tall but strange-looking tree and to the south, at the edge of the
grove, stands a massive but ancient rowan tree.

Before an Incredibly Strange Tree~
You have seen a lot of unusual and odd trees in your lifetime, but this
one has to be the strangest.  While it has branches, leaves, and a trunk,
that is where the similarities between it and a normal tree end.  This
particular tree has bright orange bark, blue leaves shaped like
five-pointed stars and branches which end in human-like hands.  Several
pieces of cone-shaped fruit also hang from the tree, suspended from a few
of the fingered hands.  At the southeast corner of the grove rises a
small stand of ashwood trees and to the west the old but peaceful grove
continues.  The top of a massive rowan tree can barely be seen through
the canopy, to the southwest.

The trunk and branches of the tree are covered with a brilliant orange
bark.  The bark itself, rather than being an outer layer of dead plant
material, is composed of tiny, interlocking, triangular scales.
~
E
leaves star five-pointed blue~
About as big around as your palm, star-shaped leaves cling to the orange
tree branches.  Each leaf has five points, like a pentagram.  Wide veins
of red run from each tip of the leaf to converge at the stem, which folds
under some of the triangular orange bark scales.  The leaves cover nearly
every each of the strange tree's branches, except their ends, which end
in human-like fingers.
~
E
branches human-like hands~
As the trunk of the strange tree diverges into branches, the branches
rise upwards.  At the end of each branch are finger-like twigs, which are
black and not orange in color.  In the "grasp" of some of these "hands,"
there are unusual, cone-shaped fruits.
~
E
cone-shaped fruit~
Pieces of cone-shaped fruit hang from the hand-like ends of some of the
tree's branches.  Never before have you seen such fruit!  Each has a
circular base which is deep red in color but as the fruit tapers and
extends upwards, the color fades, until it is a creamy white color.  A
faint, minty odor hands around the fruit.

Southeast Corner - A Stand of Ashwood Trees~
At the southeastern fringe of the secluded grove, just inside the stout
ring of encircling oak trees, stands a small copse of ashwood trees.  The
trees vary in height, from a sapling which barely reaches up to your
knees to a gigantic brute of an ashwood who stands a good forty feet tall. 
At the foot of one of the ashwood trees, there are fresh scratches in the
dirt.  To the north rise the branches of a strange and gnarled tree while
to the west the golden yellow leaves of an ancient rowan tree weave in a
near-hypnotic pattern.

An Ancient Rowan Tree~
While there are oak trees to the south and lush greenery all around,
there is only one tree here in the immediate vicinity.  But, oh, what a
tree it is.  The tree has near-ebony roots which are partly exposed, a
trunk thicker than a pachyderm covered with dark brown bark, and immense
branches that look like they could buckle under their own weight at any
moment.  Juxtaposed against the burly and massive features of the tree, a
spray of delicate golden yellow leaves cover nearly every inch of its
branches.  If this tree is not the oldest in the grove, it is very close
to being so.

E
rowan tree~
Unlike most rowan trees who have clusters of orange-red berries and
sprays of gentle white flowers up and down their branches, this deciduous
tree is devoid of both.  Instead, the ancient tree has leaves of a golden
yellow color that even a blind man would find beautiful.
~
E
branches~
With a tree as ancient as this one must be, it suffers from an affliction
that it cannot get away from: weight death.  Judging from the looks of
the sagging branches, it is only a short amount of time before the tree
folds under its own weight.  One well placed kick or shake would probably
send the poor tree crashing to its grave.
~
E
thick trunk~
The bark of this deciduous tree is of a dark brown color and has several
places where branches were removed from its lower trunk in the distant
past.  Large knot holes are evidence of this.  Around a couple of the
knot holes, a wispy moss clings to the bark of the tree.
~
E
wispy moss~
In a couple of places, the wispy golden moss covers the trunk of the
tree, resembling facial hair and eye brows.
~
E
knot holes~
Though several knot holes mar the smooth, dark brown deciduous trees
bark, the two which look the most interesting stand side by side, almost
like eyes.  And as you look closer, a trail of golden moss runs down the
front of the tree as if to form a beard and eyebrows.  In fact, the trunk
of the tree looks so much like a face that you are tempted to talk to it.
~
E
near-ebony roots~
In several places, the near ebony roots of the grand rowan tree have been
almost gnawed in to.  Where this has occurred, a thick, viscous sap as
red as blood collects in small pools beneath the roots.

Forest Grove - Near a Rowan Tree~
Massive and tall oak trees surround this small grove, providing a natural
fence for the vibrant forest.  Flowering bushes and plants grow around
and near most of the fruit trees here, adding their own little splashes
of color to an already colorful and tranquil scene.  Situated as far away
from the trees as possible, there is a circle of stones set deep into the
ground.  Most of the stones are rough pieces of granite, but a couple
appear to be of pale green limestone.  Rustling in the breeze, the golden
yellow leaves of an ancient rowan tree, whose branches are thicker than
your waist, beckon to you.

circle stones~
Situated a safe distance from anything flammable, someone has built a
modest fire pit.  The pit is built deep and has been encircled with small
chunks and wedges of stone.  Whoever built this fire pit respected the
forest a great deal to take so much time and caution in building it away
from the trees and foliage.
~
E
granite~
Most of the granite rocks in the circle of stones are grey granite, a
fairly common rock, especially in the canyon of the Southern Narak Desert. 
Since you have not seen any other sources of granite near here, you
presume that the pieces here came from the desert.
~
E
pale green limestone~
Mixed in with the wedges of grey granite, there are a few fragments of
limestone.  Each piece of the pale green stone is slightly blackened on
both sides and tiny, hairline fractures riddle through the pieces as
though some great force impacted them.
~
E
fruit trees~
While there is an abundance of edible things within the small grove, the
trees here are the only ones which bear fruit.  And in fact, there are
two types of fruit trees here.  The first set of fruit trees look to be
pear trees, for they have glossy green leaves, white flowers, and pieces
of fruit which are spherical at the bottom and taper at the end towards
the stem.  The other trees can be nothing else but orange trees, for
globes of yellowish-red fruit hang from their many branches.
~
E
bushes flowering plants~
Among all the growing bushes and flowers, there is a large patch of red
clover flourishing beneath the fruit trees.  The clover covers much of
the ground where little grass will grow and it has leaflets in bunches of
three.  Globular heads of fragrant, rose-purple flowers peek up out of
the clover beds.

Forest Grove - Near a Weeping Willow~
All around you, there are trees of every shape and size imaginable.  From
apple trees to zrelbark trees, this small, secluded grove plays host to a
chorus of life.  Dark green vines hang from the boughs of a giant weeping
willow which lies to the west and to the northwest stands a circle of
trees more ancient than any in this forest if their size is any clue. 
Though the ground is covered with dead, fallen leaves and the occasional
broken branch, a carpet of lush vegetation rolls out through the grove. 
In the shadow of one of the larger trees, a single orchid plant pokes
through the vegetation.  In the distance to the far east, you can barely
see the golden-yellow leaves of a magnificently large rowan tree.

Before a Grand Weeping Willow~
Massive oak trees rise up to the south, providing a natural border for
the ancient forest grove.  While there are pine tress to the west, and a
lot of exotic vegetation growing en masse to the east, only a single tree
inhabits the clearing here.  And yet, the tree, a colossal weeping willow
whose height rivals any tree you have seen before, seems to be both a
tree and not a tree at the same time.  Its branches droop in graceful
arcs and its deep brown bark looks smooth and soft.  Besides its enormous
size, the only unusual feature about the ancient weeping willow are two
dark, pitted holes in its trunk.

For a moment, as the limbs of the ancient willow shake to and fro, an

Southwest Corner - A Stand of Pine Trees~
Broad, massive oak trees rise up along the edges of the grove, their
trunks so close together that you can barely see between them.  Just
before the edge, though, stands a copse of pine trees, whose soft needles
whisper in the breeze.  A few of the larger, older trees show obvious
signs of lightning and storm damage.  A pair of pillow-like rocks lie at
the base of a couple of pine trees, their granite surfaces covered with
soft and inviting moss.  The branches of an incredibly grand willow tree
droop sorrowfully to the east.

Appropriately named 'carpet moss,' the mass of tiny, fibrous plants

At one time, severe lightning and heavy winds must have tore at this

the mighty pines.

Tall Trees Surounding Ruins~
Tall cedar and pecan trees rise high into the sky, where they splay their
leafy branches to create a canopy of greenery.  Neither the light of the
sun nor the moons can penetrate too deeply through the blanket of life
overhead.  Piles of dead leaves, rotten pecans, and discarded pecan
shells litter the forest floor.  In many places, the trees grow close
enough together that not enough a gnome or a sprite could hope to get
between or past them.  What catches your eye most about about the grove
here are the stone ruins which you can see resting in heaps to the
northeast.  From the way the forest has encroached upon the broken stone
formation, it appears they have been in such a state for a long time.

The ruins to the east look to be the remains of a monument which probably
stood about a fourth as tall as the great pyramid.  The blocks of quarry
stone from which the obelisk was constructed lie in fallen heaps, and are
riddled with cracks and fissures.  The pale green limestone which once
covered the surface of the obelisk seems to have fared no better for the
chunks of it you see are charred and fractured.

Forest Grove - At the Edge of a Fallen Monument~
Though chunks of limestone and pale orange quarry stone litter the forest
floor from the broken monument which lies to the east, the plants and
trees do not seem to mind.  In fact, in some places the roots of trees or
maturing saplings have grown at unusual angles around the pieces of stone. 
In other places, the stones have been sundered in half by growing
vegetation forcing cracks in the stone wider.  Whatever the case, it
appears that the forest has undertaken the task of reclaiming the remains
of the fallen pillar of stone.  Patches of red and yellow lichen cover a
majority of the broken stone shards.

Much of the limestone is riddled with minute cracks and fractures, as
though some great force struck the once great obelisk.  And as for the
pieces of limestone which surround the broken chunks of quarry stone,
most possess blackened surfaces and char marks.  Markings or
hieroglyphics of some kind at one time had been etched over the surface
of the limestone, but time has worn the ancient writings smooth off.

broken monument 1 east~
To the east lies the broken remains of an obelisk which, at one time,
must have rose a couple of feet into the air.  Some of the quarry stone
blocks which lie about in cluttered heaps are ten to fifteen feet in
diameter.  The only part of the obelisk seemingly intact is its tip,
which must have fallen straight off when the monument collapsed.
~

While some of the roots have plunged willy-nilly down through the very

Northwest Corner - Amidst Tall Oak Trees~
Unlike the desert which lies just a few hundred yards to the north, the
climate here is cool and welcoming.  All around you, trees and plants of
both ordinary and exotic varieties thrive in a celebration of life.  Most
of the trees in this part of the grow are tall, sturdy oaks, whose
sheltering branches creates a canopy which is almost impervious to
sunlight.  To the east, past a large stump there is clear evidence of an
ancient stone structure while to the south, the forest flora is in full
bloom.  The trees and vegetation along the north and west grow in a
tangled mass, forming a natural barrier against trespassing.

All around you loom mighty oak trees of every size and shape.  Some have
many branches while others have but a few.  The most remarkable thing
about the tall oak trees, aside from their bright green leaves, is that,
without fail, the tallest of the oaks lie at the edge of the grove.  Many
of the oaks' branches arc gracefully overhead forming part of the canopy
above.
~
E
canopy~
The canopy of leaves and branches up overhead allows but little light, be
it moon or sun, to pass down through to the ground.  Much of the canopy
consists of the upper branches of the mighty oak trees which surround the
outside of the grove in a protective circle.
~
E
plants~
All sorts of green and unusual plants can be found growing along around
the base of some of the trees and along the forest floor.  Several rubber
plants, a couple of holly berry bushes, and a host of thistle vines are
just a few of the many species of plants growing in the forest.
~
E
flowers~
Clusters of red and yellow wild flowers grow at the base of each oak
tree, adding a splash of color to their dark brown and grey bark-covered
trunks.  Also, in scattered patches along the forest floor, purple sage
bushes and white orchids flourish.
~
E
vegetation~
In terms of grass and other lower forms of vegetation, there is not much
for there is not enough sunlight for much to prosper in the ancient
forest.  Out of what little grass and vegetation that can grow, there are
three varieties.  The first two look to be of ordinary vines, but the
third appears to be of a hybrid grass which is dark green on the upside
and a velvet blue on the underside.
~
E
holly bushes~
The holly bushes clustered around a couple of the trees are just now in
full bloom.  With their smooth but jagged leaves protecting its crop of
fresh, new berries, most predators would probably think twice about being
lured in by the attractive berry.

A Forest Grove Surrounding Ruins~
Leaving little room from movement in between, a series of tall cedar
trees rise up with their branches reaching up into the sky as if in
supplication.  Their leaves are of the deepest green and their bark shows
no signs of either animal or insect bites.  In a couple of places,
though, the roots of the trees are exposed.  While the edge of the forest
grove appears to be to the east, the grove continues onward to the west,
where there are oak trees of amazing size and proportions.  There is
enough of a clearing through the trees to the south for you to
distinguish the ruins of a once-great pillar of stone.

E
pillar stone ruins~
To the south, it is apparent that at one time, a massive pillar of stone
once reached up into the sky like a cleric begging mercy from the gods. 
But now, as is often the fate of such grand structures, its time has
passed, and it lies in crumbled ruins.  Not much remains of the obelisk
save its giant, pyramidal tip, which is still sheathed in pale green
limestone.
~
E
roots~
In a few places, the roots of the grand cedar trees are exposed.  The
reason for this has nothing to do with infestation or animal inhabitation
but rather age.  As old as they are, the cedar trees do not look capable
of withstanding the weight of their own limbs for many more centuries.  A
couple of chunks of rock lie wedged beneath some of the exposed roots.
~
E
chunks rock~
These chunks of rock are fractured pieces of quarry stone and look to
belong to the broken monument to the south.  The fragments of stone are
more than just wedged in between the roots of the cedars; they are a part
of them.  The roots have plunged directly through the stones in an effort
to reach the ground.
~
E
cedar trees~
Taller than stone giants and as straight as an arrow, you have seen few
trees as mighty as these cedar trees.  Only those of Medienne forest or
perhaps some of the greater Shuvana trees can rival these green giants. 
The leaves, which cover the cedar trees' branches, are of a rich verdant
and nearly twice the size of your hand and their bark is smooth and thick.
~
E
stump~
Obscured by shadow and the mighty presence of all the living cedar trees,
this large tree stump looks freshly cut.  You can still see the sap
oozing down its sides.  At the foot of one of the stump's roots, there is
a leafy green shoot branching outward off of the stump.  Perhaps the tree
might one day regain its place among its kin.

Tip of an Obelisk~
Shattered sections of pale orange quarry stone and green limestone lie
all around in a debris field.  Amidst the ruins stands but a single piece
of stone in the shape of a pyramid which has survived destruction.  The
pyramid stands about ten feet tall and rests at the base of the broken
obelisk.  Indeed, the pyramid is actually what remains of the obelisk's
tip and remains fairly intact, save for a bit of charring around the
edges. Wiry, leaf-covered vines grow all over the stone remains.  To
the south a group of trees circle together, their trunks so close
together that not an inch of space stands between them.

E
1 south trees ~
The trees to the south seem to be encircling an area of the grove,
towards its center.  Though you cannot see in between the trees, because
they are so close together, you can heard the faint, musical trickle of
cascading water.
~
E
tip~
Amazingly, the very tip of the once mighty obelisk which once stood very
near hear, stands almost completely intact.  Small cracks and fractures
occur along the base of the pyramidal structure and the edges and very
tip of the stone construction are blackened as though from fire or
lightning.  Engraved in the pale-green limestone, hieroglyphics adorn
each of the four sides of the obelisk, starting with the northside.
~
E
northside crook~
A panel of hieroglyphics has been etched into the northside of the
obelisk's tip and you can barely make out the remains of a blue pigment
which once filled in the engravings.  Carved into the panel are images of
an owl, a twisted crook, a jackal-like creature, and several geometric
shapes.
~
E
westside feather~
The western side of the tip of the obelisk contains an intricately
bordered hieroglyphics panel.  Yet, inside the panel there is but one
symbol: a feather.
~
E
eastside arm~
Engraved into the limestone sheeting of the obelisk's tip, there is a
hieroglyphics panel which sports a series of interesting yet cryptic
symbols.  Among them, there are scarabs, crescent moons, a feather, and
an arm reaching across the feather from east to west.
~
E
shattered sections stone~
The shattered sections of stone strewn all about the clearing consists of
sheets of pale green limestone and precision-cut, square blocks of orange
quarry stone.  At one time, it is apparent that the sections of stone
rested atop one another with the pyramidal structure on top, but some
force has brought the ancient monument down into ruins.  Judging from all
the vegetation grown up around the sections of stone, from bushes to
trees, the monument has lain like this for quite some time.  Perhaps
decades or even centuries.
~
E
obelisk~
Judging from what remains of the monument, this was once a great obelisk
which towered over most everything except for the colossal pyramid which
lies somewhere to the north, in the Naraki Desert.  Its widest point was
at its base, and as it rose upwards the structure gently tapered, until
capped by the tip of stone which lies here.
~
E
southside wings~
Once the vines have been cleared from the southside of the obelisk's tip,
you can make out a panel of hieroglyphics.  This panel consists of a bird
in flight, several saucer or cup-shaped images, an open eye, and an urn.

Inside a Broken Monument~
At one time, this chamber must have served as some grandiose ritual
center.  The walls are constructed of pale orange quarry stone which has
been cut and fitted together with greater skill than even the best
dwarven craftsman could muster.  While the quarry stone walls are covered
with panel after panel of hieroglyphics, it is the floor and ceiling of
the chamber which lends to the unusual.  Along the floor there is an
inlaid, silver etching of a square design.  The ceiling bears a similar
etching, but of gold and a circle.  To the east, framed by vertical
strips of hieroglyphics, there is a passage into another part of what
remains of the obelisk.  A single ray of light streams down from the top
of the chamber, to land just outside the inlaid square.

E
gold circle ceiling~
A perfect circle has been etched into the ceiling and filled with gold. 
You are not certain as to what purpose the circle serves or once served,
but it clearly seems to be ceremonial or part of some ritual.  Directly
below the golden circle, etched in a similar manner on the floor of the
chamber, is a silver square.
~
E
silver square floor~
Directly below a circle of gold etched into the ceiling rests a similar
etching.  But this one is square in shape and is filled with silver, not
gold.  The square and circle look like they once served a ceremonial
purpose, but as to what, you have no idea.  There is evidence that
something large, a block of stone or an altar, perhaps, at one time
rested at the center of the square.
~
E
passage~
The passage east, which leads into another chamber, appears to have been
hastily and newly crafted.  Or at least the construction is new in
comparison with the rest of the structure.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
Out of all the hieroglyphics, only the second, fifth, and ninth panels of
them have remained intact through the ages.  The rest have either been
torn apart by deep, rending cracks in the quarry stone or have faded away
into illegibility.
~
E
vertical strips~
Unlike the majority of the hieroglyphics adorning the walls, the two
vertical strips standing to either side of the eastern passage remain
completely intact.
~
E
walls~
At one time, panels of hieroglyphics decorated the walls of this chamber,
three panels each.  But deep cracks have destroyed many of them, scoring
their surfaces completely with small fissures.  Also, along the walls are
various hieroglyphic symbols standing alone by themselves.  They include
a skull, a coin, an eye, and a holy symbol of sorts and a mask.
~
E
eye open oval~
Engraved into one of the walls is a hieroglyphic of an eye.  The eye is
wide open and blue and brimming with wisdom.
~
E
skull~
On the lower right hand corner of the southmost wall there is a
hieroglyphic of a skull.  Though just a drawing, it conveys a deep sense
of death.
~
E
gold coin~
Depicted with a yellowish-gold paint, a drawing of a golden coin adorns
one of the walls.  On its obverse side, the only one visible, there is a
picture of a roaring dragon curled about a tremendous hoard of treasure.
~
E
holy symbol~
One of the hieroglyphics on the wall is that of a lone symbol.  Shaped
like a cross with a looped top, the symbol is rendered in a silvery paint.
~
E
mask beautiful~
One of the lone hieroglyphics remaining intact on the cracked walls is
that of a mask.  The features on the mask are quite beautiful by any
standard.  So beautiful are they that it seems almost like an expression
of vanity.

Inside a Monument~
The walls of this rectangular chamber are framed by gigantic blocks of
orange quarry stone.  Down and through many of the stones, though, run
deep cracks, as though great stress has been placed upon the cool, stone
walls.  Hieroglyphics adorn nearly every square inch of the walls and
ceiling, painted in neat rows using a variety of pigments.  Two passages
lead out of the chamber, one to the west and one to the south.  Both
thresholds appear to be hastily crafted and lack the same precision and
attention to exactness that is shared throughout the construction of the
rest of the chamber.

Deep cracks run diagonally across the surface of the quarry stone walls,

legible.

Lopsided Chamber~
It appears as if some great earthquake has assaulted this rectangular
chamber, whose height decreases slightly from west to east.  The room is
drastically slanted, with its southwest corner dipping down.  Thus, it is
also very difficult to maintain your balance in here.  Although the pale,
orange quarry stone walls are covered with rows of hieroglyphics, many of
the enigmatic depictions have been rendered unreadable by wide cracks
that run down and over them like a series rampaging river tributaries. 
The floor and ceiling are made of hard-packed sand, which shows no signs
of giving way.  Rough and seemingly makeshift passages branch off from
the room, to other oddly-constructed chambers to the north, west, and
east.

walls quarry stone~
The interior walls of this chamber are build from chiseled blocks of
pale, orange quarry stone.  The sides have been hand smoothed and set
into place with an eye to precision rivaled by none.  Each block of stone
is about five feet long and three feet high and must weigh in excess of
five thousand pounds.
~
E
ceiling floor hard-pack sand ~
The ceiling and floor of this chamber are made of hard-packed tan sand,
and not quarry stone.  Judging from the cracks running along the
stonework of them both, it seems apparent that at one time, this chamber
had a stone ceiling and floor in place of the sand.  Someone has gone to
a lot of trouble to reconstruct this chamber after whatever natural
disaster is suffered.
~
E
corner~
A lot of sand and flecks of stone have collected in a pile in the corner,
where it dips downward sharply.  Most of the pieces of stone lodged in
the corner appear to be from the walls, where fissures have destroyed the
wall surfaces.
~
E
hieroglyphics enigmatic depictions~
From birds, to lizards, serpents to scarabs, all manner of creatures and
designs decorate the remaining two hieroglyphic panels which adorn the
walls of the chamber.  All the other stone chiseled panels have been
destroyed as cracks and fissures have descended down through their
surfaces.  This leaves only the fourth and seventh panel of hieroglyphics
at all legible.

Broken Chamber~
It looks as though this rectangular chamber, which narrows slightly from
west to east, at one time was part of the obelisk's mid-section.  The
west wall is nothing but a sheer barrier of broken orange quarry stone
while the edges of the east wall are jagged and sharp, as though it has
been snapped apart from another part of the obelisk.  The ceiling, walls,
and floor give credence to this notion for they are covered with neat
little rows of carefully penned hieroglyphics.  This in itself is not
unusual.  But the fact that the rows run horizontal and not vertical
indicates that they, and the entire chamber, are lying on their side.

Judging from the amount of debris clogging the west passage, a
significant portion of the broken obelisk must lie in that direction. 
There are no gaps in the debris and no hope of getting past it.
~
E
1 east~
The edges of the eastern passageway are rough and jagged.  It seems as
though a section of the obelisk which once connected to this chamber was
suddenly and brutally ripped away, leaving but sections of quarry stone
intact.  Hastily done patchwork has been utilized to patch the stone into
a new chamber.

ceiling floor panels hieroglyphics ~
The ceiling, floor, and the north and south walls of this chamber are
covered with horizontal panels of hieroglyphs.  For the most part, the
hieroglyphics are a crumbled mess, with cracks running down the middle of
most of them.  However, a few hieroglyphic panels, the first and sixth
one, are entirely whole.

Lopsided Chamber~
Like the chamber to the west, this one has a ceiling and floor formed
from hard-packed sand. It also looks like part of the chamber, the northwest part, is
sinking like a rock cast into quicksand.  The rectangular chamber tapers
slightly from west to east, being the narrowest down towards the east
side.  Though hieroglyphics grace most of the surface walls, the ones
along the east, are special.  Rather than being applied to the pale,
orange quarry stone walls with pigments, these have been sculpted into
the walls.  And unlike any other wall in this chamber, it is hewn, not
from coarse quarry rock, but from a single piece of rose quartz, which
has been polished until it gleams.

1 east rose quartz~
To the east stands a wall made of pure rose quartz, a very rare shade of
mineral.  Etched into the surface of the mineral are panels of
hieroglyphics which have remained completely intact through the ages and
through an apparent earthquake, if the cracks and fissures riddling the
walls are any indication.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
Twelve panels of hieroglyphics adorn the walls of this chamber.  For the
most part, deep fissures and stone fractures have streamed down through
the quarry stone, ripping the hieroglyphics away from the walls, along
with the stone.  Only two panels of hieroglyphics remain even partly
intact: the eleventh and eighth ones.  Both are etched into a wall of
pure rose quartz.
~

ceiling floor~
The ceiling and floor of this chamber are constructed from hard-packed
sand.  Incidentally, it is obvious that this was not the original layout

Clearing in the Forest - Near a Fallen Obelisk~
While trees and plants lie in every direction elsewhere, here they
recede, leaving a quaint little clearing, perfect for picnics or just
lounging around and taking in the wondrous view of exotic flora.  Several
slabs of pale orange quarry stone and limestone lie about the clearing,
covered with moss and colorful patches of lichen.  The chunks of stone
appear to be fragments of debris which have broken off of a much larger
stone formation, which rests on its side, in ruins, to the west.  Judging
from the vegetation growing on and over the stones, it has rested thus
for quite some time.

flora~
The most exotic pieces of flora in this part of the wood have to be a
series of snapdragon flowers who grow in a protective semi-circle around
half the clearing.
~
E
snapdragon flowers~
The snapdragon flowers growing along the edges of half the clearing stand
about a foot and a half tall and have petals either of a solid red,
yellow, or orange color with shades of the other two along the fringes.
~
E
clearing~
The ground, at last, is covered with a thin carpet of deep green grass,
for there are enough gaps in the canopy to allow ground cover to grow
here.  There are several rocks on which to sit on and a particularly flat
rock that would serve as a nice picnic table.
~
E
slabs orange quarry stone limestone chunks  fragments~
The pieces of stone scattered about come in two varieties: limestone and
quarry stone.  The quarry stone is of a faint orange color and composes a
bulk of the debris.  The limestone on the other hand is of a pale shade
of green and is far less abundant.  Both types of stone have suffered
severely, for cracks and charring score their surfaces deeply.
~
E
moss~
On the surface of both the rocks and trees grow a blood-red moss.  Unlike
most mosses which are soft and wet to the touch when in their prime, this
moss is coarse and dry.
~
E
lichen~
A foul-smelling lichen covers a fair amount of the rocks and trees in
this section of the grove.  While the lichen does not look to be of a
poisonous nature, you can never tell for sure.
~
E
ruins 1 west~
To the west lie the toppled ruins of a once tall and tapering monument. 
Blocks of quarry stone and limestone sheets rest in tumbled messes all
over.  At the center of the mess if a pyramidal structure, which at one
time probably was the tip of the monument.
~
E
vegetation~
Thick, sturdy vines creep and crawl over, under, around, and through all
the dark recess and over the stone ruins themselves.  For the most part,
the vines encompass most of the rocks, except in a few rare cases where a
sprig of some wild herb grows.

Near a Copse of Shifting Trees~
The trees in this part of the ancient grove are by far older than you
have seen almost anywhere.  Thick and sturdy trees rise powerfully to the
west in a complete circle, their trunks and branches so close together
and interwoven that it would be impossible for even a rabbit to wiggle
its way past.  In fact, it looks as though the only way through the
encircling grove to the west is to cut some of the trees down, which
would take more effort than its worth.  The encompassing trees act in a way
you have never seen before, swaying to and fro not with the cool and
gentle breeze, but against it.  It is as though the trees are wary of
your presence.  The forest looks much more peaceful and calm to the east,
and to the south, you can barely make out the drooping branches of an
enormous weeping willow.

A Golden Font Hidden Deep within the Grove~
Surrounded on all sides by trees and vines, this clearing lies virtually
hidden at the center of the grove.  A golden, three-tiered fountain
stands in the middle of the clearing, with water gurgling upwards out of
the fountain and falling musically from the topmost tier.  The font
appears to be made entire of gold, as do the statues which adorn it. 
Around the fountain, tiny honeysuckle bushes grow in abundance, filling
the tranquil clearing with a sweet-smelling fragrance.  All around you,
the trees shift and sway with the cool forest breeze.  Somehow, though,
while a sense of peace surrounds this place, the trees seem wary of your
presence all the same.

E
statues~
Each corner of the fountain is graced by a different statue.  The first
statue is that of a fairly attractive woman with six arms in a gossamer
dress.  Diagonal from her stands another female statue, but this one is
of a water nymph with serpentine hair.  Next to her is a statue of a
fabled wemic - the leonine equivalent of a centaur.  And across from him
is a handsome humanoid with feathery wings.  Each statue holds some type
of vessel from which a liquid pours down into the fountains basin.
~
E
wemic leonine~
Seemingly mixed together from both a lion and a man, the statue which
stands before you is like none you have ever seen before.  Like a
centaur, the upper portion of the wemic is that of a muscular man, with
bulging biceps and a mane of long, braided hair.  The man's face,
intelligent enough, resembles the ferocious features of a lion more than
anything.  Between the statues hands, he holds a wineskin, and from it a
pale red liquid flows into the fountain.  The lower portion of the statue
has the characteristics of a lion.  Its paws are quite large and tipped
with claws and it has powerful-looking legs.  A long, curving tail
protrudes from the hind end of the statue.  At the base of the statue is
a small, engraved placard.
~
E
handsome humanoid wings feathery~
In some ancient stories, there are tales of beautiful, winged beings who
serve the gods; they are called angels.  Gazing at the life- size statue
before you, you can understand why.  Clad only in a tight loincloth, the
statue has the form and features of a very handsome human male.  The
statue has both large and powerful arm and leg muscles.  Short crop hair
frames the statue's heavenly face and amazingly deep eyes.  At waist
level, the statue holds out a slender flask, from which pours a bright
blue liquid.  And as the liquid enters the fountain, some of it splashes
upwards, to drip down the statue's incredible pecs and abdominal muscles
and back into the fountain.  The only unusual thing about the statue,
aside from its incredible beauty, which even a troll might appreciate,
are the two massive, feathery wings sprouted from its back.  At the base
of the statue, there is an etching.
~
E
water nymph serpentine~
This golden statue is buxom and shapely beyond belief.  Wearing nothing
but a smile and her ankle-long hair, which, sadly, coils like a serpent
about her body strategically, the statue stands opposite another feminine
statue whose beauty can only pale in comparison.  The statue's face
resembles an elven maiden's; cool, serene, and beautiful.  In her hands,
the water nymph (for there is no mistaking her features for anything
less) holds an urn, from which a somber grey liquid pours into the
fountain.  Near the petite toes of the nymph, there is a small carving in
the gold.
~
E
woman six arms~
Neither attractive nor ugly, this statue is of an ordinary- looking woman. 
Her hair is of medium length and her garments those of a modest woman. 
About her head she wears a diadem of sorts, which encircles the crown of
her hair.  The only thing not ordinary about this female is that she has
six arms.  Count them, six.  Two of her hands she holds steepled, as
though praying.  Two more she holds out in supplication.  In her third
set of hands she holds a bowl, and pours from it a burgundy liquid which
falls into the fountain, to be mixed with its sparkling waters.  At the
statue's feet, there is an engraved plaque.

Until the water of the fountain mixes with the waters of the four
statues, it looks like an ordinary liquid.  But once it touches the floor
of the bottom basis and merges with the waters being poured out by the
four corner statues, it takes on a life of its own.

A host of vine-like bushes with tender green leaves and clusters of

With the aid of $p, you are finally able to fully 
understand the hieroglyphics here. They read: 

May this idol of the lesser deity Enserpina stand as a lasting tribute to
her once kind and thoughtful nature.  As a demigoddess to the People,
crafts and technology were her domain.  It is she who designed the Great
Pyramid, hoping to please her sister, the Goddess of the People.  A
fragment of her essence has been imbued into part of a stone circlet this
idol wears.  Only by gathering it and the essence of her siblings may the
Goddess of the People be restored to power.  Once this is done, She may
choose to restore unto Enserpina her once true and beautiful form.  Until
then, as payment for her betrayal, Enserpina, like all of the Goddess'
siblings, must endure whatever shattered bodies the Goddess thrust upon
them with the last vestiges of her fading will for their betrayal.

Until the Goddess is restored to power, this statue alone shall recall
and remind others of Lionemus' former strength and prowess.  It was
through his skills and brute strength that allowed the People to lay the
first stones of the Great Pyramid's foundation.  Were it not for his part
in the betrayal of the goddess, he would still walk the realms in his
true form.  But what was done is done and can only be undone by restoring
unto the Goddess her powers.  Though this idol be made of stone, a part
of it still retains Lionemus' former essence.  With it, in part, lies the
key to Her salvation.

understand the hieroglyphics here. They read: 

Never was there a more youthful, more handsome deity, as was the demigod
Ramuset.  And at times his want for merriment would fill the entire
valley, enlivening the spirits of the People, no matter what the occasion. 
And on his wings arrived many messages more swiftly than thought.  But
out of jealously, he joined his siblings in a fight against their sister,
the Goddess of the People.  And though they won the battle, banishing the
Goddess' powers and form from this plane, it was not without consequence
for it is said that now Ramuset must walk the land in the form of a
manbat, a creature as ugly as Ramuset was once beautiful.  Part of
Ramuset's essence has been imbued into part of this statue in hopes that
it might help right the grand betrayal of the heavens.

As daughter of the Keeper and bringer of light, Multiplina was once the
Goddess best friend and advisor.  When the Goddess of the valley was
betrayed by Multiplina and her other siblings, it startled Her most that
the daughter of the Balance would seek to overthrow Her.  As punishment,
the Goddess used her last influences upon this place to transform
Multiplina and her siblings into whatever their hearts most reflected at
the moment of their betrayal.  In hopes that one day the Goddess shall be
brought back among us, I, her last living vessel and priestess, have
imbued part of this idol with Multiplina's godly essence, for only
through it and the eccenses of the other demigods shall a way to bring
back the goddess be found.
