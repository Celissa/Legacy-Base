Deep Beech Forest~
The black soot like mold continues to thrive on the towering beech trees,
leaving them with a dark, sickly apperance.  Wasps and bees buzz around
tiny dew-drops that sprout from the mildew, the insects feeding on the
sweet droplets.  The broken remains of shells lie scattered about the
forest floor, their gleaming edges covered with a fresh layer of leaf
litter.

Deep Beech Forest~
Ferns and bracken grow under the shadows of the mountain beeches, their
high canopy only allowing a filtered light to reach the forest floor.  A
handful of broken shell fragments lie scattered upon the ground, most
buried under a thin layer of rotting leaves and old branches.  The smell
of sulfur and water drifts in from the northwest, the land sloping
downwards in that direction.

Deep Beech Forest~
A short drop to the west leads into a fern filled basin where tree ferns,
bracken and all manner of other fronded plant thrive.  Moss covered rocks
line the drop, their surface coated in damp dew.  The smell of rich loam
intermingles with a more chemical aroma of sulfur that appears to be
drifting in from the northwest.

on the air.

Sea of Ferns~
Fern plants spread before you.  Visibility has dropped, and is next to
none.  There is a slight slope up, and it rises into a beech tree forest. 
The larges ferns extent into the air much higher than your head can
reach, and block most of the view of the sky.  The leaves of the ferns
when viewed from above make it appear to be a sea of fern fronds.  A
steep cliff borders the fern gully to the east and the north.  Large
beech trees can be standing on top the steep enbankments.

Sea of Ferns~
A forest of ferns grows here, with each fern plant topping the height of
a full grown ogre.  Visibility is cut to near nothing as you wander about
this area.  Each of the large fern frond rises high into the air, and
spreads away from the base of the plant.  The fronds are large and fan
shapped, with many blades extending from a central point in the stem.

Sea of Ferns~
A valley of sorts has formed here, and ferns have taken over, as the only
form of vegetation Visibility past the fern is near impossible, as the
crowd in all around you.  There is a slight slope upwards, and it leads
into a beech tree forest.  The largest here ferns extent into the air
much higher than your head can reach, and block the view of most
everything.  The leaves of the ferns when viewed from above make it
appear to be a sea of fern fronds.

Deep Beech Forest~
Towering mountain beech trees grow in thick stands around this area. 
There is a shallow drop to the north of here, and the mountain beech
trees grow right up to the edge.  The forest continues to the west and
south, but the trees are too thick to get through from here.  The smell
of water and sulfur hang heavy on the air.

Deep Beech Forest~
Tall beech trees grow around the edge of a fern-filled gully, some of
their roots dangling through the sides of the bank.  Below the smell of
water, sulfur and decay drift up on a warm wind.  The forest spreads out
across slightly rolling country side that forms the western lands of
Talidar.

Deep Beech Forest~
A fallen tree lies split and torn, its death ripping out a large clearing
that could easily accommodate several wagons.  Grass, thorn bushes and
foxgloves grown amongst the new beech saplings; each of the plants racing
to grab the spot of the fallen giant Toadstools grow across the rotting
bark, their bright caps warning would-be eaters of their poisonous nature.

Deep Beech Forest~
A single oak tree grows amongst the black trunk beech trees its thick
roots forming a carpet that draws out the water and nutrients from the
soil.  Tiny oak saplings grow in a sprinkling around its base.  Beech
tree stumps surround the oak where it appears a space has been cleared in
the forest for the exotic to grow Nestled under its roots is a slab of
pale stone, a few words scrawled across it.

Deep Beech Forest~
Forest continues in earnest across the shadowed rolling hills of west
Talidar.  Towards the north and northwest the forest thickens greatly,
the mountain beech, red beech and black beech trees rising to great
heights, some near a hundred feet high.  Mightier than even the beech are
a scattering of kauri trees, each one over one hundred and fifty feet
high and at least thirty feet across at the base.

Deep Beech Forest~
Bottle brush and broom surround the edge of a small clearing, the yellow
flowers of the broom giving off a sweet almost buttery smell that
attracts droves of bees and wasps.  A cluster of sagebrush grows in the
clearing, the normally alpine plant struggling with the lowland
conditions.  A headstone lies beside the sagebrush, perhaps a grave stone
or way marker.

Deep Beech Forest~
A shallow, weed choked stream struggles between the roots of the beech
trees, flowing southwards down the gentle sloping ground.  Bulrushes grow
around the water course their dense foliage making it difficult to push
past the clumping plants.  Mounds of tiny leaves spread under the roots
of the trees where last winters fall has yet to rot away.

Deep Beech Forest~
Clusters of toadstools festoon the rotting beech leaves their dew-soaked
caps bent low under the enormous weight of a single water droplet. 
Towering beech trees rise up above the damp ground, their branches
bifurcating into a broad and dense canopy.  Scraggy manuka bushes grow
under the rough-barked trees, their black leaves hiding clusters of
bright pink and white flowers.

The beech forest seems to thin here in spots, and some of the sky is
visible between the boughs of the tall trees.  To the north you can see
some underbrush surrounding a small clearing, while in all other

Deep Beech Forest~
The rotting remains of fallen beech branches lie in a decaying mound
where they have obviously been dragged.  A squat slab of moss-covered
stone rises from a central clearing, around its base wild flowers
flourish.  Southwards the forest begins to thin slightly, the trees
younger than the deep woodlands about here.  Westwards a swirling mist
lurks between the trunks, the fog obscuring what lies in that direction.

Deep Beech Forest~
A massive beech tree grows in the middle of a swath of saplings, its
rough barked trunk over ten feet across.  Its branches reach skywards,
most of them draped in vines and sphagnum moss.  A scattering of metal
scraps and leather off casts decay at the base of the tree.  An opening
in the forest to the north leads into another clearing, this one
dominated by a squat slab of stone.

Deep Beech Forest~
A clearing has been cut from the beech forest, the stumps of the trees
slowly being buried under a sea of leaves and moss.  Stacks of chopped
branches and wood like to the south where someone has left the timber to
dry.  Unfortunately the forest appears to have other ideas, a lush layer
of toadstools spread across the tops of the wood, an indication that the
drying process is far from successful in the damp area.

Beech trees spread around you in a large forest.  The hills all around

into the forest red beech and black beech trees also.  A small mound of
moss covered dirt can be seen here in a small clearing.  Piles of leaves

The forest to the north and west of here is very dense.  The mountain
beech thin as more red beech and black beech trees take over.  The trees
in that section of the forest rising to great heights, some near a
hundred feet high.  Mightier than even the beech are a scattering of
kauri trees, each one over one hundred and fifty feet high and at least
thirty feet across at the base.  A slight acrid smell pervades the air
here.

deeply cut ribs.  The underside of the fronts are covered by small round
shapes.  The soil here is a rich loam, that is slightly damp.

A sea of enormous ferns covers the area.  Each fern tops over ten feet

a creeping rhizome, and they do not forming clumps.  The fronds are large
fertile leaf-like greenery, that stands erect.  Each frond is relatively
narrow, and has edges with deeply cut ribs, oblong lobes that have smooth
edge.  There are about a dozen lobes per frond, and they run
perpendicular to the stem.  The underside of the fronts are covered by
small round shapes.  The spheres are the spore-bearing sori used in fern
reproduction.

Thick mud and muck cling to the plant here, even as they grow up out of

These ferns are smaller than their land cousins.  They are a light green,
and reside along the surface of the water.  A network of spidery thin
root-veins branch out from beneath each plant.  The light green fronds
lean backward as the sprout nearly a foot into the air from the waters
surface.  The leaf stalks are a straw-color, with light brown scales. 
The fronds are in the shape of a blade, broadly triangular, and usually
longer than wide, tapering rapidly to narrow tip.  The lowest pair of
leaflets are somewhat more widely spaced from the rest, and typically
drooping down to touch the waters surface.  The whole of the ferns are
coved in a light dusting of yellow powder.

These bulrushes are water plants that grow in the open waters of the
sulfur ponds, where the water depth is less than a few feet deep.  The
roots of the bulrush reach down deep into the organic-rich mud on the
pond bottom.  The bulrushes form a mat of plant material that covers the
surface of the pond, and bubbles of sulfur gas vent up out of the
material at uneven intervals.

There are several colors of water lilies that grow on the sulfur pond
here.  The most hardy seem to be the yellow ones.  The lilies, which
produce blooms over a long season, hold their flowers above the water
surface.  The fragrant flowers of the lilies cannot be smelled, due to
the high sulfur content of the air.  The water lilies have lightly
mottled leaves that are slightly shade tolerant.  The leaves are green
with a slight pink undertone, and spread out across the surface of the
pond.  Some of the leaves are larger around than a full-grown male ogres
hand.  The lilies leaves and flower edges are tipped with yellow mud and
sulfur crystals.

These are the dark green weeds that occupy the edge of the water, and

bean.  Some of these waterweeds look to be edible, and you could consider
picking some if you were desperate enough to eat them.

A large bubbling pool of water serves as a vent for noxious sulfur gasses. 
The waters of the large pool churn with inner turmoil.  The pool, which

pool is a wall of rock.  The wall of rock is covered in a spongy moss
blanket, and the cliff face rises steeply from the waters edge.  The
cliff is forested at the top with a grove of mountain beeches.  Some of
the ancient beech trees have low-lying branches that drape down close to
the waters edge.  A wall of mud blocks any further progress to the south. 
The wall supports large amount of plant life, and wild ferns can be seen
covering its sides and its crest.

Sulfur Pools~
Bubbling sulfur erupts from the muddy surface of the pool creating a
cloud of yellowish gas that even a troll would be proud to create. 
Bulrushes and flax plants line the water, their waxy leaves immune to the
acrid water bleched from the ground.  The rotting remains of an ancient
tree rises throught the mire, its surface caked in sphagnum and mud.

have had a height of nearly one hundred twenty feet.  Its once high perch
does it no good now, as it lay in a mire of mud and fetid water.  The
mosses that cover the tree have tiny white lobe like leaves that are
slightly tinged with red and sometimes green

mountain beech tree branches~
This one mountain beech is a fairly large tree, being approximately sixty
feet tall.  Its trunks is around two feet wide.  The bark of this tree is
a light gray and smooth to the touch.  The beech's leaves grow up to five
inches long, and they're ovate in shape with a pointed tip.  The leaves
have short stalks and saw-toothed edges.  The leaves are a dull dark
green on top and light green on the bottom.  The flowers of this beech
are clustered together in one inch yellow balls, and spread throughout
the branches.  The fruits is this tree are a little less than one inch in
length, and they are long and prickly.  A light coating of yellow dust
covers the branches, leaves, and trunk of the tree, and the parasitic
sphagnum and old man's beard the climb the trunk and branches.  The
smaller beech trees in the area are overrun with the tree parasites.
~
E
old man's beard~
The old man's beard is a common climbing tree parasite.  It has a dense
festoon of greenish-gray hair-like flexuous strands, that it anchors to
the tree trunk and branches by sparse wiry roots.  This tree parasite is
a vigorous deciduous climber having panicles of fragrant green-white
flowers thoughout the summer and autumn.  This plant bears numerous
panicles of small creamy white flowers 
~
E
dripping sphagnum~
This sphagnum is a common moss that grows only in a very wet, acid area. 
These mosses have white leaves that are slightly tinged with red and
sometimes green.  These mosses are typically found growing in marshy
places such as this bog.  These pale and ashy mosses sink to the bottom
of the bog when they die and help make the spongy bottom of this sulfur
pond even clingier.

the high sulfur content of the air.  The water lilies have lightly
mottled leaves that are slightly shade tolerant.  The leaves are green
with a slight pink undertone, and spread out across the surface of the
pond.  Some of the leaves have grown to be larger around than a
full-grown male ogres hand.  The lilies leaves and flower edges are

On a Limb in a Tall Beech Tree~
A precarious path of tangled branches juts out from the trunk of the
tree, allowing a well balanced individual to shimmy along its soft barked
surface.  Below the ground looks close enough to drop down upon without
too much injury, however a smattering of rocky obstacles present an
increase in a would-be daredevils drop.

High in a Tall Beech Tree~
The trees canopy parts allowing for a reasonable view of the forest to
the north and west, although many other trees rise above this ones high
do ruin the view somewhat.  Lacking in strength and secure handholds
there appears to be no further option to climb upwards.  Down below the
clusters of branches would make for an easy descent.
