corpses~
The corpses of many different woodland animals are stacked here against
the wall.  They appear to have been placed there on purpose from the
manner in which they are stacked.  You can also detect a very small crack
in the wall to the south, it's covered by most of the corpses.  
~
E
crack~
The crack runs up the south wall of the tunnel, to a height of about six
feet, west three feet, and back down to the floor of the tunnel.  
~
E
wall~
The wall appears to have a faint outline of a door on it.  There is no
visibile handle or keyhole though, perhaps it is just a trick of the eye
helped by your light.

Jailer's Office~
Carved from the living rock of the cavern, the jailer's office is a cozy
little room.  A small desk and comfortable chair sit nearby the gate that
leads into the prisoner's cell to the south.  The walls are bare, save
for one painting of a gnome that graces the northern wall.  An iron gate
leads to the cell, while to the east you can head towards the Home
Guard's office.

painting~
Hanging about in the center of the northern wall is a small portrait of a
martronly looking gnomish woman.  While not, perhaps, of the highest
quality, the picture captures well the tender expression on the woman's
face.

Jail Cell~
The cell here is quite spartan.  The walls are bare, and have been
recently painted a sickly, pink color.  The floor is smooth, the stone
worn down by the pacing of bored inmates.  A thick gate made of iron set
into the north wall provides the only means of exit.

Home Guard's Office~
Carved into the cavern wall, this curved chamber houses the Home Guard. 
Near the entrance sits a large desk, positioned to have a clear view of
those who enter.  A weapons rack and Home Guard uniforms hang along the
south wall in a iron cage.  In the west wall is hewn a small archway,
leading to another chamber beyond.  To the east a small tunnelway exits
out into the Marketplace.

Thick bars of iron line the south wall, caging off a portion of the room
to act as a storage for weapons and uniforms.  Swords, crossbows and
several other types of weaponry hang in neat rows from iron hooks, while
shelves hold fresh uniforms like those of the Guard.

Inside the Gates of Orlumber~
A wide, flagstone courtyard sits behind a large and ornate set of steel
gates to the west.  A worn, cobblestone road leads north, alongside the wall
of the cavern.  To the south, another broad thoroughfare heads towards a
bustling marketplace.  The stout, metal gates completely cover the large
tunnel that leads out of the open cavern.  A rising wall with a tile mural
blocks movement to the east.

West Market Entrance~
The wide road turns north and east, heading into a marketplace to the
east, and a small courtyard to the north.  A wide tunnel has been carved
out of the cavern wall to the west, leading into a small office. 
Flanking the entrance to the east are two massive brick pillars.  Atop
each sits a small granite bowl, water spilling over its side and
trickling down the columns into a small pool.  The sound of the water is
soothing, and the air is cool and pleasantly damp.  Solid, red flagstones
pave the marketplace, their well-worn condition evidencing heavy traffic.
~
[Eliza] First sentence in rdesc is awkward..  perhaps say: The road runs
north into a small courtyard and eastward toward a bustling marketplace.
[Eliza] extra sign: Make the sign message in color?
[Eliza] 2nd sentence: A wide tunnel.. change to wide opening? 
[Eliza] Add extra for opening? Its carved out, is it smooth, rough?
[Eliza] add extra for the pools formed by dripping water or are they just puddles.

Pyrope Street~
The flagstone road heads north and south, running between the cavern wall

is old and weatherworn, its wooden shingles warped and split with age. 
One of the windows has been boarded up, and weeds grow in the yard.  Just
to the south is a large open area, and what looks to be a massive steel
gate.

Grigotsky's Bistro - Dining Room~
Stained woods are masterly used to create an intimate yet exciting
atmosphere in this dining room.  Plants hang in pots and sit in planters
helping to screen out each table from its neighbors.  The tables
themselves are beautiful works of art: Small bistro tables covered in
artworks of tile.  Tucked into the southeast corner, almost hidden by
plants is a discreet stairway.

The worn and bumpy flagstone road leads north and south between the
cavern wall and the row of houses to the east.  A short brick wall
separates the house to the east from the road, and the wall has seen
better days.  Loose bricks in the wall threaten to collapse it, and an
old and bent iron gate rests against it at an angle.  You can follow the
road north or south.

full of weeds.  The road leads north towards a curve and south by more

Intersection of Beryl Road and Pyrope Street~
Beryl Road curves along the base of the cave wall, meeting with Pyrope
Street to the south.  Pyrope heads south, wending its way past the houses
of some of the inhabitants of Orlumber to the east.  The cavern wall
shoots straight up here, ultimately curving back on itself and showing
the open sky above you.  To the east you can see a wide bridge that
arches over a small stream that runs behind the houses.

A small bridge arches over a small stream that cuts through the stone
floor of the cavern.  The stream burbles merrily as its heads southward
underneath the bridge.  The water appears to come from a split in the
cavern wall to the north and spilling into a small pool just to the north
of the bridge.  Just to the west Beryl Road curves to the south,
following the curve of the cavern wall.  You can follow Beryl Road east,
also.

The Marketplace~
The open shopping plaza, known simply as the Marketplace, spreads out
towards the east.  The wide, flagstone-paved courtyard is bounded by many
different styles of buldings, and luxurious trees are planted to break up
the monotony of the open space.  To the north sits a small shop with
ornate windows, occasional puffs of steam issuing from pipes in the roof. 
A stone building of large proportions rests firmly to the south, a clean
white smoke bursting in gouts from the stack on its roof.

A intricate tangle of gleaming, metal pipes and long, glass tubes sit
over small heating fires and cooling baths.  An occasional gust of steam
issues from a crack in the piping, releasing a sickly-sweet smell.  The
back of the shop is quite cluttered, but the waiting area and the counter
are spotless.  An open door leads south and out to the marketplace.

Metal Armor~
A hot forge burns white hot, as white smoke is sucked silently up a
chimney.  Several suits of metal armor hang on fitting dummies near the
back of the shop.  The dirt floor is hard-packed, covered with a thin
layer of ash.  The stone walls seem to radiate heat, making this an
uncomfortable room to be in.  You can head out towards the marketplace to
the north.

A Citizen's Dwelling~
You are standing in a small house, it only has one room.  A small stove
sits over in the corner, you can feel the heat radiating from it.  A
couple of beds are pushed against the west wall, all clean and neatly
made, but worn.  A large table sits in the center of the room, surrounded
by many chairs.  This is obviously the home of one of the many gnome
laborers and his family that you have seen walking around this city.  A
door in the east wall leads out to Calantar's Way.

Iriaebor Street - Cul-de-Sac~
A quiet and gently curving cul-de-sac ends the private and secluded
cobbled walkway.  A brick wall curves around the dead end, covered with
ivy that barely hides the sharp iron spikes that top it.  A heavy iron
gate is set into the wall to the north, and peeking through the gate
shows that there is a lush garden beyond.  Aside from going through the
gate, south is the only direction you can travel.

This small, one room, cottage is home to one of the many gnome laborers
that live in Orlumbor and his family.  There are a few cots pushed up
against the west wall, and a large table dominates the center of this
room.  A few cheap wooden toys are scattered about the floor, making it
dangerous to walk around if your not paying attention.  The doorway to
the east leads back out to Calantar's Way.  The residence of this cottage
will not appreciate your presence should they catch you here.

Iriaebor Street~
A large iron gate is set into the brick wall to the west.  Just beyond
the gate is a large arbor, covered in purple wisteria.  The road here is
cobblestone, with green grass and small clumps of mints growing in the
spaces between the stones.  The ivy covered brick wall also blocks you to
the south, bordering the cobbled walkway.  The road heads north just a
little bit further, ending in a quiet cul-de-sac.

an iron gate interrupts the wall, and a large building can be seen beyond
that.

opening to the east into a small park.  The cobbled street runs to the

inside.  The plaza is paved with flagstones and planted with large trees
and smaller shrubs.  Just to the northeast is a small and quiet pond.  To
the south an open-faced building rests, the smell of wax coming from
steaming vats in plain view.  You can head either east or west along the
plaza.

The Marketplace - South of Pond~
The calm blue waters of a small pond splash quietly along the grassy
shoreline just to the north of the plaza.  The pond rests in a shallow
hollow, and willow trees dot the shoreline, their long wispy branches
trailing into the waters.  A wooden pier heads north out into the lake. 
Just to the south, a smaller street cuts off the main Marketplace plaza,
and under a archway.  You can see several shops that line the road in
that direction, and the area appears to be much more upscale.  The main
plaza heads east and west towards more shops.

Intersection of Merchant's Lane and the Marketplace~
Heading south from the busy marketplace, this quiet tree lined lane heads
into a small shopping district.  From its looks, and the lack of
commoners, you would surmise this to be a wealthier part of town.  The
lane is paved with brick, and lined with flowering trees along each side
of the road.  To enter the lane you would pass under a large wrought-iron
archway, decorated with a creeping rose bush that dangles its flowered
vines from the arch.

Several bronze statues decorate the plaza here, set on pedastals that
place them high above the shoppers.  A small two-story tower sits behind
a row of shrubs to the north, its stout walls broken only by the open
doorway and several small leaded-glass windows.  The smell of food wafts
in from the gingerbread style building to the south.  To the northwest
you can see a small willow-lined pond with a small pier jutting out into
it.  The open plaza continues east and west.

The counter of this store is very close to the door, giving you very

shelves line the back of the store, and are covered with many bottles and

and a stack of brown scroll paper that appears to be blank.  Above the
desk several purple balls of light hover in the air.  An open doorway

large doors flung open to the marketplace.  Heavy red flagstones provide
solid footing between the seemingly randomly planted trees.  The plaza
continues to the west and to the east past a crumbled building.

Weapons by Pantell~
This is one of the cleanest shops you have ever seen.  Weapons hang from
racks in neat rows, displayed proudly and highly polished.  The waxed and
polished wood floor practically gleams, reflecting the bright metals of
the weapons.  Several small tabbards of the Home Guard hang from wooden
dowls in the back of the shop.  The heavy stone walls are clean and dust
free, with obviously used sets of weapons and old shields hanging as
decorations.  To the south you can head out the wide doorway.

The plain wooden walls of this store are hung with lanterns, bags and

is comfortable to shop in.  You can head to the marketplace through the

The marketplace continues heading east and west here.  To the south, a
wooden door sits in the middle of an imposing stone wall topped by thick,
outwardly directed iron spikes.  A small hedge also runs along the foot
of the wall, softening the harshness of its appearance.  You can walk
along the tree-dotted marketplace towards the west, or head east past a
large and imposing bulding.

A Narrow Alley~
This dark and dingy street is more like an alley than a road.  Shattered
buildings line the alley, smashed by tons of rock.  their walls listing
at dangerous angles.  Rocks and debris litters the pathway between the
ruined buildings, leading north towards more of the same, and south
towards a bustling marketplace.

East Entrance of the Marketplace~
Dominating the area is a large red-brick archway spanning the wide
walkway.  Ivy grows up and around the arch, thick leaves and green
foliage inviting you to pass beneath the arch and into the market.  To
the north a large building sits, thick stone walls with no windows or
other openings.  A large trellis has been attached to the wall, and
several small vines are beginning to grow on it.  To the south sits a
rather large and imposing building made of polished black granite.  You
can head west towards the marketplace or east towards an open plaza
before a huge temple.

double doors leads out to the north.

Open Courtyard - West of the Marketplace~
An open courtyard of slate flagstones spreads out before you.  To the
east, the open plaza continues, leading up to a massive brownstone
building that appears to be a temple of some sort.  The irregular and
polished slate creates a natural feel to the courtyard, and makes it a
pleasant place to wander.  Just to the west you see the entrance arch of
a busy marketplace.

Before a Great Church - Open Courtyard~
A large open plaza spreads out before you, its large slate flagstones
polished to a high shine.  The smooth black stones reflect the massive
brownstone temple to the east, its faint outline wavering in the slightly
uneven surface.  The plaza stretches off to the west, leading towards a
busy marketplace far in the distance.  A brick archway leads south into a
small lane, and another path leads off to the north between two large
statues.  A large stairway leads into the temple to the east.

North Industry Lane - By the Statues~
Two massive bronze statues seated on impressive granite dais's flank the
brick-paved lane.  The statues show signs of damage and wear, but are
still quite impressive.  The cavern wall follows the lane northward,
curving over the lane and arching high above you.  To the north the lane
continues towards a few large buildings along the west side of the road. 
To the south a large courtyard opens up.

The high walls of this temple soar high above you, coming together in
several flying arches.  Thousands of shining gems encrust the walls, and
reflecting the light from the many hanging lanterns.  The dazzling
display of light dances across the walls and floor, giving the room a
colorful and ethereal quality.  A small doorway leads east into a small
room, and larger doors are set into the north and south walls.  A huge
set of open doors provides exit to the west, leading to a long stairway.

contrast to the plain walls, a large altar shines against the far wall. 
Several candles flicker as they melt upon the altar, their light dancing
across the gems with a supernatural glow.  A soft pillow sits in front of
the altar, to allow you to kneel in more comfort.  A small door leads

A quaint and comfortable tree lined lane heads south from the busy

between the trees, leading between the rows of shops.  The sweet smells
of a bakery waft in from the comfortable looking shop to the east, and to
the west many shiny trinkets sit in the window of the well lit store.  To
the south the lane continues for some distance.  To the north an iron
archway spans the lane.

Calantor's Way - Park Entrance~
The well-worn and ancient cobblestone road ducks through a high stone
arch, quickly changing into a sparkling white gravel walkway that
meanders through the park.  A stone fence sits to each side of the
archway, offering itself as a break between the park to the east and the
busy street to the west.  The scents of freshly cut grass and flowers
mingles and wafts through the air, enticing you to spend some time in the
park.

Worker's Park - By the West Arch~
The winding gravel pathway slides between the cut grass on each side, and
the occasional well-groomed thistle patch.  Large topiaries, shaped into
various figures, grow along the gently rolling park grounds.  Just to the
west a large archway interrupts the stone wall running to from the north
to the south.  Beyond the archway the path becomes a cobbled road
bustling with people on the move.  The path splits to the east and the
south as well as heading under the arch.

Ivy climbs up the broad northern archway to the Worker's Park.  The
ancient stone is still beautiful, and provides a wonderful separation
between the working class buildings to the north.  The cobblestone
walkway enters the park and slowly fades out in a fan shape as it is
taken over by a white gravel path that leads to the east and west.  Green

Industry Lane - Before the Park Arch~
The cobbled walk known as Industry Lane runs parallel to the cavern wall
to the east.  A large brick building flanks the street to the west, its
large double doors open to the street.  An ivy covered archway spans the
cobbled walk, leading into a large park that sits under the area of the
cavern that is open to the sky.  To the north, a row of well-kept brick

The wide brick lane leads north and south alongside the cavern wall.  A
large stone warehouse sits astride the lane, looming high above you, its
walls nearly touching the cavern walls as they soar up and over the lane. 
The building shows signs of repair, the stones that make up its upper
walls being a much different color.  To the north the lane continues just
a little further, coming to an end in front of another large building. 
Southward, the lane continues towards two massive statues.

North Industry Lane - Dead End~
The brick-paved lane ends in a semicircle here, butting up against the
cave wall towards the northeast, and a large stone building to the west. 
The cave wall is split by several large cracks here, testament to the
time of the collapse of the Great Dome.  The lane itself shows signs of
repair in places, newer bricks replacing those that must have been
shattered in the cataclysm.  An overpowering smell of tallow comes from
the building to the west, as do great gouts of steam.

Tallow Factory~
Steam and heat greet you as you enter this building.  Huge bronze kettles
boil with animal fats as part of the rendering process.  The steam makes
vision difficult, and almost takes your breath away as it invades your
lungs.  Several platforms rise above the kettles, providing a place to
survey the process from.  Cooling kettles, and crates clutter the
factory, as well as coal and woods used to heat the kettles.

Simple flagstones make up the road here, worn and damaged from years of
use and neglect.  The road runs east and west alongside the cavern wall
to the north.  Just to the south a narrow alleyway disappears between a
destroyed, brick building and boarded up derelict on the east.  The road
runs off quite a distance to the west, but appears to be blocked by
rubble to the east.

The narrow alleyway trailing southwards squeezes between a pair of

boarded up, the frame itself burnt and charred by obvious fire damage.

Running alongside the cavern wall the road jogs slightly with the
cavern's natural curve.  Worn flagstones attest to the age of this
construct, the stone worn in places by the passage of heavy wagons and
countless feet.  Just to the south, a shattered building wall stands
defiantly, refusing to collapse.  Beyond the barrier, broken bricks lie
in jumbled heaps, all that remains of a once large and proud structure. 
You can follow the road to the east or west.

Clouds of black smoke belch from the building to the south, and even from
the road you can feel heat coming from inside.  The worn out flagstone
road cuts between the building and the cavern wall, which is covered in
black soot.  Thankfully, most of the smoke seems to be naturally drawn
out of the open top of the cavern.  You can follow the road west or head

Brickworks~
Clouds of reddish dust boil through the hot air, swirling about as the
heated air rises.  The sounds of raging fires burn deep within the guts
of the large building, firing the kilns that heat and dry the bricks. 
Empty and half-full crates sit near stacks of completed bricks.  In the
center of the room is a huge hole in the ground, from which an endless
stream of buckets filled with red clay seem to be coming.  To the east
you can exit the brickworks.

Several large earthen kilns, built mostly from the same reddish bricks
they harden, are set up in this building.  The kilns are large and
bottleshaped, angling inwards towards the roof, chimneys for the thick,
black smoke to escape from.  The bricks are placed inside the kilns by

Common House~
The dirty floor is covered in a sticky layer of red clay that seems to
have been tracked in from the west.  Seven cots line the north and south
walls respectively, each neatly made with crisp and clean sheets.  Along
the east wall sits a large table with several chairs pushed underneath it. 
A sturdy wooden staircase heads up towards the second floor.  There is a
heavy ash door on the west wall.

Lining the walls both north and south of the room, are fourteen cots,

Built into the east wall, a sturdy wooden staircase, with an ash handrail

the steps, as if someone had used them to scrape their boots on.

Olivine Avenue~
The road comes to a dead end herem curving into a sweeping cul-de-sac
boarded on the east and west by large buildings.  To the south is a dense
row of stately willow trees, lazily dragging their drooping branches on
the ground.  To the north, the worn flagstone road heads towards an
intersection near the cavern wall.  Just beyond the trees you can see a
stone wall.

Heavy stone columns parade back and forth in this huge building,
supporting the ceiling above.  Sounds of trade echo back and forth and
making it so you almost have to shout to get the attention of the person
next to you.  The walls are polished marble, while the floor itself is a
smooth black granite with white veins.  Along the west wall is set a
large counter where gnomes run back and forth carrying parcels.

A Narrow Alley~
Two crumbling buildings stand on each side of the narrow walk.  The doors
of each are missing, and despite the extensive damage the walls appear to
be somewhat stable.  The building to the west is made mostly of wood, and
it looks like the roof has caved in.  The eastern building is a built of
a solid and dark brick, and appears to have fared better than the other
buildings in the area.  The narrow alley leads north and south.

Shattered Remains of a House~
Splintered timbers and cracked planks fill most of the space inside this
shattered building.  Large stones and boulders lay inside the crumpled
walls, most likely the cause of the destruction of this building.  It
looks as thought every inch of the place has been stripped of everything
of value, as nothing but bare wood and rusty nails remain.  You can walk
through a gaping hole in the east wall and out into the alley.

Strewn about the crowded remains of the shattered building, broken beams

In amongst the cracked beams and timber planks, several large stones and

The gaping hole evident in the eastern wall of the building looks like it

Flophouse~
The dark stone walls of this bleak building give it a somber and
depressing air.  Stinking piles of cloth and straw are scattered about
the room, apparantly beds of some sort.  The air reeks of sweat, and a
clinging dust covers most every surface.  It is difficult to find a clear
space on the floor to walk, as it appears quite a few people call this
home at one time or another.  An open doorway leads out into the alley to
the west.

To the east a burned out shell of a house sits, its walls blackened by
fire.  Empty windows and doors stare out onto the alley, unblinking and
sightless.  The brick walls hold deep rifts of ash within, and burnt
timbers lay about like shattered bones.  To the west of the alley a small
home appears to have come through much of the cataclysm unscathed,
however huge boulders and wreckage from the surrounding buildings litter
the area around the building.  To the alley continues to the north and

Charred and fire-blackened, the brick walls of the building that lies to

Burnt Out Brick Building~
Barren and scarred walls lean tenously inward, threatening to collapse at
the slightest provocation.  Thick rifts of rubble-strewn ash cover the
ground, hiding hazards and making movement dangerous.  Charred timbers,
the remnants of the roof and floor joists, litter the ground and lean
against the walls.  An open doorway leads out to the alleyway to the west.

Large piles of shattered brick mingle with heavy stones making the alley
even narrower here.  Much of the brick appears to be from the destroyed
building to the west, which has collapsed into the street.  Sitting next
to the alley on the east side is a rather large and impressive structure. 
Its windows have been boarded up, as has its door.  Despite this, and the
obvious fire damage, the building appears in decent shape.  The alley
merges out onto a street to the north, and continues to wind its way
through the rubble to the south.

Worker's Park - By a Fountain~
The immaculate white gravel path wraps itself around a large, gurgling
fountain.  Rimming the base of the fountain, nestled in the cool shadows,
a small hedgerow keeps you at a respectable distance from the edge of the
stone pond that the fountain's waters cascade into.  A small bench sits
under the reaching branches of a citrus tree bursting with scented
flowers.  After circling the fountain, the pathway wanders north and off
to the east as well.  The wall of the cave wraps itself around this
corner of the park to the south and west, hiding behind a green and white
blanket of ivy.

The white gravel path curves south and west here, avoiding a slight bulge
in the cavern wall to the northeast.  A thick mass of ivy grows from the
park's green hills and climbs the rough cave wall.  To the northwest you
see one of the grand archways that feed into the park.

The gently rolling park grounds create an atmosphere that is relaxed and
peaceful.  At the top of each slight rise sit large, well trimmed topiary
figures.  The gravel pathway wanders between the rises, going towards one
figure, then another as it winds its way to the east and west.  To the
west the pathway climbs a rise, leading to a large fountain.  Ivy climbs
the cave wall that rises to the south.

Set between the rolling slopes of the park and the curving wall of the

rest of the park, the topiaries and thistle beds have been torn apart
here.  The grass dies in patches, and the thick carpet of ivy along the
walls browns in areas.  The remains of a broken bench are strewn about
the grounds, and the stripped remains of a fruit tree stand like a
skeleton on one of the taller rises.

Comfortable Garden~
Swaying willow trees shade this yard, while a tiny fountain gurgles
gently in one corner.  A curving pathway leads indirectly to the plain
front door of the brick building.  Soft, green grass carpets the ground,
except beneath the willows, where a bed of baby's breath seems to fare
better in the shade.  High stone walls encircle the yard, overgrown with
ivy and flowering vines of various sorts.  Set into the stone wall is a
heavy iron gate, ornately wrought and emblazoned with a crest.

Encircling the comfortable yard, high stone walls, built of brick, enfold

clinging vines, of ivy, jasmine, and a few others, permeating the
courtyard with their sweet scent.
~
E
gate crest~
The heavy iron gate is ornamentally wrought, swirling patterns of flowers
between its dull iron bars.  The crest emblazoned in the centre of the
gate is a single rose in bloom, surrounded by a bed of ivy flowers on the
backing of a dull iron shield, firmly welded to the gate.
~
E
willows trees grass baby's breath~
The earth of this front garden has been sown with a thick grass,
obviously kept short and well-trimmed frequently.  The soft grass covers
most of the garden, except for the sweeping garden path, curving between
the low-hanging branches of the willow from the eastern iron gate to the
front door of the building.  Growing beneath the willow trees in well
tended clumps, are short flowering bushes of baby's breath, their white
flowers adding a touch of color to the shade beneath the trees.
~
E
pathway building~
Sweeping from the eastern iron gate of the courtyard to the front door on
the western side of the garden, a wide cobblestone path twists and turns
its way through the well-tended garden, no weeds gracing its stony
surface.  The building to the west is made of a fine, red brick, jasmine
growing up and around the windows, a fine varnished oak door standing
prominently at the end of the path.
~
E
fountain~
Isolated away in the corner of the garden, beneath the shade of the
sweeping willow trees, a tiny stone fountain gurgles away, its watery
splashes murmuring quietly, barely percievable.  The fountain is carved
in a quartercircle, its two straight sides meeting the ivy-covered walls
of the garden.  Standing as a centrepiece of the fountain is a statuette
of a naked boy holding a waterjug, the water pouring from its spout to
splash into the stone birdbath below.

Standing tall on the west side of the garden, a dusky red-bricked
building stands tall, a full two stories in height.  A grey slate tiled
roof frames the top of the building, a couple of loose tiles visible
above the structures walls, which look to be decades old.
~
E
door windows~
Flanking the ornately carved oaken door is a pair of shuttered windows,
the varnished shutters also made of rich oak, the shutters currently
closed.  A second set of windows stands a story higher, built directly
above the first pair, its open shutters looking down over the garden. 
The door itself has been embossed with a criss-crossed pattern of
diagonal squares, making its surface look almost like a patchwork quilt.
~
E
bushes trees~
A few small trees, among them an oak, an apple, and a flowering cherry,
dot the yard.  The oak stands the tallest of the trees, just below the
roofline of the house, the other two barely reaching the height of the
upper set of windows.  Dispersed amongst the trees, barely reaching a
couple of feet in height, are many small bushes, some dotted with the
sweetly-scented purple and mauve flowers of lavender bushes.
~
E
pathway bench~
Winding its way between the trees, a smooth cobbled pathway extends from
the front door to the eastern gate, passing by the small, fragrant
lavender bushes and a wrought iron bench.  The bench itself is rather
plain looking, a rounded seat and back with horizontal iron slats, but
looks rather comfortable, not a speck of rust adorning its surface.
~

A simple iron gate sits in a stone archway on the eastern end of the yard.

Lavish Entryway~
Heavy tapestries and gilded mirrors hang along the walls of this cramped
but stylish entry.  A dark-stained cherry wood stairway climbs up towards
the second floor, curving gently as it rises.  The floor is white-veined
black marble tile, and thick rugs cover much of it.  A small coatrack
sits quietly to the side of the door.  Two open doorways lead out of the
room, one to the south, they other to the west.  You can go out the front
door to the east.

as if they were sewn of finely trimmed bearskins.  Rising up towards the
second floor in a gentle arc, a dark-stained cherry wood staircase
compliments the rugs adorning the floor perfectly, the colour a close
match.
~
E
tapestries mirrors~
A pair of silver-rimmed gilded mirrors hangs against the southern wall,
framing the doorway.  Both mirrors have been polished to a fine sheen,
their surfaces well reflective.  Fine woven silk tapestries cover most of
the other walls, one depicting a landsape of flowing hills and green
fields at sunset, another showing the face of a pudgy gnomish woman,
backed with roses.

The coatrack standing idly to one side of the door is brass-plated,

but more to keep the sharp edges of the mirrored glass covered.

Entrance to a Grand Estate~
You are on a packed gravel walkway that curves gently beneath trees and
leads towards a large building to the west.  The walkway is lined with
stands of quaking aspen trees, their leaves flashing brilliantly in the
breeze.  Just to the east is a large brick fence bisected by an ornate
iron gate.  A thick carpet of low-cut green grass spreads out beneath the
shade of the trees.

You are in a tiny cave, with barely enough room to move inside.  A steep
tunnel dives down, looking like it might be a tight squeeze.  The curved
walls have been scratched out of the hard stone.  Dust and pebbles litter
the floor, making footing dangerous.  To the west a thick blanket of ivy
hangs down, covering the tiny mouth of the cave.

The cramped tunnel splits in several directions here.  A steep tunnel

stale, and the weight of the stone above is oppressive.  Some deep
scratches in the stone stand out along the south wall.

Tunnel Spiraling Downwards~
The tunnel spins downward into the darkness below you.  Rough stone and
many small ledges provide plenty of hand and footholds for you in
climbing up or down.  The tunnel twists and turns several time as it
leads up and down.  At several points it looks like the squeeze will be a
tight one.  From below you hear the sound of dripping water echoing
through the tunnel.

A sickening smell fills the room, probably coming from the rotting pile

The tunnel turns into an almost vertical shaft as it winds its way
through the bowels of the earth.  The tunnel walls are quite rough,

Water laps quietly against the small stone ledge you are on.  The ledge

Richly Appointed Room~
This basement room is decorated with all manner of fineries.  Expensive
wallpaper covers the upper portion of the walls, while rich oak wainscot
runs about the room about five feet high.  A crystal chandelier glows
with magical light, giving the room a relaxed feel.  Several glass
cabinets with books in them line one wall behind the low counter.  Behind
the counter sits a comfortable chair.  Busts of various gnomes rest on
marble pedestals in the corners, and fine oil paintings hang gracefully
from a picture rail that also rims the room.  A fine staircase carved
from oak climbs up towards a barely visible trapdoor.

The walls of this room are panelled with a rich oak all the way around,
each panel six inches or so in width, the edges sanded on an angle to
create a groove between the individual boards.  The fine timber wainscot

mottled wallpaper, its colours various hues of grey, white and mauve,
both subtle and pale.
~
E
crystal chandelier~
Hanging from the ceiling in the centre of the room by a thick,
silver-plated chain is a fine crystal chandelier.  The base of the
chandelier is an eight-pointed star in design, lined with fine,
many-faceted crystals, all the same size and shape.  At the apex of each
point of the star is a crystal globe, glowing with an ever-burning light
whih could only be magical in origin.
~
E
books cabinet~
Lining one wall behind a low counter, several large oak-panelled cabinets
stand proudly, their fronts obscured only by a sheet of glass.  Safely
locked away inside the cabinets are many fine, leather-bound books, their
titles not quite legible through the thick glass.  Hinged in silver, the
varnished oak cabinets are held closed with an ornate silver lock, a tiny
keyhole visible in the centre of each.
~
E
counter chair~
A low counter of dark mahogany sits prominantly before the cabinets,
whorls and knots in the finely grained surface enhanced by the rich
varnishing of the wood.  Behind the smooth counter, an expensive-looking
cushioned armchair sits, its red leather coverings looking smooth and
supple.  The velvet cushions on the armchair are sewn with a fine silver
thread, the colours of the soft material matching the chair perfectly.
~
E
busts pedastals~
Marble busts of the heads and shoulders of what can only be assumed to be
prominant gnomes sit on carved marble pedastals in the corners of the
room.  The bases are shaped like pillars of silver-veined white marble,
gleaming in the seemingly magical light of the chandelier.  The busts set
atop the pedastals are in a darker, more greyish marble, the features on
each head superbly detailed.  All four of the heads are male, and facing
the centre of the room from their respective corners.
~
E
rail paintings~
Hanging from a fine silver picture rail, fine oil paintings gracefully
rim the walls.  The majority of these elaborately framed works of art are
landscapes, but there are a few spectacular portraits dispersed among
them.  All of the paintings are very exquisite, covering eyecatching
scenes such as a sunrise over mountains, a deep green riverside forest,
and a sunlit hill draped in a blanket of wildflowers, but to name a few.

Climbing up in a spiral, a fine oaken staircase works towards a trapdoor

strong and sturdy in construction.

High mounds and shattered piles of brick cover this whole area.  What

of cracked and shattered brick.  Intermingled with the brick are huge
stones that must have assisted in the demise of the building.  The only
wall that remains standing lines the road just to the north.  To the west
you see the back of a building that appears to have avoided the fate of
the houses on this alley.

The hard packed dirt road ends here in a deep pile of rubble and stone. 
Huge blocks of stone and piles of rubble litter the road, as it appears
nobody has even tried to clean up the mess here.  Ivy has begun to grow

fresh water filling them.  The small wooden tables sitting beside each
tub are mostly empty, though some have an item or two atop them, such as
a bar of soap, or a folded towel or article of clothing.

brightly striped wallpaper, is a deep and richly coloured landscape
painting, framed in oak.  The painting is a scene of a crystal clear
pond, willows encircling the edges of it, their branches gently sweeping
against the water, creating small ripples in its surface.  Behind the
painting, and indeed, over the majority of the walls in the room, are
brightly coloured vertical stripes of pastel covered wallpaper, giving a
softer air to the room.

E
stairs carpet~
Along the northern wall, a sturdy staircase of darkly stained oak extends
upwards, climbing towards the floor above.  Cushioning the stairs, a
decorated carpet of red with tassled edges of a golden wool has been
firmly secured to the base boards.

The Sitting Room in the Brick House~
This cozy room is furnished with all sorts of cushiony and fanciful
furniture.  Every inch of the walls is taken up with paintings,
trophies and decorative wallpaper.  There is so much furniture
and junk in here that it is difficult to find a place to walk.  Two large
windows face east, towards the wall of the cavern and a garden below.  An
ornate set of stairs leads down.  To the west is a dark oak door.

walls paintings trophies wallpaper~
Peeking out from beneath the many trophies, and other memorabilia
covering the walls can be seen a faint, floral wallpaper.  The faded
flowery print is barely perceptible beneath the myriad of items on the
walls.  Among the most noticable things covering the walls, a pair of
large landscape paintings, a large shield emblazoned with a white cross,
a pair of ancient, crossed swords, and many others too numerous to
comprehend.
~
E
furniture~
Dominating most of the northern wall, a large, comfortable looking couch
sits, its velvet coverings looking soft and cushy.  Scattered over the
room are at least three more armchairs, two done in the same deep red
velvet, and one, near an ornate looking grate which seems to be in front
of an out of use fireplace, is an old cracked armchair of red leather.
~
E
grate fireplace~
Made of red brick, and built into the southern wall, a fireplace can
barely be seen behind all the wall coverings.  Beneath patchy wallpaper,
the red bricks of a fireplace can be seen, dusty and old, as if it has
been out of use for a long time.  The grate covering the fireplace is a
mostly solid piece of bronze, carved cunningly into the shape of a great
galleon on a sea of waves.
~
E
landscape paintings~
Both of the large landscape paintings are of what seems to be a dark
forest, caught from different angles, a stream running through part of it. 
One of them shows a waterfall underneath the dark shade of the trees,,
and both paintings seem to be by the same artist, though the signature is
illegible.
~
E
shield~
The shield looks as if it is a kite shield, made of bronze.  Firmly
affixed to the wall by large bolts, the simple pattern of a white cross
against a black background stands out against the floral print of the
walls.
~
E
swords~
Affixed to the walls point up, a pair of very ancient looking sabres has
been mounted by large bolts.  Made of iron, and with obvious rust
staining the blades, these swords are in a serious stare of disrepair.

Kitchen in the Brick House~
Cabinets line the north wall, while a heavy iron stove is set next to a
long marble countertop.  The wall near the stove is covered in decorative
tiles depicting various farm animals.  Inside the cabinets are dishes and
glasses arranged in neat little rows.  A small window along the west wall
is ajar, letting in a cooling breeze.  An open doorway leads east into
another room of the house.

Lining the northern wall, beneath a silvery-veined white marble benchtop,
many cabinets of varnished oak have been built.  A couple of the cabinet

order.
~
E
stove tiles~
Sitting in the corner of the room on four stubby legs, a heavy potbellied
stove rests.  With a black cast iron body and a small grated door, this
stove has sufficient room atop for a kettle or pan.  Beside the stove, a
stack of tinder and firewood rests, ready for use.  Near the stove, the
tiles on the wall depict a myriad of different farm animals, cows, sheep,
goats, chickens, in various states of activity.
~
E
window 1 west~
Standing slightly ajar, the small window set in the western wall allows a
glimpse outside, as well as allowing a light airy breeze in.  The window
itself, framed in oak, is rather small, and has a windowbox outside
filled with a small variety of herbs.  Beyond the windowbox a larger
garden can be seen below, an old wagonwheel set into the grass with a
much larger spread of herbs growing inside it.

This bedroom is a cluttered mess.  Clothes have been thrown haphazardly

the surface of most everything.  A shuttered window looks westward.  To
the east is a oaken door.

Lying untidily in one corner of the room, many old bedsheets are

Thrown about the room with little regard for tidiness, clothes of all
kinds litter the floor.  Among the articles of clothing are old shirts,
skirts, trousers, socks, and various items of underwear.  Many of the
items seem to be show signs of mildew, or being eaten by rats, mice, or
other vermin.

Faded and dusty, some of the landscape paintings hanging on the wall look
to have suffered serious water damage.  Most of the paintings look to be
of forest or hilly scenes, though through the damage done to them, the

discern many specific details.

A large brick fireplace dominates the kitchen, a large black pot hanging
over the ashes of the fire.  The worn old floor shows the scars of years
of use, and the counters are cluttered with the remains of half eaten
meals.  A small oval window looks out towards the back of another
building to the west.  An open doorway leads northward.

Built into the southern wall of this room, the large red-bricked
fireplace looks as if it is in regular use, reddish embers barely visible
in the greyish ash below the pot.  A small stack of firewood sits to one
side of the fireplace, ready for use, and an iron poker leans against the
opposite side.
~
E
pot~
Blackened by fire, this heavy looking cast-iron pot is rounded at the
base, with three short stubby legs.  It hangs over the fire by an iron
handle looped over a hook embedded in the roof of the fireplace.  Upon
further inspection of the pot, the remains of some sort of thick, meaty
stew can still be seen in the bottom of it.
~
E
floor~
The varnished wooden floorboards look far from new, showing the scratches
and nicks of years of use.  Near the fireplace, especially, three shallow
depressions in a circular pattern can be noticed, as if something heavy
often rested there.
~
E
counters~
Lining the east and west walls of this small kitchen, a pair of wooden
counters have been cluttered with many plates, cups, and dishes.  Several
of the simple tin plates have the remains of what looks to be half
consumed meals on them, some chicken bones and mashed potato here, slices
of roast beef with gravy there.  More often that not, though, it seems
the meat has been eaten and the vegetables left in their place.
~
E
window~
The simple oaken frame of this oval shaped window has been filled with
glass.  Its design is such that it is not intended to be openable, rather
just an orifice for looking out of.  Unfortunately, there is little to be

across it.

The scent of pipe-smoke hangs heavily in the air of this dark room. 
Thick cushioned couches and over-stuffed high back chairs sit in a
semi-circle, while little side-tables have been positioned almost
randomly about the room.  The floor is heavily carpeted, with several
intricately patterned rugs competing for attention.  A glowing gem hangs
in the midst of a crystal chandelier, its feeble light struggling against
the thickly decorated chamber.  Several ashtrays are heaped with ashes,
and several pipe cleaners sit in twisted heaps near each.  The windows
are covered with slatted wooden shutters.  An open doorway leads out to

Overflowing with cushions and stuffing, a pair of soft looking couches

Haphazardly scattered around the room, many carved oaken side-tables have

climb out of the pond and between the willows to that side.

the pond, making it seem like an isolated piece of nature in this
bustling town.  In fact, the only signs of civilization in this areas is
the pier to the south, extending out over the pond.  To the north,
between two willow trees, the ground looks to be sloped gently enough to
allow suitable traction to climb onto the bank.

Before a Grand Estate~
A massive and expensively decorated brick building rises high above you
to the west.  Wooden shutters grace the sides of the windows, while a
black-painted set of double doors provides an entrance to the building.
The building appears to be only two-stories high, but spreads out in a
gentle curve far to the north and south.  Well-trimmed hedges flank the
sides of the building, and between the windows taller junipers grow high
into the air.  A gravel path loops around a small fountain in front of
the building, eventually heading east down a tree-lined lane.
